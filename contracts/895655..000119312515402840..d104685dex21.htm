iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this " _Agreement_
"), dated as of December 13, 2015, among Jarden Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Newell Rubbermaid Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), NCPF Acquisition Corp. I, a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and NCPF
Acquisition Corp. II, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (" _Successor Sub_ ").

 

RECITALS

A. The parties wish to effect a business combination through (i) the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
entity (the " _First Merger_ "), and (ii) immediately following the First
Merger, the merger of the Company, as the surviving entity of the First
Merger, with and into Successor Sub, with Successor Sub being the surviving
entity (the " _Second Merger_ " and, together with the First Merger, the "
_Mergers_ ");

B. The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), the board
of directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ "), the board of directors of
Merger Sub and the board of directors of Successor Sub have each unanimously
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
stockholders to consummate the Mergers;

C. The parties intend that the Mergers will qualify as a "reorganization"
under Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement will constitute a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the Code; and

D. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in connection with the Mergers and also to prescribe certain
conditions precedent to consummation of the Mergers.

 

Accordingly, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, and other good and
valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which hereby is acknowledged,
Parent, the Company, Merger Sub and Successor Sub, intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:

I. THE MERGERS; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME

1.1. _The Mergers_. On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), (a) at the First Effective
Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, with the Company
surviving the First Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (the
Company, as the surviving entity in the First Merger, sometimes being referred
to herein as the " _First Surviving Corporation_ "), and (b)  immediately after the First Effective Time, and as part of the same plan of
reorganization, at the Second Effective Time, the First Surviving Corporation
will be merged with and into Successor Sub, whereupon the separate existence
of the First Surviving Corporation will cease, with Successor Sub surviving
the Second Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (Successor Sub, as
the surviving entity of the Second Merger, sometimes being referred to herein
as the " _Ultimate Surviving Corporation_ "). The Mergers will have the
effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in Section 259 of the
DGCL.

 

1.2. _Closing_. Unless Parent and the Company agree otherwise in writing, the
closings of the Mergers (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of
Jones Day, 1420 Peachtree Street NE, Suite 800, Atlanta, GA 30309, at 9:30
a.m. local time on the 12th Business Day following the day on which the
last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) have
been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement, _provided_ , that
in no event may the Closing take place prior to March 31, 2016. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_."

 

1.3. _Effective Times_. Prior to the Closing, the parties will have prepared,
and on the Closing Date, the parties will cause (a) a certificate of merger
with respect to the First Merger (the " _First Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
duly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
as provided under the DGCL and make all other filings, recordings and
publications required to be made by the Company or Merger Sub under the DGCL
in connection with the First Merger and (b) immediately following the First
Effective Time, a certificate of merger with respect to the Second
Merger (the " _Second Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the
DGCL and make all other filings, recordings and publications required to be
made by the First Surviving Corporation or Successor Sub under the DGCL in
connection with the Second Merger. The First Merger will become effective at
such time as the First Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware or on such later date and time as may be
agreed upon by the Company and Parent and expressly set forth in the First
Certificate of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the
" _First Effective Time_ "). The Second Merger will become effective at such
time as the Second Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or on such later date and time as may be agreed
upon by the Company and Parent and expressly set forth in the Second
Certificate of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Second Effective Time_ "). The First Effective Time will, in all events,
precede the Second Effective Time.

 

1.4. _Governing Documents_. (a) At the First Effective Time, the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the
First Effective Time will be amended and restated in their entirety to read as
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub (except as to the
name of the Company, which will be Jarden Corporation, the name of the
incorporator, which will be deleted, the name of the registered agent and the
address of the registered office) and, as so amended, will be the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the First Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



2 (b) At the Second Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of Successor Sub in effect immediately prior to the Second Effective Time
will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation (except as to the name of the Ultimate Surviving Corporation,
which will be Jarden Corporation) until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

1.5. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Entities_. (a) From and
immediately after the First Effective Time, (i) the officers of Merger Sub
will be the officers of the First Surviving Corporation and (ii) the directors
of Merger Sub will be the initial directors of the First Surviving
Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacity, resignation or removal.

 

(b) From and immediately after the Second Effective Time, (i) the officers of
the First Surviving Corporation will be the officers of the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation and (ii) the directors of the First Surviving
Corporation will be the initial directors of the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacity, resignation or removal.

1.6. _Plan of Reorganization_. The parties intend that, for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, the Mergers, taken together, will constitute
integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan of
reorganization the parties adopted by executing this Agreement.

II. EFFECT OF THE MERGERS; EXCHANGE

 

2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the
First Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub,
Successor Sub, Parent or the holders of any securities of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or Successor Sub:

(a)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ", and each, a "
_Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than an Excluded Share)
will be converted into the right to receive, and become exchangeable for (i) a
number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ")
equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") _, _and (ii)
$21.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together
with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the First
Effective Time, all Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _Section 2.1(a)_ will cease to be
outstanding, will be canceled and will cease to exist, and (i) each
certificate that immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented any

 



3  such Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") and (ii) each uncertificated Share
represented by book entry on the stock transfer books of the Company (a "
_Book-Entry Share_ "), in each case, will thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, and the right, if any, to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ cash in lieu of fractional shares into which
such Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ and any
distribution or dividend pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_.

(b)  _Treatment of the Company Equity Awards_. (i) Each Company Option that
is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time will, as of the
First Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, fully vest (to the extent unvested) and, in exchange for the
cancellation of such Company Option, entitle the holder thereof to receive,
for each Net Option Share underlying each such Company Option, the Merger
Consideration.

 

(ii) Each unvested Company Restricted Stock Award (other than a Rollover
Restricted Stock Award) that is outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time will, as of the First Effective Time, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof become vested and be canceled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each
Share underlying such Company Restricted Stock Award.

(iii) Each Rollover Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding immediately
prior to the First Effective Time will, as of the First Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled in exchange for a restricted stock award covering a number of shares
of Parent Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole share, equal to (A)
the total number of Shares subject to such award of Rollover Restricted Stock
Award immediately prior to the First Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the sum
of (1) the Stock Consideration plus (2)(I) the Cash Consideration divided by
(II) the Parent Closing Price (a " _Substitute Restricted Stock Award_ ").
From and after the First Effective Time, each Substitute Restricted Stock
Award will be subject to similar vesting conditions and payment terms as were
applicable to such Rollover Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the
First Effective Time, and the terms set forth in _Section 4.1(a)(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(iv) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) will adopt resolutions providing for
the treatment of the Company Options and the Company Restricted Stock Awards
(collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this
_Section 2.1(b)_. As soon as practicable (but not later than ten Business
Days) after the First Effective Time, Parent will prepare and file with the
SEC a Form S-8 (or file such other appropriate form) registering a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parents obligations under
this  _Section 2.1(b)_.

(v) Payment of any cash amounts to be paid in respect of Company Equity Awards
may be made through the Ultimate Surviving Corporations payroll system.

 



4 (c) _Treatment of the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the
First Effective Time, the Company Board or the appropriate committee thereof
will take all reasonable actions, including adopting any necessary resolutions
or amendments with respect to the Company ESPP, to (i) terminate the Company
ESPP effective immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) provide that any
offering period in progress on the Closing Date will be shortened in
accordance with Section 24 of the Company ESPP such that the last day of such
offering period will be the tenth Business Day prior to the Closing Date (the
" _Final Purchase Date_ "), with purchases made on the Final Purchase Date to
be contingent on the Closing and (iii) avoid the commencement of any new
offering period under the Company ESPP at or after the Final Purchase Date
and prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article VII_ or the First Effective Time.

 

(d) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub will be automatically
converted into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Shares of the Company_. Each
Share held in the treasury of the Company or held by Parent or any of the
Company or Parents wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (the " _Canceled Shares_ ") will automatically be canceled and
retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in
exchange therefor.

2.2. _Effect of Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the
Second Merger and without any action on the part of the First Surviving
Corporation, Successor Sub, Parent or the holders of any securities of the
First Surviving Corporation, Successor Sub or Parent, (a) each share of
capital stock of the First Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time will be canceled and retired
and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered therefor and
(b) each share of common stock of Successor Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time will remain outstanding and
will represent shares of common stock of the Ultimate Surviving Corporation.

 

2.3. _Exchange of Shares and Certificates._

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Not less than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Parent will designate a bank, trust company or nationally recognized
stockholder services provider reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange agent in respect of the Mergers (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
purpose of exchanging, in accordance with this _Article II_ , Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. Parent will deliver to the
Exchange Agent, as needed, (i) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (together with any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.3(e)_ , the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and (ii) certificates or book-
entry shares representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be delivered as the Stock Consideration in respect of the
Shares. Parent will instruct

 



5  the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this Agreement. The Exchange Fund will not be used for any purpose other than
to fund the payments required pursuant to this _Article II_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. (i) As promptly as practicable after the First
Effective Time, but in any event within two Business Days, Parent will cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was, as of immediately prior to
the First Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares (other than the
Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ")) entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_: (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and containing such provisions as mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Company (including a provision confirming that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
such holders Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof pursuant to such
letter of transmittal. Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares will be effected in
accordance with the Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to
securities represented by book entry.

 

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent
for cancelation, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent (or in the
case of DTC, the customary surrender procedures of DTC and the Exchange
Agent), the holder of such Shares will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, together with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.3(e)_, and any distribution or dividend pursuant to _Section
2.3(c)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and
shares may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is properly
endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment pays any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

(c) _Distributions with respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
First Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or uncanceled Book-Entry Share with respect to any shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares will be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section
2.3(e)_, in each case until the surrender or cancelation of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to
applicable Law, following surrender or cancelation of any such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_ , there will be paid to
the holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or cancelation, the amount
of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional

 



6  share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.3(e)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the First Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
First Effective Time but prior to such surrender or cancelation and a payment
date subsequent to such surrender or cancelation payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in the Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange or cancelation
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article II_
(including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_, _Section 2.3(c)_ or
_Section 2.3(e)_) will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and there will be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares. If,
after the First Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they will be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_ , except as otherwise
provided by Law

 

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates, receipts or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued upon the conversion
of Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of Shares converted pursuant to the First
Merger who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all Shares held as of immediately
prior to the First Effective Time by such holder) will receive, in lieu
thereof, from the Exchange Agent an amount in cash (without interest) rounded
up to the nearest whole cent equal to (i) the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled to
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ multiplied by (ii) the closing sale price of
Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Closing. As promptly as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash to be paid to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will
make that amount available to those holders, without interest.

(f) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
following the one-year anniversary of the First Effective Time will be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ will
thereafter be entitled to look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
any shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock.

 

(g) No Liability. None of the parties hereto or the Exchange Agent will be
liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration
delivered

 



7  to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been
surrendered or canceled prior to seven years after the First Effective Time,
or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash, any shares of
Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock or any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares,
cash, dividends or other distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share will, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(h) _Investment of Merger Consideration_. The Exchange Agent will invest the
aggregate Cash Consideration delivered by Parent pursuant to  _Section
2.3(a)_ as directed by Parent in direct short-term obligations of (or direct
short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by) the
United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days,
in commercial paper rated "P-2" or "A-2" or better by Moodys or SandP,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital in excess of $5 billion
(determined by reference to the most recent financial statements of such bank
that are then publicly available), pending payment thereof by the Exchange
Agent to the former holders of Shares as required pursuant to this _Article
II_ ;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no investment of such deposited cash
funds will relieve Parent or Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments
required by this _Article II_ , and that no gain or losses on such investments
will affect the cash payable to former holders of Shares pursuant to this
_Article II_ and following losses, if any, from any such investment, Parent
will provide additional cash funds to the Exchange Agent, for the sole benefit
of the former holders of Shares in an amount necessary to ensure that the
funds available to the Exchange Agent are at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments to former holders pursuant to this _Article
II_ , which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as
the requisite cash funds initially deposited with Exchange Agent. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments will be the property of and
will be promptly paid to Parent.

 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, each of the parties and the Exchange Agent will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law, as determined
by the parties in good faith. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld and paid over to or deposited with the proper Governmental Entity,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary form and
amount as 

 



8  indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and unpaid dividends and other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof,
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

2.4. _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time that are held by any stockholder of the Company that is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such stockholders Shares
pursuant to, and that complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, but, instead, such holder will be entitled to
such rights as are granted by Section 262\. At the First Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares will no longer be outstanding and automatically will be
canceled and will cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by Law,
each holder of Dissenting Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to
the Dissenting Shares, other than such rights as are granted under Section
262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder of Dissenting Shares
fails to validly perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to
appraisal under Section 262, or if a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262, then, in each case, the rights of such holder under Section 262 will
cease, and such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to have been converted at the
First Effective Time into, and will have become, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_. The Company will not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent may be given or
withheld by Parent in its sole discretion, voluntarily make (or cause or
permit to be made on its behalf) any payment with respect to, or settle or
make an offer to settle with, any holder of Dissenting Shares regarding its
exercise of dissenters rights prior to the First Effective Time. The Company
will give Parent notice of any such demands prior to the First Effective
Time, and Parent will have the right to participate in all negotiations and
Actions with respect to any exercise by any holder of Dissenting Shares of
dissenters rights.

 

2.5. _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
First Effective Time, the outstanding Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock
are changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
dividend payable in stock or other securities or other similar transaction,
the Exchange Ratio and related provisions will be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of Shares and Parent Common Stock or the Company Equity
Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange,
dividend or other similar transaction, except, that (i) nothing in this
_Section 2.3_ will be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement and (ii) cash dividends, share repurchases and grants of equity
compensation in each case made in the ordinary course of business and in
accordance with the terms hereof will not result in any adjustment to the
Exchange Ratio.

 



9 2.6. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Second Effective Time, the
officers and directors or managers, as applicable, of the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company, Merger Sub or Successor Sub, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
thereof, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in Parent or the Ultimate Surviving Corporation, any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by Parent and the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Mergers.

Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting that has become false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no representation or
warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made

supplied by Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement. The information supplied by the

permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals
of all Governmental Entities that are required for the operation of the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Permits_ "),
except where the failure to have any such Company Permits, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
the terms of the Company Permits and all applicable Laws relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or properties,
except where the failure to be in compliance with such Company Permit or Law,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No action, demand, requirement

 



16  or investigation by any Governmental Entity and no Action by any Person, in
each case with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties, is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome of which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(ii) Except as set forth on _Section 3.1(h)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, since January 1, 2013, there has not been, and there is no pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened recall or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, investigation of, or with respect to, any of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries product offerings required by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission or any other Governmental Entity that, individually or in the

Effect. Since January 1, 2013, the Company has not received any written
notice or, to the Companys Knowledge, other communication from the Consumer
Product Safety Commission or any other Governmental Entity of any actual or
alleged violation of any Law governing product recalls, product safety,

affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or any of their respective officers or directors before any court

the PPACA and federal securities laws. The Internal Revenue Service has

adversely affect such determination, except for any such events that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Companys Knowledge, no condition
exists that is reasonably likely to subject the Company or any Company ERISA
Affiliate to any direct or indirect liability under Title IV

trusts related thereto, the Company or its ERISA Affiliates except where
such claims or Actions would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or any other material

or any current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(B) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company
Benefit Plan, (C) result in any material acceleration of funding or vesting of

Material Adverse Effect, there are no complaints, charges or claims against
the Company pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to be

subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken ( _provided_ ,
that such disclosure will be deemed to qualify that particular subsection and
such other subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably

its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which

and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, except, as to
Subsidiaries, for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized,
existing or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept)
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing

Filed SEC Documents.

Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary action on the part of Parent, subject, in the case of the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the First Merger, to the Parent
Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Parent and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by each of the other parties hereto, constitutes the legal,

make the statements therein not false or misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to Parents stockholders or at

false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no representation
or warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference therein based on or derived from information supplied by the
Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement. The information supplied by Parent for

precedent (including pursuant to "any "market flex" provisions in the related
fee letters or otherwise) related to the funding (except for reductions
expressly contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters) of the Financing, other
than the conditions precedent expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters (such

 



38  conditions precedent, the " _Financing Conditions_ "), (iii) as of the date
hereof, the Debt Commitment Letters have not been amended, restated or
otherwise modified or waived in any manner, and no such amendment,
restatement or other modification or waiver is contemplated or pending, and
(iv) as of the date hereof, the respective commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn, terminated, reduced or rescinded
in any respect and no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or recession is
contemplated (except for reductions expressly contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters). Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company made to Parent and the Companys compliance with its
obligations under this Agreement, as of the date hereof, Parent has no reason
to believe that (A) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied
on or prior to the Closing Date or (B) the full amount (except for reductions
expressly contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters) of the Financing will
not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. There are no side
letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to the
Financing to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party as of the date
hereof other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters
furnished to the Company pursuant to this _Section 3.2(r)_ (other than terms
that have been redacted as provided above). All commitments and other fees
required to be paid under the Debt Commitment Letters prior to the date of
this Agreement have been paid in full. The aggregate net proceeds
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, together with cash on hand or
borrowings under Existing Credit Facilities, will provide Parent and Merger
Sub with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of
all of Parents and Merger Subs cash payment obligations under this Agreement
and under the Debt Commitment Letters (including the payment of the aggregate
Cash Consideration and any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent,
Merger Sub, Successor Sub, the First Surviving Corporation or the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation in connection with the Mergers and the Financing, and
payments required in respect of any required refinancings or repayments of
existing indebted of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). Parent
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations hereunder, including its, Merger
Subs and Successor Subs obligations to consummate the Mergers, are not
subject to, or conditioned on, the funding of the Financing or the receipt of
any financing.

(s) _Parent Benefit Plans and Labor Matters_. (i) Except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent Benefit Plan is in compliance with
its terms and with all Laws, including ERISA, the Code, the PPACA and federal
securities laws. The Internal Revenue Service has determined that each Parent
Benefit Plan that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of
the Code is so qualified and Parent is not aware of any event occurring after
the date of such determination that would adversely affect such
determination, except for any such events that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. To Parents Knowledge, no condition exists that is reasonably likely
to subject Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate to any direct or indirect
liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than required minimum contributions
to a Parent Benefit Plan, including any Multi-Employer Plan) or to a
civil penalty under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or liability under
Section 4069 of ERISA or Section 4975, 4976, or 4980B of the Code or other

 



39  liability with respect to Parent Benefit Plans, in each case that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. To Parents Knowledge, no "reportable event" as that
term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA has occurred with respect to any
Parent Benefit Plan within the last five years. To Parents Knowledge, except
as set forth on  _Section 3.2(s)(i)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent
and its ERISA Affiliates do not now and for the last five years have not been
obligated to contribute to a Multi-Employer Plan or to any other plan
described in Section 413 of the Code. There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened, claims (other than routine claims for
benefits or immaterial claims), or any Actions by or notice from a
Governmental Entity by, on behalf of or against any Parent Benefit Plan, any
trusts related thereto, Parent or its ERISA Affiliates except where such
claims or Actions would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(ii) Except as provided by this Agreement, and set forth on _Section
3.2(s)(ii)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event) would reasonably be expected to (A) result in any "excess
parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or any
other material payment (including material severance, unemployment
compensation, forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any
current or former director or any current or former employee of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, (B) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable
under any Parent Benefit Plan, (C) result in any material acceleration of the
funding or vesting of any such benefits, or (D) constitute a "change in
control" or similar event for the purposes of any material Parent Benefit
Plan.

 

(iii) No Person is entitled to receive any additional payment (including any
Tax gross-up or other payment) from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as a
result of the imposition of any excise or additional Taxes, interest or
penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

 

(iv) Except for such matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, there is no
(A) unfair labor practice, labor dispute or labor arbitration proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against or affecting Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) lockout, strike, slowdown, work stoppage
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threat thereof by or with respect to any
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(v) Since January 1, 2013, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has complied
with all Law relating to employment and employment practices, including wages,
hours, collective bargaining, unemployment insurance, workers compensation,
equal employment opportunity, classification of employees and contractors,
age and disability discrimination, the payment of withholding Taxes, and the
termination of employment, except to the extent that noncompliance would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Except

 



40  as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, there are no complaints, charges or
claims against Parent pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened to
be brought or filed with any Governmental Entity based on, arising out of, in
connection with, or otherwise relating to the employment of, or termination of
employment by, Parent of any Person including Actions under the Workers
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.

(vi) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not require
the consent of, or advance notification to, any works councils, unions or
similar labor organizations with respect to employees of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than any such consents the failure of which to obtain or
advance notifications the failure of which to provide as would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(t) _Taxes_. (i) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

(A) (1) all Tax Returns required to be filed by Parent and its Subsidiaries,
have been timely filed (taking into account any extensions), (2) all such Tax
Returns were true, complete and correct in all respects, (3) all Taxes shown

reflected on such Tax Returns) required to have been paid by Parent and its
Subsidiaries have been paid or adequate reserves have been recorded in the
Parent Financial Statements, (4) all Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries that
are not yet due and payable have been adequately reserved for in the
Parent Financial Statements, and (5) Parent and its Subsidiaries have duly
and timely withheld all Taxes required to be withheld in connection with any
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
stockholder or any Third Party, and such withheld Taxes have been either duly
and timely paid to the proper Taxing Authority or properly set aside in
accounts for such purpose;

 

(B) no written Contract or other written document waiving or extending, or
having the effect of waiving or extending, the statute of limitations or the
period of assessment or collection of any Taxes relating to Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has been filed or entered into with any Taxing Authority, and
no power of attorney with respect to any such Taxes has been granted to any
Person, in each case, that remains in effect;

(C) (1) no audits or other administrative proceedings or proceedings before
any Taxing Authority are presently pending with regard to any Taxes or Tax
Return of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as to which any Taxing Authority
has asserted in writing any claim, and (2) no Taxing Authority has asserted in
writing any deficiency or claim for Taxes or any adjustment to Taxes with
respect to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable with respect
to income or other Taxes that has not been fully paid or finally settled, and
_Section 3.2(t)(i)(C)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter lists all federal,
state, local and non-U.S. material Tax Returns of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that are currently the subject of audit by any Governmental
Entity or other Tax authority;

 



41 (D) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (1) is a party to or bound by
or has any obligation under any Tax indemnification, separation, sharing or
similar Contract or arrangement (other than exclusively among Parent and its
Subsidiaries), (2) is or has been a member of any consolidated, combined,
unitary or similar group for purposes of filing Tax Returns or paying Taxes
(other than a group of which Parent is the common parent corporation), (3) has
entered into a closing Contract pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code, or any
predecessor provision or any similar provision of Law, or (4) has any
liability for the payment of Taxes of any Person as a successor or transferee;

(E) none of the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
Lien for Taxes (other than Permitted Liens); and

(F) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any listed
transaction, or any reportable transaction that has not been properly
disclosed on a Tax Return in accordance with Law, within the meaning of
Sections 6011, 6111 and 6112 of the Code or any similar provision of Tax Law
in any other jurisdiction.

(ii) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either
a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation"(within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to
qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (A) within the
past two years or (B) that could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or
"series of related transactions"(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the
Code) in connection with the Mergers.

 

(iii) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows
of any fact, Contract, plan or other circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to prevent the Mergers from qualifying for the Intended Tax
Treatment.

(u) _Real Property_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (A) Parent
and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable fee title (or the

property, and good and valid leasehold title to all of its leased property
pursuant to leases with Third Parties which are enforceable in accordance with
their terms, in each case subject only to Permitted Liens, (B) there are no
existing (or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) condemnation proceedings
with respect to any such real property and (C) with respect to all such leased

or one of its Subsidiaries has any continuing obligations (all such Contracts,
the " _Parent Material Contracts_ "). Each Parent Material Contract is valid
and binding on Parent (or, to the extent a Subsidiary of Parent is a party,
such Subsidiary) and is in full force and effect, and Parent and each
Subsidiary of Parent has in all material respects performed all obligations
required to be performed by it to date under each Parent Material Contract,
except where such noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not

Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge of, or has received written
notice of, any violation or default under (nor, to the Knowledge of Parent,
does there exist any condition that with the passage of time or the giving
of notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any

broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to
any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon

with such deductibles and against such risks and losses, as is reasonably
prudent given Parents circumstances. Except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) all material
insurance policies and programs maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and (ii) such policies provide
coverage in such amounts and against such risks as is sufficient to comply
with applicable Law. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the
material terms of all material insurance policies and programs and have not
failed to give any material notice or present any material claim under any
insurance policy or programs within the time periods required. To the
Knowledge of Parent, there are no pending notices of cancellation or non-
renewal of any such insurance policy or programs nor has the termination of
any such insurance policy and program been threatened in writing by the
provider of such insurance.

Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the Company or any of

expectation of the Mergers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent acknowledges that none of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries nor
any other Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied,
as to accuracy, completeness or achievement of any financial projections,
forecasts, cost estimates and capital budgets relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries made available to Parent.

anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, including _Section
4.2(b)_, if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company receives from any Person a written expression of interest,
proposal or offer that the Company Board determines in good faith, After
Consultation, constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to, a Company
Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of _Sections 4.2(a)_  or

exchange offer, or a temporary "stop-look-listen" communication by
the Company Board (made pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act);
(iv) fail to publicly recommend against a Company Alternative Proposal, or
fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case,
within 10 Business Days after any written request of Parent to do so
subsequent to any public announcement by any Person of a Company Alternative
Proposal that has not been withdrawn prior to Parents request; or (v) enter
into, approve, adopt or recommend, or resolve or propose publicly to enter
into, approve, adopt or recommend any Company Alternative Proposal or any
letter of intent, agreement-in-principle, expression of interest, term sheet,

agreement, asset sale or transfer agreement, restructuring, reorganization or
recapitalization agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement, or other Contract providing for or relating to a
Company Alternative Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) (any action in clause (i) through (v) being hereafter referred to
as, a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(e) _Change in Recommendation Permitted in Certain Circumstances_. Prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change solely in the manner and to the extent
hereafter expressly set forth in this _Section 4.2(e)_ in response to (x) a
Company Superior Proposal that did not result from a violation of this 
_Section 4.2_ or (y) a Company Intervening Event, in each case only if the
Company Board determines in good faith, After Consultation, that a failure to
do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
under applicable Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
at no time may the Company make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
unless: (i) the Company notifies Parent in writing of its intention to duly
convene a meeting of the Company Board to consider making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, which notice to Parent must be delivered

 



52  by the Company within 24 hours after the Company determines to convene such
meeting, but in any case, not less than five Business Days before such meeting
is convened, and which notice will include, (x) if the meeting of the Company
Board at which a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is to be considered is
in response to a Company Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person making
the Company Superior Proposal and a true and complete copy of all
documentation comprising the most current version of such Company Superior
Proposal (including all proposed transaction agreements, including exhibits
and schedules) or (y) if the meeting of the Company Board at which a proposed
Company Adverse Recommendation Change is to be considered is in response to a
Company Intervening Event, a detailed description of all underlying facts,
conditions and circumstances giving rise to the occurrence and continued
existence of the Company Intervening Event, (ii) for five Business Days
following receipt by Parent of such notice, the Company and its
Representatives negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives
with respect to any proposal from Parent to amend or modify the terms of this
Agreement (to the extent Parent has notified the Company that it so desires to
negotiate such amendment or modification), and (iii) if the meeting of the
Company Board at which a proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change is to
be considered is in response to (x) a Company Superior Proposal, Parent does
not make, within such five-Business Day period, a binding offer in the form of
a proposed definitive amendment to this Agreement (which, if accepted by the
Company, will become a binding agreement among Parent, Merger Sub, Successor
Sub and the Company) that, as determined by the Company Board in good faith,
After Consultation, has caused such Company Alternative Proposal to no
longer be a Company Superior Proposal (provided that any proposed amendment
or modification to the material terms of a Company Superior Proposal by any
Person who previously submitted the same to the Company will require a new
written notice to Parent from the Company and a three-Business Day period
notice and negotiation period thereupon will commence under this _Section
4.2(e)_), or (y) a Company Intervening Event, Parent does not make, within
such five-Business Day period, a binding offer in the form of a proposed
definitive amendment to this Agreement (which, if accepted by the Company,
will become a binding agreement among Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub and
the Company) that, as determined by the Company Board in good faith, After
Consultation, obviates the need for the Company Board to make the Company
Adverse Recommendation Change. For purposes of clarification and certainty,
under no circumstances will the Company be permitted to terminate this
Agreement in respect of a Company Superior Proposal unless it concurrently
complies in all respects with the requirements of this _Section 4.2(e)_ and
_Section 7.1(h)_, and under no circumstances will the Company be permitted to
terminate this Agreement solely in respect of, or following any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made by the Company Board solely in response to,
a Company Intervening Event. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub
each hereby expressly confirm and agree that the immediately preceding
sentence of this _Section 4.2(e)_, to the extent that it relates to the
Company Adverse Recommendation Change solely in response to or in respect of a
Company Intervening Event, has been agreed to for all purposes of Section 146
of the DGCL.

(f) _Required Notices._ The Company will notify Parent or its Representatives,
in writing, promptly (and in any event not later than one Business Day)

 



53  after it receives or otherwise becomes aware of any Company Alternative
Proposal or any written inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Alternative Proposal, which notice must include a description of the
material terms of such proposal and the identity of the Person making such
proposal, and the Company will keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
of any such proposal (including any material changes, modifications or
amendments thereto). The Company will promptly provide to Parent (and in any
event not later than one Business Day after receipt or delivery thereof) all
drafts of Contracts relating to any Company Alternative Proposal and
any written proposals containing any material terms of a Company Alternative
Proposal. The terms and existence of any such Company Alternative Proposal,
and the identity of such Person, will be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(g) _Disclosures Under the Law_. Nothing contained in this _Section 4.2_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement will prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to the holders of Common Stock a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a), or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, under the Exchange
Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the holders of Common Stock under
applicable Law if the Company Board determines in good faith, After
Consultation, that the failure to do so would violate applicable Law
(including the fiduciary duties of the Companys directors under
applicable Law), _provided, however_ , that nothing in this _Section 4.2(g)_
permits the Company to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except in
the manner and to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 4.2(e)_, and it
is hereby acknowledged and agreed that a factually accurate public statement
by the Company that describes only the Companys receipt of a Company
Alternative Proposal and the operation of the provisions of _Section 4.2_
and  _7.1(h)_ of this Agreement, will not be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (if, and only if, such public statement expressly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation as of the date of such public
statement).

(a) _Termination of Existing Discussions_. Parent, each of its Subsidiaries,
and the respective directors, officers, employees and controlled Affiliates

Proposal, (iv) "opt out" of or waive, or take any action to render
inapplicable to any Person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) or
any Parent Alternative Proposal, the provisions of any Anti-Takeover Laws, or
(v) engage in, continue or participate in any discussions or negotiations with
any Person (except solely to notify such Person of the existence of the
provisions of this _Section 4.3_ and, to the extent necessary, to obtain
clarification of the terms of any such expression of interest, proposal or
offer), with respect to any such expression of interest, proposal or offer,
or (vi) provide any nonpublic information or access to the business,
properties, assets, liabilities, books or records of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person (or any Representative of any Person) who has made,
has informed Parent of any intention to make, or has publicly announced an
intention to make, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Parent Alternative Proposal. Parent will be
responsible for any action or inaction taken by its or its controlled

that the Parent Board determines in good faith, After
Consultation, constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to, a Parent
Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of _Sections 4.3(a)_ or

made available to any such Person in accordance with the preceding sentence
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is first made
available to such Person.

V. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

5.1. _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement; Stockholders
Meetings_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent will jointly prepare, and Parent will file
with the SEC, the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, ensure that
the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act and keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary
to complete the Mergers. Each of the Company and Parent will furnish to the
other party all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders
of Shares and Parent Common Stock and provide such other assistance as may
reasonably be required by such other party in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement. The Company
and Parent will, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide
the other party copies of any written comments and advise the other party of
any oral comments, with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement
received from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to
any comments received from the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement,
and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly
as practicable with respect to any comments received from the SEC with
respect to the Form S-4. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the
contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference)
to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 will be made without the
approval of both the Company and Parent, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to documents filed by a party that are incorporated by reference
in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, this right of approval will apply
only with respect to information relating to the other party or its business,
financial condition or results of operations, or the combined entity, and
provided further, that this approval right will not apply with respect to
information relating to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing
the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing in
definitive form the Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto), or responding to any comments received from the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and 

 



58  Parent will cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final
version of such document or response). The Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Parents stockholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, in each
case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent will advise the Company promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order relating thereto, the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in the First Merger for offering and sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. Parent will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have any such stop-order or suspension
lifted, reversed, vacated and terminated. Parent also will use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all such other action reasonably required to be
taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or
state securities or "blue sky" Law and the rules and regulations thereunder in
connection with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the First Merger,
and the Company will furnish all information concerning the Company and the
holders of Shares as may be reasonably requested in connection with such
actions. If at any time prior to the First Effective Time any information
relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not false or misleading, the party which discovers such
information will promptly notify the other parties hereto, and the Company and
Parent will cooperate, in good faith, in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the
extent required by Law, prompt dissemination of such information contained in
such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company and Parent, as
applicable.

 

(b) The Company will, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act, in accordance with applicable
Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, establish a record date for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the
" _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, any approvals related thereto
including the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act
in connection therewith and will, subject to the provisions of  _Section
4.2(e)_, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders the adoption
of this Agreement in the Joint Proxy Statement, and will solicit and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.
The Company may only postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting (i)
to solicit (and re-solicit) additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining
the

 



59  Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, and (iii) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental
or amended disclosure that the Company has determined, After Consultation, is
reasonably likely to be required under Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of the
Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company will permit
Representatives of Parent to attend the Company Stockholders Meeting.

(c) Parent will, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Parent Charter and Parent Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Parent
Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder
Approval and will, subject to the provisions of _Section 4.3(e)_, through the
Parent Board, recommend to its stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement the
approval of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the First Merger
and will solicit and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Parent
Stockholder Approval. Parent may only postpone or adjourn the
Parent Stockholders Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose
of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a
quorum, and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that Parent has determined,
After Consultation, is reasonably likely to be required under Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
stockholders of Parent prior to the Parent Stockholders Meeting. Parent will
permit Representatives of the Company to attend the Parent Stockholders
Meeting.

(d) The Company and Parent will use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders
Meeting at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the same date, which date will be as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act.

5.2. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and subject to Law, upon reasonable notice, each of the Company and
Parent will, and will cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to
the other party and to the officers and Representatives of such other
party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the First Effective Time, to all their
respective properties, books, Contracts, commitments, employees, and records (
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that such access will not unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of such party), and during such period, each
of the Company and Parent will, and will cause each of its respective
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may
reasonably request. Neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would result in (i) the breach of any Contract with any Third Party
( _provided_ that such party will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of the Third Party to such disclosure), (ii) a waiver of
or a risk of loss of the attorney-

 



60  client or other privilege held by such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to such information, (iii) a Governmental Entity alleging that
providing such information violates any Antitrust Law, or (iv) the violation
of any Law. No review pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ will affect any
representation or warranty given by any party hereto. Each of the Company and
Parent will hold, and will cause its respective Affiliates, officers,
employees and Representatives to hold, any information provided or nonpublic
information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

5.3. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. (a) Except where a different standard
of efforts to be undertaken by the Company or Parent, as applicable, is
expressly set forth in another Section or provision of this Agreement, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts for (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities, including any required action or non-
action under the Antitrust Laws (the " _Required Consents_ ") prior to the
First Effective Time, and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain a Required
Consent from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity,
(ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from any
other Third Parties, (iii) the defending of any Action challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any Action seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated
or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, (ii) appropriate filings, if
any are required, pursuant to foreign Antitrust Laws as promptly as
practicable, and (iii) all other necessary filings with other Governmental
Entities relating to the Mergers, and, in each case, to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
formally or informally requested pursuant to the Antitrust Laws or by such
authorities and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws and
the receipt of the Required Consents as soon as practicable. Subject to
_Section 5.3(b)_, Parent and its Affiliates will take any and all action
reasonably necessary, including (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or
holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets,
categories of assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual
rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries, (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement, (iv)
creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of the Company
or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, or (v) effectuating any other
change or restructuring of the

 



61  Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case,
entering into agreements or stipulating to the entry of an Order or filing
appropriate applications with any Governmental Entity in connection with any
of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company
or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, by consenting to
such action by the Company (provided that any such action may, at the
discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the Mergers))
(each a " _Divestiture Action_ "), in each case to the extent necessary to
prevent the issuance of an Order or the establishment of any Law
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Mergers or to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals or
expiration of the waiting period under the HSR act by the Outside Date. In the
event that any permanent or preliminary Order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any Action that would make
consummation of the Mergers unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prevent the Mergers, Parent will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take promptly any and all steps reasonably available to it to
vacate, modify or suspend such Order so as to permit such consummation prior
to the Outside Date. The Company will cooperate with Parent and will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in resisting and
reducing any Divestiture Action and, without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent may be given or withheld by Parent in its sole
discretion), neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives
will propose or agree to any Divestiture Action.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will Parent
or any of its Affiliates be required to propose or agree to (or to consent to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries proposing or agreeing to) any
Divestiture Action that the Parent Board determines in good faith, After
Consultation, would, if such Divestiture Action were taken, have a materially
adverse effect on the aggregate net benefits (including synergies) expected to
be received by Parent arising from the Mergers.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party, hereto
in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. Each
of Parent and the Company will (i) promptly notify the other of any
communication received by that party from, or given by it to, any Governmental
Entity and, subject to Law, permit the other to review in advance any proposed
communication to any such Governmental Entity and incorporate the others
reasonable comments, (ii) not agree to participate in any meeting or
substantive discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Mergers
unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend, and (iii) furnish the other with
copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications between them
and their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and
Representatives, on one hand, and any such Governmental Entity or its
respective staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Mergers, except that materials furnished pursuant to this _Section 5.3(c)_
may be

 



62  redacted as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other
privilege or confidentiality concerns. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent will control and direct the antitrust defense of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any claim or Action by, or
negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or other Person.

 

5.4. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) From and for a period
of six years after the First Effective Time, Parent will indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the First Effective Time, a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the First Effective Time,
serving at the request of the Company, as applicable, or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim or Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the First Effective
Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party
is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director or officer of another Person or in respect of any acts
or omissions in their capacities as such directors or officers occurring
prior to the First Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the First Effective Time to the fullest extent permissible under
applicable Law and to the fullest extent as such Indemnified Parties are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the governing organizational documents
of any Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, and any indemnification
Contracts with directors and officers of the Company in existence as of the
date of this Agreement and listed in _Section 5.4(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. In the event of any such claim or Action, (i) each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred in the defense of any such claim or Action from
Parent to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law and to the
fullest extent as such Indemnified Parties are entitled to advance of such
expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the governing or organizational
documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, and any
indemnification Contracts with directors and officers of the Company in
existence as of the date of this Agreement and listed in _Section 5.4(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking, if and to the extent required by Law,
the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or the governing or organizational
documents of any the Company Subsidiary, as applicable, and
any indemnification Contracts with directors and officers of the Company in
existence as of the date of this Agreement and listed in _Section 5.4(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification, and (ii)
Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense of
any such matter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
5.4(a)_ or elsewhere in this

 



63  Agreement, Parent and Ultimate Surviving Corporation will not settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim or Action for which indemnification has
been sought under this _Section 5.4(a)_ unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such claim or Action and does not
include any admission of liability with respect to such Indemnified Party. In
the event that Parent, the First Surviving Corporation, the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, Parent, the First Surviving Corporation or
Ultimate Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will provide that the
successors and assigns of Parent, the First Surviving Corporation or Ultimate
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.4_.

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Closing Date, Parent will
either, at its election (i) cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii)
provide substitute polices for not less than the existing coverage provided by
the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by Parent in favor of the directors and officers
of Parent with respect to claims arising from, relating to, or otherwise in
respect of facts or events that occurred on or before the First Effective
Time, except, in each case, that in no event will Parent be required to pay
with respect to such insurance policies (or substitute insurance policies)
more than 275% of the annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance
for the year ending December 31, 2015 (the " _Annual D andO Cap_"), and if
Parent is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 5.4(b)_
for any year within such six-year period, it will obtain the most advantageous
insurance obtainable for such year for an annual premium not to exceed the
Annual DandO Cap;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in lieu of the foregoing, the
Company may obtain at or prior to the First Effective Time a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy under the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy providing substantially equivalent coverage to that
described in the preceding sentence. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been
obtained by the Company prior to the First Effective Time, Parent will cause
such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and
cause the Ultimate Surviving Corporation to honor all obligations thereunder.

 

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
5.4(a)_, upon learning of any such claim or Action, will promptly notify
Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify will not relieve Parent or the
Ultimate Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure prejudices the
indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim or Action (whether arising
before, at or after the First Effective Time): (i) Parent or the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation will have the right to assume the defense thereof and
Parent and the Ultimate Surviving Corporation will not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the 

 



64  Ultimate Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel
for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Parent or the Ultimate Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Ultimate Surviving Corporation will
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and the Ultimate Surviving Corporation will be obligated pursuant
to this _Section 5.4(c)_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such
Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest;
_provided_ , that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts
of interest will be used; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; and (iii) Parent and the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior
written consent; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation will not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction ultimately
determines, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.4_ (i) will survive consummation of the
Mergers, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified Parties), his
or her heirs and his or her Representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

5.5. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Except as provided below and as set forth in
_Section 5.13(f)_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Mergers, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Mergers are
consummated, except that (i) Parent and the Company will each bear and pay 50%
of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with (A) the filing, printing
and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement and (B) the filings
of the pre-merger notification and report forms under the HSR Act and other
Antitrust Laws (including filing fees) and (ii) if any Action is brought based
upon any partys breach of this Agreement, the prevailing party, as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal may be
taken, will be entitled to recover fees and expenses in connection with such
breach, including attorneys fees and costs from the other party to the
Action. 

(b) The Company will pay or cause to be paid to Parent a nonrefundable cash
fee equal to $385 million if: (i) the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ ( _Company Enters into Definitive Agreement
Providing for a Company Superior Proposal_ ); (ii) (A) Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ ( _Company Board Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ) or (B) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(i)_ ( _Lapse of Outside Date_ ) or _Section 7.1(b)(ii_) (
_Failure of Company to Obtain Stockholder Approval_ ) at a time when this
Agreement could have been terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_; or (iii)
(A) a

 



65  Company Alternative Proposal is made and publicly disclosed or announced
(substituting, for purposes of this _Section 5.5(b)_, "50%" for each
reference to "20%" in the definition of "Company Alternative Proposal") (a "
_Company Qualifying Transaction_ ") and not subsequently publicly withdrawn,
and thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(i)_ ( _Lapse of Outside Date_ ), _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ ( _Failure of
Company to Obtain Stockholder Approval_ ) or _Section 7.1(c)_ ( _Company
Breach_ ), and (B) within 12 months of such termination, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, a Company
Qualifying Transaction. Any fee due under this _Section 5.5(b)_ will be paid
to Parent by wire transfer to an account specified in _Section 5.5(b)_ of
the Parent Disclosure Letter of same-day funds on the date of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence, within two
Business Days after termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to clause
(ii) of the preceding sentence (in the case of a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in respect of a Company Intervening Event in accordance
with _Section 4.2(e)_), or on the earlier of the date of execution of such
definitive agreement or consummation of a Company Qualifying Transaction in
the case of termination of this Agreement pursuant to clause (iii) of the
preceding sentence. In no event will the Company be required to pay the fee
set forth in this  _Section 5.5(b)_ on more than one occasion.

(c) Parent will pay or cause to be paid to the Company a nonrefundable cash
fee equal to $385 million if: (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(g)_ ( _Parent Enters into Definitive Agreement Providing for
a Parent Superior Proposal_ ); (ii) (A) the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ ( _Parent Board Adverse Recommendation Change_ )
or (B) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ ( _Lapse

Stockholder Approval_ ) at a time when this Agreement could have been
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_; or (iii) (A) a Parent Alternative
Proposal is made and publicly disclosed or announced (substituting, for
purposes of this _Section 5.5(b)_, "50%" for each reference to "20%" in the
definition of "Parent Alternative Proposal") (a " _Parent Qualifying
Transaction_ ") and not subsequently publicly withdrawn, and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ ( _Lapse of Outside
Date_ ), _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ ( _Failure of Parent to Obtain Stockholder
Approval_ ) or  _Section 7.1(d)_ ( _Parent Breach_ ), and (B) within 12

this Agreement pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence. In no
event will Parent be required to pay the fee set forth in this _Section
5.5(c)_ on more than one occasion.

 

(d) If, in any circumstance not subject to _Section 5.5(f)_, either the

 



66  Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ (Failure of Company to Obtain Stockholder Approval) and the Parent
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, then within one Business Day after
such termination, the Company will pay or cause to be paid to Parent (by wire
transfer to the account specified in _Section 5.5(b)_ above) an amount equal
to the aggregate amount of all customary and documented fees, costs, and
expenses incurred, paid or payable by or on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Third Party in connection with the authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution, performance, termination or
abandonment of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including such customary and documented fees, costs and expenses of Third
Parties (including financial advisors, outside legal counsel, vendors,
accountants, experts, consultants and other service providers and
Representatives) (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), in an aggregate amount not to
exceed $100 million in cash. Parent Expenses paid by the Company pursuant to
this _Section 5.5(d)_ will not reduce any fee that otherwise may become due
and payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 5.5(b)_.

(e) If, in any circumstance not subject to  _Section 5.5(f)_, either the
Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_
( _Failure of Parent to Obtain Stockholder Approval_ ) and the Company

to the aggregate amount of all customary and documented fees, costs and
expenses incurred, paid or payable by or on behalf of the Company or any of

of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including such
customary and documented fees, costs and expenses of Third Parties (including
fees and expenses of financial advisors, outside legal counsel,
vendors, accountants, experts, consultants and other service providers and
Representatives) (the " _Company Expenses_ "), in an aggregate amount not to

this  _Section 5.5(e)_ will not reduce any fee that otherwise may become due
and payable by Parent pursuant to _Section 5.5(c)_ or _Section 5.5(f)_.

 

(f) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(i)_ ( _Termination Related to a Debt Rating Failure_ ) or (ii)
by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ ( _Lapse of Outside
Date_ ) and (A) at such time as this Agreement could have been terminated by
the Company or Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.1(i)_ and (B) all conditions
set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
which are capable of being satisfied), then within one Business Day after any
such termination, Parent will pay or cause to be paid to the Company (by wire
transfer to the account specified in _Section 5.5(b)_ above) a non-refundable
cash fee equal to $900 million, provided, however, that (1) in no event will
Parent be required to pay the fee set forth in this _Section 5.5(f)_ on more
than one occasion, (2) no fee will be due hereunder if this Agreement shall
have been terminated under any provision other than _Section 7.1(i)_ (
_Termination Related to a Debt Rating Failure_ ) or, in the

 



67 _ _ circumstances described in this _Section 5.5(f)_, _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ (
_Lapse of Outside Date_ ), and (3) any fee paid by Parent pursuant to 
_Section 5.5(c)_ will be credited against, and will thereby reduce, any fee
that otherwise may become due and payable by Parent pursuant to this _Section
5.5(f)_. __

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the proviso to this sentence, if this Agreement is terminated by
Parent and Parent has been paid in full a fee under _Section 5.5(b)_ or
reimbursed Parent Expenses under _Section 5.5(d)_, the payment to Parent of
such fee or Parent Expenses will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and its Related Persons against the Company or any of its Related Persons, and
upon full payment of such fee and Parent Expenses to Parent, Parent (on its
own behalf and on behalf of its Related Persons) hereby agrees that, upon
such payment and Parents acceptance thereof, Parent thereby shall have
waived all other remedies (including equitable remedies) against the Company
or any of its Related Persons with respect to (i) any failure of the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any breach, violation
or non-compliance by the Company of any of its obligations to consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby or of any

5.6. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release (the " _Transaction
Announcement_ ") with respect to the execution of this Agreement will be a
joint press release in substantially the form previously agreed to by Parent
and the Company. Except with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change made in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_ or Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change made in accordance with _Section 4.3(e)_, Parent,
Merger Sub and Successor Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, will consult with each other before publishing, and provide each other
the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or similar
public statements with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and will not publish any such press release before such
consultation, except to the extent required by Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing Contract with any national securities
exchange, as determined by a party in good faith, After Consultation. Subject
to the immediately preceding sentence, from the date hereof through the First
Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Company will, and neither will permit
any of its Affiliates or Representatives to, publish any press releases or

practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the
Closing Date.

 



69 5.8. _Certain Tax and Structure Matters_. (a) Each of the parties hereto will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify for
the Intended Tax Treatment, including considering and negotiating in good
faith such amendments to this Agreement as may reasonably be required in order
to obtain such qualification (it being understood that no party will be
required to agree to any such amendment). The parties will report the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, in a manner consistent with such qualification.
No party will take any action or fail to take any action, or allow any
Affiliate to take any action or fail to take any action, that would reasonably
be expected to prevent any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Tax opinions described in  _Section 6.2(e)_ and
_Section 6.3(e)_, respectively (collectively the " _Tax Opinions_ "). The
appropriate officers of Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub and the Company will
execute and deliver to Jones Day, counsel to Parent, and Greenberg Traurig,
LLP, counsel to the Company, certificates substantially in the forms set forth
in _Section 5.8(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter and _Section 5.8(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Representation Letters_ "). Each
Representation Letter will be dated on the or before the date of such Tax
Opinion and shall not have been withdrawn or modified in any material respect.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
before the First Effective Time, if and to the extent that Parent deems such
a change to be desirable, at Parents election (which may be made by delivery
of written notice to the Company at any time prior to filing any preliminary
Form S-4), the parties hereto will cooperate in good faith and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to amend this Agreement and, to the
extent necessary, modify the Representation Letters, in each case to change
the method of effecting the transactions contemplated hereby to reflect the
alternative structure set forth in _Section 5.8(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter so that the transactions contemplated hereby will qualify under Section
351 of the Code; _provided_ , that (i) any such change will not adversely
affect the U.S. federal income Tax consequences of the transactions
contemplated hereby to holders of Shares and (ii) no such change will (A)
alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to
holders of Shares as consideration in the Mergers or (B) materially impede or
delay consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of
the previous sentence, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents, and
make appropriate amendments to existing documents, to reflect any change in
the structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.9. _Takeover Statutes_. Parent and Company will take all action necessary
to ensure that the restrictions on business combinations contained in Section
203 of the DGCL nor any other "business combination," "interested
stockholder," "freeze out," "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"moratorium," or other anti-takeover Laws (collectively with Section 203 of
the DGCL, _"Anti-Takeover Laws_ ") are or become applicable to this Agreement
or the Mergers. If any Anti-Takeover Law is or may become applicable to the
Mergers or any other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties
hereto and their respective board of directors will (a) grant such approvals 

 



70  and take all such actions as are legally permissible so that the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Anti-Takeover Law on the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.10. _Employee Benefits_. (a) For the period commencing as of the First
Effective Time and ending December 31, 2016, Parent will provide, or cause to
be provided, to each Company Employee who is employed by Parent and its
Subsidiaries, compensation and benefits (except those provided by any equity
based Company Benefit Plans or arrangements of Company) that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and
benefits provided to each such Company Employee prior to the First Effective
Time, or, at Parents option, Parent will provide, or cause to be provided, to
each such Company Employee compensation and benefits substantially similar to
the level of compensation and benefits provided to employees of Parent and its
subsidiaries working in a substantially similar positions. This _Section
5.10(a)_ will not apply to collectively bargained employees whether or not
they are Company Employees, the terms and conditions of whose employment will
be determined by the applicable collective bargaining Contract assumed by or
required to be assumed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries as in effect from
time-to-time.

(b) From and after the First Effective Time, Parent will cause to be honored
all Company Benefit Plans (except those provided by any equity based Company
Benefit Plans or arrangements) in accordance with the terms thereof. For all
purposes under each employee benefit plan of Parent and its Subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Company Employee after the First Effective Time
(the " _New Plans_ "), and subject to Law and obligations under applicable
collective bargaining or similar Contracts, each Company Employee will be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, as the case may be, before the First Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the First
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any Company Benefit Plan of
the same type, as applicable, except to the extent such credit would result in
a duplication of benefits, except that Company Employees will not be entitled
to the benefit of any grandfathered benefit formula or to participation in
any benefit plan or arrangement provided by Parent, its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates that would not be provided to any employee first hired by Parent or
one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on or after the First Effective Time. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
to Law and obligations under applicable collective bargaining or similar
Contracts: (i) each Company Employee will be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans which are
welfare benefit plans, but only to the extent coverage under such New Plan
replaces coverage under a Company Benefit Plan of the same type, as
applicable, in which such employee participated immediately before the First
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent will cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent will
cause any

 



71  eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Nothing contained in this  _Section 5.10_ will (i) be construed to
establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any benefit or
compensation plan, program, Contract, policy or arrangement of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) limit the ability of Parent or the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or
compensation plan, program, Contract, policy or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, (iii) create
any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person (including but
not limited to any Company Employee or former employee of Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates) other than the parties to this Agreement or
any right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or
condition of employment with Parent or the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, or (iv) limit the right
of Parent or the Company (or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates) to
terminate the employment or service of any employee or other service provider
thereof following the First Effective Time at any time and for any or no
reason.

 

5.11. _Board of Directors of Parent_. Parent will use its commercially
reasonable efforts, and take all necessary actions, to cause the individuals
identified in _Section 5.11_ of the Company Disclosure Letter to become
members of the Parent Board effective as of immediately after the First
Effective Time, each to serve on the Parent Board until his or her successor
is duly elected and qualified in accordance with the Parent Charter and
Parent Bylaws.

5.12. _Section 16(b)_. Parent and the Company will each take all such steps
as may be reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company
(including derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of
Parent (including derivative securities) in connection herewith by any
individual who (a) is a director or officer of the Company or (b) at the First
Effective Time, will become a director or officer of Parent, in each case to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

5.13. _Financing_. (a) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing, on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters, on or prior to
the Closing Date which, together with cash on hand, will be sufficient for
Parent to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and any other cash amounts
payable pursuant to, or in connection with, the Mergers, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into, on or prior to the
Closing Date, the Financing Agreements (and, unless such Financing Agreements

in any event not later than one Business Day) of the execution of any such
Financing Agreement and provide execution copies thereof to the Company upon
the reasonable request of the Company), (ii) terminate or amend its Existing
Credit Facilities and any other existing debt or financing arrangements to the
extent required to satisfy the conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letters, (iii) maintain in full force and effect the Debt Commitment Letters

if deemed advisable by Parent, seek a waiver of) on a timely basis all
conditions in the Financing Agreements within the control of Parent and
required to be satisfied by it, and (v) consummate the Financing at or prior

the Company informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
and to satisfy the conditions thereof, including advising and updating the
Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to any material
developments concerning the status of the Financing and the proposed funding
date thereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 5.13_ or
in any other provision of this Agreement, in no event will Parent, Merger Sub
or Successor Sub be required to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions
hereof. Parent will segregate any and all funds obtained which reduce the
aggregate commitments under the Debt Commitment Letters in a special account
separated from the Parent other funds, and will use those segregated funds
solely to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and any other cash amounts
payable pursuant to, or in connection with, the Mergers.

 

(b) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to

Inc. (" _Fitch_ ") and Baa3 or higher by Moodys Investor Service Inc. ("
_Moody s_"), including making all necessary filings and taking all steps as
may be necessary to obtain such ratings as promptly as practicable, supplying
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be formally or informally requested by either SandP, Fitch or Moodys,
seeking to amend and/or restructure, as necessary, any and all of its
existing debt or the terms of the Financing, or any Alternative Financing
(subject, in each case, to provisions of _Section 5.13(c)_ below regarding
the Companys prior written consent), and to use good faith efforts to cause
the commencement and completion of any necessary Debt Offers. Parent will
promptly deliver a copy to the Company of any notice from SandP, Fitch or
Moodys no later than one Business Day after such notice is received by the
Parent or any of its Affiliates.

(c) Parent will not agree to, permit or consent to any termination,
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of
its rights under, the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing without the Companys prior written consent (which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_
that Parent may, without the Companys prior written consent, (i) enter into
any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of
any provision of the Debt Commitment

 



73  Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, if such
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver (A) does
not reduce the aggregate cash amount of proceeds of the Financing, (B) does
not change the timing of the funding of the Financing thereunder and would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the consummation of all or a
portion of the Financing or the Closing, (C) does not adversely change or
impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand or adversely amend any
of the Financing Conditions from those set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters on the date of this Agreement, (D) does not otherwise make the timely

the Financing less likely to occur, and (E) materially and adversely impact
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any other party to any
Debt Commitment Letters (clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E), collectively,
the " _Prohibited Commitment Letter Amendments_ ") and (ii) amend, replace
supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders,
lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had
not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement, but
only if the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the
aggregate, would not result in the occurrence of a Prohibited Commitment
Letter Amendment. Parent will not permit or consent to any waiver of any
remedy under the Debt Commitment Letters or to any early termination of the
Debt Commitment Letters. Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification, the term "Debt Commitment Letters" means the Debt Commitment
Letters as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified. Parent will
promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letters.

(d) Parent will promptly (and, in any event, within three Business Days)
notify the Company in writing (i) of its Knowledge of any breach or default by
any party to the Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive financing agreement
entered into in connection with the Financing, if such breach or default
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the timely availability of,
or the amount of, the Financing, (ii) if and when Parent becomes aware that
any portion of the Financing contemplated by any Debt Commitment Letter will
not be available to consummate the Closing, (iii) if for any reason Parent or
any of its Affiliates believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain any portion of the Financing (x) subject to the
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, (y) in an amount that
is sufficient to consummate the Closing or (z) within the timing contemplated
hereby or by the Debt Commitment letters, and (iv) of the receipt by any of
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives of any
written notice from any Financing Source, lender or any other Person with
respect to any (A) actual, threatened or alleged breach, default, termination
or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive
financing agreement entered into in connection with the Financing or any
provision of the Financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letters or any definitive financing agreement entered into in connection with
the Financing (including any proposal by any Financing Source, lender or other
Person to withdraw, terminate or make a material change in the terms of
(including the amount of Financing contemplated by) the Debt Commitment
Letters that would reasonably be expected to affect the timely availability
of, or the amount of, such Financing) or (B) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the

 



74  Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive financing agreement entered into
in connection with the Financing, if such dispute or disagreement would
reasonably be expected to affect the timely availability of, or amount of,
the Financing. In the event that all conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements have been satisfied, Parent
will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Source to comply with
its funding obligations thereunder. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in
any event within two Business Days after the Company delivers to Parent a
written request, Parent will provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in this
_5.13(c)_.

Approval) and the stockholders of Parent (in the case of the Parent
Stockholder Approval), any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount
or the form of the consideration to be delivered to the holders of Common
Stock hereunder or that by Law otherwise expressly requires the further
approval of the stockholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, as
the case may be, (b) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement
will be submitted to be approved by the stockholders of the Company or the
stockholders of Parent unless required by Law, and (c) this _Section 7.3_,

instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Any extension or
waiver given in compliance with this _Section 7.4_ or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

8.4. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference will be to an Article or Section
of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not
exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase will not mean simply
"if." All terms defined in this Agreement will have the defined meanings when
used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.
Any Contract defined or referred to herein or in any Contract that is
referred to herein means such Contract as from time to time amended, modified
or supplemented, including by waiver or consent, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. References to statutes will include all regulations promulgated
thereunder and references to statutes or regulations will be construed as
including all statutory and regulatory provisions consolidating, amending or
replacing the statue or regulation, including by succession of comparable
successor statutes. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all
references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money
of the United States of America. Whenever a consent or approval of the
Company or Parent is required under this Agreement, such consent or approval
may be executed and delivered only by an executive officer of such party. All
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in
nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth herein.
Any document, list or other item shall be deemed to have been "made available"
to Parent or the Company, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement
if such document, list or other item was posted in the electronic data

 



104  room established by the Company or Parent, as applicable, in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, or was set forth in a Company Filed SEC
Document or Parent Filed SEC Document, as applicable, or a physical or
electronic copy thereof was delivered or otherwise made available to the
Company or Parent, as applicable, or their respective Representatives.
Wherever in this Agreement reference is made to any determination of
the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, or reference is made to
any action required to be made or taken by the Company or Parent pursuant to
this Agreement through the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable,
such references shall be deemed to further state and require (if not already
expressly contained in such references) that such determination and/or action
required to be made or taken by the Company Board or the Parent Board, as
applicable, pursuant to this Agreement will be made and taken in good faith,
After Consultation.

8.5. _Counterparts; .pdf Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement
and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties. This Agreement
may be executed by.pdf signature and a .pdf signature will constitute an
original for all purposes.

8.6. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Additional
Representations_. (a) This Agreement (including the documents, Exhibits and
instruments referred to herein), taken together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter,
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect
to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
This Agreement, including the documents, Exhibits and other instruments
referred to herein, are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the
parties rights or remedies, except for (i) _Section 5.4_, which will inure
to the benefit of the Indemnified Parties and the other Persons benefiting
therefrom who are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof
and who may enforce the covenants contained therein, and (ii) _Section 7.3_,
this  _Section 8.6(a)_, _Section 8.9_, _Section 8.10(b)_ and _Section
8.13_, which will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, all of
whom are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and with
respect to their rights thereunder.

(b) The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the Mergers exclusively in Contract
pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement and the parties
hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to
any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, the
parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable
expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arms-length negotiations.
All parties to this Agreement specifically acknowledge that no party has any
special relationship with another party that would justify any expectation
beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arms-length
transaction. The sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set
forth herein, made in 

 



105  connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) or any
claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related to the
acquisition of the Company or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or this Agreement will be those remedies available at law or in
equity for breach of contract only (as such contractual remedies have been
further expanded, limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms of this
Agreement). The parties hereby agree that no party hereto will have any remedy
or cause of action (whether in contract or in tort) for any statements,
communications, disclosures, failures to disclose, representations or
warranties not set forth in this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree
that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, none of the Company,
Parent or any other Person has made any representation or warranty, expressed
or implied, as to the respective businesses of the Company and Parent, or the
accuracy or completeness of any information regarding such businesses
furnished or made available to the parties.

 

8.7. _GOVERNING LAW_ ; THIS AGREEMENT, AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION
(WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF
OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF
THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR AS AN INDUCEMENT OR CONDITION TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT), WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL
SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO
AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE, BUT WITHOUT
REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE.

8.8. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement will be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the Company and Parent. Any purported assignment in
violation of the preceding sentence will be void. Subject to the preceding two
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

8.9. _Specific Enforcement_. Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this
Agreement, express or implied, the parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties to
this Agreement will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court referred to in _Section 8.10_, without proof of actual
damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific

 



106  enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for
any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (including this _Section 8.9_), the parties
acknowledge and agree that, in the event of a Debt Rating Failure, the Company
will not have the right to specific performance or other equitable remedies
to enforce Parents, Merger Subs or Successor Subs obligation to proceed to
the Closing (but only if Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub shall have
complied in all material respects with its covenants, agreements and
obligations set forth in _Section 5.13_). For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event the Parent shall fail to obtain Financing (other than as a result of a
Debt Rating Failure), the Company shall have the right to specific performance
or other equitable remedies to enforce Parents, Merger Subs or Successor
Subs obligation to proceed to the Closing. To the extent any party hereto
brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement when available to such party pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Outside Date will automatically be extended by
the amount of time during which such action is pending, plus 20 Business Days,
or (such other time period established by the court presiding over such
Action.)

8.10. _Venue; Waiver of Trial by Jury_. (a) Each of the parties hereto (i)
irrevocably submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of all state and
federal courts in the State of Delaware, including to the jurisdiction of all
courts to which an appeal may be taken from such courts, in any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Mergers, or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any facts and circumstances
leading to its execution or performance, (ii) agrees that all claims in
respect of any such proceeding must be brought, heard and determined
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (provided that,
in the event subject matter jurisdiction is declined by or unavailable in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then such dispute will be heard
and determined exclusively in any other state or federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware), (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iv) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any other court and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of any proceeding so brought. The parties agree that a
final judgment in any such dispute will be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law. Each of the parties agrees to waive any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other party with respect to any such
dispute, including any appeal thereof.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 8.10(a)_ and without limiting
the provisions of _Section 8.13_, the Company (i) agrees that it will not,
and will not permit its Affiliates to, bring or support any Action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity and whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources in any way related to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any dispute arising
out of or relating to the Financing or the performance thereof) in any
forum other than the United States District Court for the Southern District

 



107  of New York or the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County,
located in the Borough of Manhattan or, in either case, any appellate court
thereof, (ii) agrees that any such Action will be governed by the laws of the
State of New York, (iii) agrees to waive and hereby waives, irrevocably and
unconditionally, any right to a trial by jury in any such Action and (iv)
agrees to waive and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any
such Action in any such court.

 

(c) Each of the parties agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document in accordance with _Section 8.2_ ( _Notices_ ) will be effective
service of process for any proceeding brought against it by the other party in
connection with _Section 8.10(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained herein will affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the consents to jurisdiction set forth in this _Section 8.10(c)_ will not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and will have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this _Section
8.10(c)_ and will not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the
parties.

 

(d) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS OR THE FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES
LEADING TO ITS EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO PARTY OR REPRESENTATIVE OR AFFILIATE THEREOF HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
CONTAINED IN THIS PARAGRAPH.

 

8.11. _Headings, etc_. The headings and table of contents contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

8.12. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party or

 



108  such party waives its rights under this _Section 8.12_ with respect
thereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

8.13. _Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to
