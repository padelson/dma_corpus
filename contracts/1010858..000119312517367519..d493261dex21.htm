conveyance, assignment, assumption, transfer or delivery, without the consent of a third party would (i)&nbsp;constitute a breach or other contravention of any Applicable Law or the rights of such third party, (ii)&nbsp;be ineffective with respect
to any party to a Contract concerning such Transferred Asset or (iii)&nbsp;upon transfer, in any way adversely affect the rights of the Transferee under such Transferred Asset. If the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery by the
Transferor to the Transferee of any interest in, or assumption by the Transferee of any liabilities or obligations under, any Transferred Asset requires the consent of a third party, or, with respect to Transferred Contracts, a novation approved by
the relevant Governmental Authority or consent of the Contract counterparty, then such sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer, delivery or assumption will be subject to such consent or novation being obtained. Without limiting

continue to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent as promptly as practicable after the Closing until such time as such consent has been obtained and to cooperate in any lawful and reasonable arrangement which will provide
the Transferee the benefits including any indemnities of any such Transferred Asset. Once a consent for the sale, conveyance, assignment, assumption, transfer and delivery of an Transferred Asset is obtained, the Transferor will promptly assign,
transfer, convey and deliver such Transferred Asset to the Transferee, and the Transferee will assume the obligations under such Transferred Asset assigned to it from and after the date of assignment to the Transferee. If and when such consents are

indemnified party to give notice will not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Section&nbsp;12, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. The indemnifying party

monetary settlement is paid by the indemnifying party, and (iii)&nbsp;the indemnified party receives as part of such settlement a legal, binding and enforceable unconditional release providing that such third party claim and any claimed liability of
the indemnified party with respect to the third party claim is fully satisfied by reason of such settlement and that the indemnified party is being released from any and all obligations and liabilities it may have with respect to the third party
