employment. Further, all vested Converted Stock Options will remain

Cause, or, if earlier, until the original expiration date of the Converted
Stock Option.

to the extent any such Converted RSU Award is subject to Section 409A of the
Code, such payment shall be made in accordance with the applicable awards
terms and at the earliest time permitted that will not result in the
application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

2016 PSU Awards, the Earned 2016 PSU Award and (y) for 2017 PSU Awards, the

as Parent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock and that amount of cash (including cash in lieu
of fractional shares as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_) that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE III_ ,
and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in
the name of, or paid to, a person other than the person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall
be a condition to the registration or payment (as applicable) of such Merger
Consideration that the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such registration in
the name of a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 13 _ 3.2_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.  
---|---|--- 



   (c) | Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to any shares
of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 3.2(e)_, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in accordance with this _ARTICLE III_. Subject to Applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall
be paid to the holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_, (ii) at the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (iii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock. 
---|--- 



   (d) | No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares
of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_ARTICLE III_ (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_)
shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock, theretofore
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this  _ARTICLE III_ , except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law. 
---|--- 



   (e) | Fractional Shares. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to such
fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent
Common Stock. 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 14 each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) (each a _Fractional Stockholder_ ) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash (in a US dollar amount), without interest, in an amount
equal to such fraction as determined below. As promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of
(i) the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange
Agent by Parent for issuance to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
over (ii) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be
distributed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (such excess, the
_Excess Shares_ ). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the
Exchange, all in the manner provided herein. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall
be executed on the Exchange and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been
distributed to the Fractional Stockholders, the Exchange Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for such Fractional Stockholders. The net proceeds of
any such sale or sales of Excess Shares to be distributed to the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be reduced by any and all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well
as any expenses, of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale
or sales. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds
to which each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled,
if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by
a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled
(after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by
such holder) and (B) the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent
shall promptly pay such amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance
with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_, Parent may
elect, at its option exercised prior to the Effective Time, to pay the
Exchange Agent an amount in cash in US dollars, to be deposited on the first 

---|---|--- 
 



Page 15 Exchange Agent to pay each holder of Certificates or Book Entry Shares an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would have otherwise
been entitled by (B) the closing price for a single share of Parent Common
Stock on the Exchange on the first Business Day immediately following the
Effective Time. In such event, all references in this Agreement to the net
proceeds from the sale of Excess Shares and similar references shall be deemed
to refer to the payment executed in the manner set forth in this  _Section_
__ _ 3.2(e)(iv)_. 
---|--- 



   (f) | Return of Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.2(a)_ that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter be
entitled to look only to Parent for payment of their claim for any shares of
Parent Common Stock, any cash (including cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock) and any dividends or distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock. 
---|--- 



   (g) | No Liability. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered
prior to seven years after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share would otherwise escheat to, or be required to come into the
custody of, any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto. 
---|--- 



   (h) | Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with
the relevant Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. 
---|--- 
 



Page 16 stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent, as applicable,
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 3.3 Effect of the Second Merger

 

As of the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without
any action on the part of any of the parties, or the holders of any shares
of Company Common Stock, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be
automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company and its Subsidiaries included in the Company SEC
Documents (the _Company Financial Statements_ ) were prepared in all material

to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance

Section 5.2 No Solicitation by the Company



   (a) |

The Company shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates and each of
its and their respective officers, directors, employees not to, and shall
direct its investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives retained by it or any of its controlled Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or knowingly
take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the
making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Company
Alternative Transaction, or (ii) engage or participate in any substantive
discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way with any person (or group
of persons), with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any
proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Company Alternative
Transaction, except to notify such person (or group of persons) as to the
existence of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, (iii) grant
any waiver or release under (1) any standstill provision in any Contract to 

---|--- 
 



Page 69 provision in any Contract to which the Company is a party other than, with
respect to this clause (2), any waiver or release under a confidentiality
provision in any agreement entered into by the Company which is not related
to, or in contemplation of, a Company Alternative Transaction (except, in the
case of this clause (iii), if the failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
of the Company under Applicable Law), or (iv) resolve, publicly propose or
agree to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that (X) the Company and
its officers, directors, managers, employees, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants and other representatives (each a
_Representative_ ) may contact such person (or group of persons) for the
purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions of any such proposal and (Y)
if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that any proposal which contemplates a Company Alternative Transaction did not
result from a material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ and constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal,
subject to compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.2(e)_, the Company and its
Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons) making such proposal
(and its Representatives and financing sources) (provided that all such
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such
person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms as
to confidentiality (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement
need not include any "standstill" terms, but shall not prohibit the Company
from providing information to Parent as provided above) generally no less
restrictive than the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated February
27, 2017, as amended, entered into between the Company and Parent (the
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ), and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such proposal with the person (or group of persons)
making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources).  
---|--- 

For purposes of this Agreement, _Company Alternative Transaction_ means any of
(i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or
group of persons) other than Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub
and Merger Sub LLC) (such person (or group of persons), a _Company Third
Party_ ), acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial
ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 20%
of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting
power of the Company, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer
or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange
or similar transaction pursuant to which any Company Third Party acquires or
would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income
or assets (in each case on a

 



Page 70  consolidated basis) of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
(iii) any transaction pursuant to which any Company Third Party acquires or
would acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for this
purpose the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of the Company and
any entity surviving any merger or combination including any of them) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the revenues,
net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (iv) any disposition of assets to a
Company Third Party representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or
assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



   (b) | Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _
5.2(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_, neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fail to make, including in
the Proxy Statement, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval
or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger
or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve
or recommend, any Company Alternative Transaction (any action in _clause (i)_
or this _clause (ii)_ being referred to as a _Company Recommendation Change_
), or (iii) cause the Company or any of its Affiliates to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
agreement related to any Company Alternative Transaction. 
---|--- 



   (c) |

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after it has received a Company Superior Proposal
(and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation), that the failure to do so would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to
compliance with this and the following sentences) effect a Company
Recommendation Change and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_ and concurrently with such termination
enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Company Superior
Proposal, but only at a time that is after the fifth (5th) Business Day
following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent
that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Company Superior
Proposal specifying the material terms and conditions of such Company
Superior Proposal, identifying the person making such Company Superior
Proposal and stating that it intends to make a Company Recommendation Change
and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_; provided
that in the event of a subsequent modification to the material terms and
conditions of such Company Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the
Company may only effect a Company Recommendation Change and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_ after the third (3rd) Business
Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising
Parent of the modification to such terms and conditions; and provided further
that during the foregoing notice periods, as applicable, the Company engages
(to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith  

---|--- 
 



Page 71 manner that the proposal to enter into a Company Alternative Transaction no
longer constitutes a Company Superior Proposal.  
---|--- 

For purposes of this Agreement, a _Company Superior Proposal_ means any bona
fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if
amended or modified) made by a Company Third Party to enter into a Company
Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition of
Company Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these
purposes) that (A) did not result from a material breach of _Section_ __ _
5.2(a)_, and (B) is on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to
the Companys stockholders to the Transactions, taking into account all
relevant factors (including any changes to this Agreement that may be
proposed by Parent in response to such proposal to enter into a Company
Alternative Transaction, and the relative likelihood that such Company
Alternative Transaction would be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal).



   (d) | In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company
Recommendation Change in response to any Effect that materially affects (A)
the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the stockholders of the Company
(including the benefits of the Transactions to the Company or the stockholders
of the Company), in either case that (x) is first occurring after the date
hereof, (y) does not involve or relate to a proposal the consummation of
which would constitute a Company Alternative Transaction, and (z) is not known
and was not reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors of the Company as
of the date hereof, but only at a time that is after the third business day
following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent
of all material information with respect to any such Effect and stating that
it intends to make a Company Recommendation Change and providing a
full description of its rationale therefor. 
---|--- 



   (e) |

In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.2(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, the Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, advise Parent in writing of any
request for information or of any proposal relating to a Company Alternative
Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such
request or proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any
such request or proposal on a reasonably current 

---|--- 
 



Page 72 practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written materials exchanged between the Company or its Subsidiaries or
any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any person making such
request or proposal, on the other hand, in each case to the extent that such
correspondence or other written materials describes in any material
respect any of the material terms or conditions of any such request or
proposal (including any material change to any material term). 
---|--- 



   (f) | Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure
of its position thereunder; provided, however, that any such disclosure or
statement that constitutes or contains a Company Recommendation Change shall
be subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ (it being understood,
for the avoidance of doubt, that a disclosure that constitutes only a "stop,
look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a Company
Recommendation Change).

and with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any
other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including
by incorporation by reference) to the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement shall be made without the approval of both Parent and the Company,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided that this right of approval shall not apply with respect to documents

Effective Time any information relating to the Company, Sibelco, Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company, Sibelco or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, so that any part of
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 
---|--- 



   (d) | The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy

DGCL for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and shall
subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, through its Board of
Directors, recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement.

_Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, the Companys obligation to give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 6.2_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making,
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Company

consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely to be required
under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of the Company prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting; provided, however, that the Company shall postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting once up to the earlier of (a) twenty
(20) days or (b) the date that is the latest date legally permissible under
Applicable Law without having to set a different record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting upon the request of Parent if necessary to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval.

Section 6.3 Financing; Financing Cooperation.



   (a) | Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent
will not permit any amendment or modification to, or any termination,
rescission or withdrawal of, or any material waiver of any provision or remedy
under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto (such definitive agreements related to the Financing, collectively,
with the Debt Commitment Letter, the _Definitive Agreement_ ) or the fee
letter referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter, if such amendment,
modification or waiver (individually or in the aggregate with any other
amendments, modifications or waivers) would reasonably be expected to (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing under any Definitive Agreement
below the amount required to consummate the Transactions (including by
changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount thereof), or
(ii) impose any new or additional condition, or otherwise amend, modify or
expand any condition, to the receipt of any portion of the Financing in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing,
(B) make the funding of any portion of the Financing (or satisfaction of any
condition to obtaining any portion of the Financing) less likely to occur, (C)
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any other
party to any Definitive Agreement or (D) adversely impact the ability
of Parent to consummate the Transactions or the likelihood of the
consummation of the Transactions. In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall
not release or consent to the termination of the Debt Commitment Letter except
for (x) assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the terms
of the syndication of the Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter, or (y)
replacements of the Debt Commitment Letter with alternative financing
commitments pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_. 
---|--- 



   (b) |

Parent shall use (or cause its Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best
efforts to take all actions and do, or cause to be done, as promptly as
possible, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Financing
and obtain the financing contemplated thereby on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, to the extent required, the
exercise of any flex provisions), including using its reasonable best efforts
to (i) maintain in effect the 

---|--- 
 



Page 75 subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) comply with its obligations under the
Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or on other terms that are (A)
acceptable to the Lenders and (B) in the aggregate not materially less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis (or
obtain a waiver to) all conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent
and its Subsidiaries in the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, (vi)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (vii) cause the
Lenders to fund the Financing at the Closing. Parent will fully pay, or cause
to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter as and when they become due. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Financing
becomes (or would reasonably be expected to become) unavailable on the terms
and conditions (including the flex provisions) set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event, (1)
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions
not less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter and in an amount at least equal to the Financing or
such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the _Alternate
Financing_ ), and (2) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters
with respect to such Alternate Financing (the _New Debt Commitment Letters_ ),
which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment
Letter in whole or in part. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a
copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any redacted fee letter in
connection therewith). In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are
obtained, (x) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter"
will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not
superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, and (y) any reference
in this Agreement to the "Financing" means the debt financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to the foregoing. 
---|--- 
 



   (c) |

Parent shall (i) keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing, and (ii) provide
the Company with copies of all executed definitive agreements related to the
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
promptly notify the Company (A) of any material breach or default by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the
Financing, or (B) of the receipt by Parent of any written notice or
communication from any Lender with respect to any (1) breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements, (2) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt 

---|--- 
 



Page 76 Financing but only to the extent that the Parent believes in good faith that
(X) it will not be able to obtain any portion of the Financing as a result of
such dispute or disagreement or (Y) the Closing could reasonably be expected
to be delayed or prevented as a result of such dispute or disagreement, (3) if
and when Parent becomes aware that any portion of the Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter may not be available, (4) if for any reason
Parent believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain any portion
of the Financing on the terms, in the manner and from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any related
flex terms) and (5) of any expiration or termination of the Debt Commitment
Letter or other Definitive Agreement; provided that any information disclosed
in such notice shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. 
---|--- 



   (d) | Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their respective
reasonable best efforts, to provide, to the extent within its control, Parent
(at Parents sole expense) with all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent
to assist it in causing the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter to be
satisfied or as is otherwise necessary for the arrangement and consummation of
the Financing and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Financing (provided that such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including using
its reasonable best efforts to: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | participate (and using reasonable best efforts to cause
senior management and Representatives, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, of the Company, to participate) in a reasonable and limited number
of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, sessions with
prospective financing sources, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies, and otherwise cooperating with the marketing efforts for any of the
Financing; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | promptly (x) provide Parent and the Lenders with the
Required Information; provided that the filing of the required financial
statements on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q within the time periods set forth in
Required Information by the Company will satisfy the requirements of this
clause with respect to annual and quarterly financials, and (y) assist Parent
and the Lenders (i) with the timely preparation of customary rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda, marketing materials and similar

officers, employees and Representatives of such other party, reasonable
access, during normal business hours during the period from the date of this

during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party
all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
other party may reasonably request (including in respect of developments in
relation to key employees and material financial developments); provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not require the Company and Parent to
disclose any information pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ to the extent
that (i) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such party, any Applicable
Law requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to
any such information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such
party, the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third
party or (iii) disclosure of any such information or document would result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege; provided, further, that with respect

or Parent or Sibelco, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(1) obtain the required consent of any third party necessary to provide such
disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to
address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to the Company or Parent
and (3) in the case of  _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ , utilize the
procedures of a joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques if
the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of
such information without violating Applicable Law or jeopardizing such
privilege. No review pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall affect any
representation or warranty given by the other party hereto. Each of the
Company and Parent shall hold, and shall cause its respective Affiliates,

anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the other parties to this Agreement (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no party to this Agreement
shall have any right to perform environmental or other invasive or subsurface
samples, tests or investigations of the properties or facilities of the other

obtained from, or renewed with third parties, (iv) the obtaining of all

to obtain any of the consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations referenced in clauses (ii) or (iv) above (other than any
consents, approvals or events required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_)
shall not constitute the failure to satisfy a condition to the obligation of
either party to consummate the Transactions, (v) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement, (vi) refraining from taking
any action that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with,

there has been a Company Recommendation Change made in compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ (in the case of the Companys obligation to use its
reasonable best efforts), obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval;

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC and Sibelco agrees to (i) make an

applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws and the receipt of the
Required Consents as soon as practicable. Each of the parties agrees that the
use of "reasonable best efforts" in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall
include proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing,

arrangements of the Company, Sibelco, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
in any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or materially delaying the consummation of the Transactions; provided,
however, that the effectiveness of any such sale, divestiture, licensing or
disposition shall be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger. In addition,
Sibelco, Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any
party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order
of any Governmental Entity (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would prevent the consummation of the Closing. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the obligations of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ nor any other provision in this Agreement shall
require the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
collectively, to agree to or effect a Material Divestiture.

   (c) | The parties shall jointly develop, and each of the parties shall
consult and cooperate in all respects with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with the form and content

in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to
their submission, provided that Parent shall have, after prior, good faith
consultation with the Company and after considering, in good faith, the
Companys views and comments, principal responsibility for determining the
strategy relating to any antitrust review by a Governmental Entity. Each of
the Company, on the one hand, and Sibelco, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub
LLC, on the other hand, shall (i) promptly notify the other party of any
communication, inquiry or investigation received by that party from, or given
by it to, any Governmental Entity and, subject to Applicable Law, permit the
other party to review in advance any proposed communication to any such
Governmental Entity and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments,
(ii) not agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any such
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Transactions unless, to the extent
reasonably practicable, it consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate therein and (iii) promptly furnish the
other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and written
communications between them and their Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees and Representatives, on one hand, and any such
Governmental Entity or its respective staff on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement and the Transactions in order for such other party to
meaningfully consult and participate in accordance with the preceding _clauses
(i)_ and _(ii)_ , provided that materials furnished pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_ may be shared on an outside-counsel-only basis to

obtained for an amount that, on an annual basis, does not exceed the Maximum
Amount.

expressed or implied, as to the respective businesses of the Company and

---|--- 

Section 9.7 Governing Law

 

This Agreement and all Actions (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of the
Company, Sibelco, Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub LLC in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, actions that may be
based upon, arise out of or related to the Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Agreements, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of any documentation related thereto, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

Section 9.8 Assignment

 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law
or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the
other parties; provided that, nothing in this Agreement shall or is intended
to limit the ability, after the Closing, of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates to assign its rights or delegate its
responsibilities, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement, in whole
or in part, without the consent of the other parties hereto, to the Lender
Related Parties as security 

 



Page 113  for borrowings and other obligations in connection with the Financing. Any
purported assignment in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void.
Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

Section 9.9 Specific Enforcement; Damages.



   (a) | The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and (as an
integral and essential part of the Transactions without which the parties
would not have entered into this Agreement) to enforce specifically the
performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to
in _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ below, without proof of actual damages (and each
party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity; provided, however, that, except
as expressly provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.9(c)_, the Company shall not be
entitled to specifically enforce Sibelcos, Parents, Merger Sub or Merger
Subs LLCs obligation, as applicable, to effect the Closing or the Merger or
pay or issue the Merger Consideration. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.9(c)_, the
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any such breach. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties may pursue both a
grant of specific performance to the extent permitted by this _Section_ __ _
9.9_ and the payment of damages as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(ii)_
and _Section_ __ _ 8.2(h)_, but may not collect more than one such remedy.  
---|--- 



   (b) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company
agrees that it may only pursue a grant of specific performance (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, will not seek any monetary award) against Sibelco in
respect of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
such limitation shall not apply with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries. 
---|--- 



   (c) |

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is acknowledged
and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to specifically enforce the
obligation of Sibelco, Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Subs LLC, as applicable,
to effect the Closing and the Merger and to pay or issue the Merger
Consideration on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement only if
(i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _
7.2_ have been satisfied or waived by the party entitled to waive (other than
those conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until Closing but
which are fully capable of being satisfied at Closing), (ii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that the Company is ready,
willing and able to consummate the Merger and that if 

---|--- 
 



Page 114 any alternative debt financing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.3_) is
funded and the Parent complies with its obligations to effect the Closing
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the Closing will occur, (iii)
the Financing (including any alternative debt financing in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_) has been funded, and (iv) Parent fails to consummate
the Closing by the date the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.2_. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitle to receive both (1) such grant of specific
performance to require the Parent or Sibelco to effect the Closing or the
Merger or to pay or issue the Merger Consideration and (2) payment of the
Parent Termination Fee or other damages to the Company.  
---|--- 

Section 9.10 Jurisdiction

 

In any Action between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties (i)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in
and for New Castle County, Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State
of Delaware; (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court; and (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any such action in any court other than the
Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County,
Delaware, or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and appellate
courts thereof. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process
outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.10_ in any such Action by mailing copies thereof by
registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.2_. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect
service of process on the other party by any other legally available method.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties agree (on behalf of itself
and its controlled Affiliates) that it will not bring or support any Action of
any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against the Lenders or any Lender Related Party in
any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or any other letter or
contract related to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum
other than any state or federal court sitting in the borough of Manhattan in
the city of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 

Section 9.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

 

EACH OF SIBELCO, PARENT, MERGER SUB, MERGER SUB LLC AND THE COMPANY WAIVES, TO

TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR

 



Page 115  RELATING TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS) OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT THE WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION
9.11_ SHALL EXTEND TO THE LENDERS AND THE LENDER RELATED PARTIES.

Section 9.12 Headings, etc.

 

The headings, table of contents and index of defined terms contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 9.13 Severability

 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon a
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in a
mutually acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to
the fullest extent possible.

   (a) | Sibelco, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries, except HPQ Co), heirs, successors and assigns

and assumes the risk of facts being other than or different from the
assumptions and perceptions as of any date prior to and including the Closing

valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

STOCKHOLDERS CONSENT;

AGREEMENT TO VOTE AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY

 

Section 1.1 Agreement to Vote

Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, from the
Effective Date until the earlier of (a) the time that the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained and (b) termination of this Agreement in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ (the _Agreement Term_ ), such Stockholder shall
(i) take all such actions as may be reasonably required to cause each of such
Stockholders Owned Shares to be present, in person or by proxy, at the
Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) at any Company  Stockholders Meeting vote (or cause to be voted), to the extent entitled to
vote thereon, all of such Stockholders Owned Shares:

 



   (A) | in favor of (I) adoption of the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Mergers and (II) the approval of any proposal to
adjourn such Company Stockholders Meeting to a later date if there are
not sufficient votes for adoption of the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Mergers; and 
---|--- 



   (B) | against (I) any Company Alternative Transaction, (II) any action
that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
under the Merger Agreement or of such Stockholder under this Agreement, (III)
any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, frustrate,
interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the consummation of
the Mergers or the other Transactions (in contravention of the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement), (IV) any merger agreement or merger
(other than the Merger Agreement and the Mergers), consolidation, combination,
material business transaction, sale of assets, reorganization,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, and (V) any amendment of the Companys organizational
documents that would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub LLC to complete the Mergers, or that
would or would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, frustrate, interfere
with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the consummation of the Mergers. 
---|--- 

Section 1.2 Other Voting Rights

 

For the avoidance of doubt, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any Stockholder to vote
in favor of, against, or abstain with respect to any matter presented to the
Companys stockholders not addressed by this Agreement.

 

Section 1.3 Grant of Irrevocable Proxy

Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints Parent and any designee of
Parent, and each of them individually, as such Stockholders proxy and
attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote
at the Company Stockholders Meeting during the Agreement Term, with respect to
such Stockholders Owned Shares as of the applicable record date, in each case
solely to the extent and in the manner specified in _Section_ __ _ 1.1_ (the
_Proxy_ ); _provided_ , however, that such Proxy shall be effective if, and
only if, the Stockholder has not delivered to the Secretary of the Company, at
least two Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, a duly
executed proxy card directing that such Stockholders Owned Shares be voted in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.1_. The Proxy is given to secure the
performance of the duties of each Stockholder under this Agreement, and its
existence will not be deemed to relieve any Stockholder of such Stockholders
obligations under this Agreement. The Proxy shall expire and be deemed revoked
automatically at the expiration of the Agreement Term or in the event of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1_.

 



2 Section 1.4 Nature of Irrevocable Proxy

 

The Proxy granted by each Stockholder is irrevocable during the Agreement Term
or until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.1_,
shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an
irrevocable proxy and shall revoke any and all prior proxies granted by any
Stockholder with regard to such Stockholders Owned Shares and each
Stockholder acknowledges that the Proxy constitutes an inducement for Parent,
Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC to enter into the Merger Agreement. The power of
attorney granted by each Stockholder is a durable power of attorney and shall
survive the bankruptcy, dissolution, death or incapacity of such Stockholder.

ARTICLE II

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE STOCKHOLDERS

 

Each Stockholder, on behalf of itself, severally, but not jointly, hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as of the Effective Date:

 

Section 2.1 Power; Due Authorization; Binding Agreement

authorized by all necessary corporate, partnership or other applicable action
on the part of such Stockholder, and no other proceedings on the part of such
Stockholder are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by such Stockholder and, assuming the due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other Parties, constitutes
a valid and binding agreement of such Stockholder, enforceable against such

subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights
generally.

Agreement and except for such transfer restrictions of general applicability
as may be provided under the Securities Act, as of the Effective Date such

Shares pursuant to any Contract to which such Stockholder is a party or by
which such Stockholder or any of the Owned Shares are bound, or (d) violate
any Applicable Laws applicable to such Stockholder or any of its assets
(including the Owned Shares), except for any of the foregoing which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or impair in
any material respect the Stockholders ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Section 2.6 Actions and Proceedings

There are no (a) Actions pending or, to the knowledge of such Stockholder,
threatened against such Stockholder or any of its assets or (b) outstanding

would prevent, materially delay or impair in any material respect
such Stockholders ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

_provided_ , that, the foregoing notwithstanding, the following Transfers are

acceptable to Parent) to be bound by the terms of this Agreement; or (ii)
Transfers of Owned Shares with Parents prior written consent.

Section 3.2 Additional Securities 

From the Effective Date until the earlier of (a) the termination of this

other voting securities of the Company, (ii) any securities which may be
converted into or exchanged for such share or other securities, or (iii) any

terms of this Agreement and the covenants applicable to the Owned Shares
hereunder shall apply to such Additional Securities as though owned by the
Stockholder on the Effective Date.

 

Section 3.3 Merger Agreement Obligations

Each Stockholder agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(other than passive investors in the Stockholder who are not otherwise
Affiliates of the Stockholder or involved in advising or managing such
Stockholder or any of its Affiliates) and each of its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through another person, (a)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information), or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any
inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which
would constitute a Company Alternative Transaction, (b) engage or participate
in any substantive discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way with
any person (or group of persons), with respect to any inquiries regarding, or
the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a
Company Alternative Transaction, except to notify such person (or group of
persons) as to the existence of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_,
(c) grant any waiver or release under (i) any standstill provision in any
Contract to which the Company is a party or (ii) any confidentiality provision
in any Contract to which the Company is a party other than, with respect to
this clause (ii), any waiver or release under a confidentiality provision in
any agreement entered into by the Company which is not related to, or in
contemplation of, a Company Alternative Transaction (except, in the case of
this clause (c), if the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under Applicable
Law), or (d) resolve, publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing;
provided that the foregoing shall not restrict such Stockholder, or any of
such Stockholders directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members
or Affiliates, from taking any such actions on behalf of or as a
representative of the Company that would not constitute a breach of the Merger
Agreement.

 



5 Section 3.4 No Limitations on Actions

 

Parent expressly acknowledges that each Stockholder is entering into this
Agreement solely in such Stockholders capacity as the beneficial owner of
Owned Shares and this Agreement shall not limit or otherwise affect the
actions or fiduciary duties of such Stockholder, or any of such Stockholders
Affiliates, in such Stockholders, or any of such Stockholders
Affiliates, capacity, if applicable, as a director of the Company. Parent
shall not assert any claim that any action taken by such Stockholder, or any
of such Stockholders Affiliates, in such Stockholders, or any of such
Stockholders Affiliates, capacity, if applicable, as a director of the
Company violates any provision of this Agreement.

Section 3.5 Further Assurances 

From time to time, at the reasonable request of Parent and without further
consideration, each Stockholder shall, at Parents cost and expense, use
reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver such additional documents and
take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary to comply with
such Stockholders obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 3.6 General Covenants

Each Stockholder agrees that such Stockholder shall not:



   (a) | enter into any Contract with any person or take any other action

with, such Stockholders representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations under this Agreement; or

ARTICLE IV

 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 4.1 Termination of this Agreement

This Agreement, and all obligations, terms and conditions contained herein,
shall automatically terminate without any further action required by any
Party upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, (b) the Effective Time, and (c) the
Board of Directors of the Company making a Company Recommendation Change. In
addition to the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated, (d) with respect
to an individual Stockholder, (i) at any time by written consent of Parent and
such Stockholder and (ii) by the Stockholder following any amendment, change
or modification to the Merger Agreement affecting the Merger Consideration in
a manner detrimental to the Stockholder or Article VII of the Merger Agreement
or that would other otherwise have a material adverse effect on the
Stockholder, or (e) with respect to all Stockholders, at any time by written
consent of the Parties.

 



6 Section 4.2 Effect of Termination

 

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability on
the part of any Party; _provided_ , however, no such termination shall relieve
any Party from any liability for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior
to such termination and the provisions of this _ARTICLE IV_ , shall survive
any such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, termination of this
Agreement shall not prevent any Party from seeking any remedies (at law or in
equity) against any other Party for that Partys breach of any of the terms of
this Agreement prior to the date of termination.

Section 4.3 Entire Agreement; Assignment.

 

This Agreement (together with the Merger Agreement, to the extent referred to
in this Agreement) and any documents delivered by the Parties in
connection herewith constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof. Other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.12_,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation
of law or otherwise, by any Party without the prior written consent of the
other Parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

 

Section 4.4 Amendments and Waivers

This Agreement may only be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment
or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by each of
the Parties, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver
is to be effective. No failure or delay by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub
LLC in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder.

 

Section 4.5 Notices

All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, or, if confirmed, faxed or emailed, or sent by overnight courier

Section 4.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial



   (a) | This Agreement and all Actions (whether based on contract, tort
or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of
Parent or Merger Sub in the negotiation, administration, performance
and enforcement thereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under any applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. 
---|--- 
 



   (b) |

In any Action between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Parties (i)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in
and for New Castle County, Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State
of Delaware; (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court; and (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any such action in any court other than the
Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County,
Delaware, or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and appellate
courts thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process
outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.6_ in 

---|--- 
 



8 certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.5_. However,
the foregoing shall not limit the right of a Party to effect service of
process on the other party by any other legally available method. 
---|--- 
 



   (c) | EACH STOCKHOLDER AND EACH OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. 
---|--- 

Section 4.7 Specific Performance

 

The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court referred to _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ above, without proof of actual damages
(and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

 

Section 4.8 Counterparts; Effectiveness

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
(including by electronic transmission) to the other Parties.

Section 4.9 Headings

 

The headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.10 Severability

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon a
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in a
mutually acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to
the fullest extent possible.

 



9 Section 4.11 Interpretation

 

When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit,
such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to,
this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto,"
"hereby," "herein" __ and "hereunder _"_ __ and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive.
The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which
a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to a person are also to
its permitted successors and assigns. Unless otherwise specifically
indicated, all references to dollars __ and $ will be deemed references to the
lawful money of the United States of America.

 

Section 4.12 Publication

Each Stockholder hereby permits Parent, the Company and Merger Sub to publish
and disclose in any documents or schedules filed with the SEC and any other
disclosures or filings required by Applicable Law such Stockholders identity
and ownership of the Owned Shares and the nature of such Stockholders
commitments pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

Section 3.1 Pre-emptive Right

   (a) | Additional Issuance Notices. The Company shall give written
notice (an _Issuance Notice_ ) of any proposed issuance or sale of New
Securities described in Section 3.1(a) to Sibelco within five Business Days
following any meeting of the Board at which any such issuance or sale is
approved. The Issuance Notice shall, if applicable, be accompanied by a
written offer from any prospective purchaser seeking to purchase the

the material terms and conditions of the proposed issuance or sale, including: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | the number and description of New Securities proposed to be

Exercise Period_) have the right to elect to purchase (or to have a designee
purchase) all or any portion of its Pre-emptive Pro Rata Portion of any New
Securities on the terms and conditions, including the purchase price, set
forth in the Issuance Notice by delivering a written notice to the Company (a
_Pre-emptive Acceptance Notice_) specifying the number of New Securities it
desires to purchase up to its Pre-emptive Pro Rata Portion. Subject to the
last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_, the failure of Sibelco to deliver a
Pre-emptive Acceptance Notice by the end of the Pre-emptive Exercise Period
shall constitute a waiver of its rights under this  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_

rights with respect to any future issuances or sales of New Securities. 
---|--- 
 



   (c) | Sales to the Prospective Purchaser. Following the expiration of

proposed issuance or sale of New Securities described in the Issuance Notice
with respect to which Sibelco declined or failed to exercise the pre-emptive
right set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ on terms no less favorable in
all material respects to the Company than those set forth in the Issuance
Notice (except that the amount of New Securities to be issued or sold by the
Company may be reduced); provided that: (i) such issuance or sale is closed
within 60 Business Days after the expiration of the Pre-emptive Exercise
Period (the _Issuance Cut-off_); and (ii) the price at which the New
Securities are sold to the Prospective Purchaser is at least equal to or
higher than the purchase price described in the Issuance Notice. In the event
the Company has not sold such New Securities by the Issuance Cut-off,
the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any New Securities without
first again offering such securities to Sibelco in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 3.1_. 
---|--- 
 



-10- Securities in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, the Company shall
deliver the New Securities, free and clear of any liens (other than those
arising hereunder and those arising pursuant to applicable securities laws).

purchased by it by certified or bank check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds. Each party to the purchase and sale of New
Securities shall take all such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to
consummate the purchase and sale including, entering into such additional
agreements as may be necessary or appropriate.

the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions

Section 7.5 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Additional
Representations

 



   (a) | This Agreement (including the documents, exhibits, schedules and
instruments referred to herein), (i) constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and the

and shall not confer upon any Person other than the Parties (and their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns) any

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
otherwise by

 



-15-  any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties;
provided, however, that Sibelco may assign its rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior
written consent of the other Parties to any wholly owned Affiliate of Sibelco
that holds or owns Shares; provided further, however, that any such assignment
shall not relieve Sibelco of its obligations hereunder. Any purported
assignment in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to

forth in this Agreement, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective permitted

Section 7.7 Amendment

 

No provision of this Agreement may be amended or modified except by an

binding upon the Company and each Stockholder.

 

Section 7.8 Waiver

No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective
unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No
waiver by any Party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of
any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written
waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring
before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising,
any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall
operate or be construed as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power
or privilege. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this _Section_
__ _ 7.8_ shall diminish any of the explicit and implicit waivers described
in this Agreement.

 

Section 7.9 Governing Law

This Agreement and all actions (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of the Company or
any Stockholder in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement thereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under any applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

Section 7.10 Submission to Jurisdiction

In any suit, action or proceeding between the Parties arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
each of the Parties (i) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware or any federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware; (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such
court; and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any such action in any

 



-16-  court other than the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in and for
New Castle County, Delaware, or any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware and appellate courts thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred
to in this _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ in any such suit, action or proceeding by
mailing copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.2_. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a
Party to effect service of process on any other Party by any other legally
available method.

Section 7.11 Waiver of Jury Trial

 

EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 7.12 Specific Enforcement

The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and (as an integral and
essential part of the transactions contemplated hereby without which the
parties would not have entered into this Agreement) to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.10_, without proof of actual damages (and
each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

Section 7.13 Counterparts

 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
(including by electronic transmission) to the other Parties.

Section 7.14 Enforcement by Fairmount Directors

All of the Companys rights under this Agreement may be enforced by the
Fairmount Directors; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall require
the Fairmount Directors to act on behalf of, or enforce any rights of, the
Company. Any recovery in connection with an action brought by the Fairmount
Directors hereunder shall be for the proportionate benefit of all
Stockholders.

their duly authorized representatives as of the date first written above.

Section 2\. _Registration Rights_.

 

2.1. _Demand Registrations_.

 

(a) (i) Subject to Sections 2.1(b) and 2.3, at any time and from time to time
beginning 180 days following the date hereof, any of the Shareholders (each,
a " _Demand Party_ " and, together, the " _Demand Parties_ ") shall have the
right to require the Company to file one or more registration statements under
the Securities Act covering all or any part of its Registrable Securities by
delivering a written request therefor to the Company specifying the number of
Registrable Securities to be included in such registration and the intended
method of distribution thereof. Any such request by any Demand Party pursuant
to this Section 2.1(a)(i) is referred to herein as a " _Demand Registration
Request_ " and the registration so requested is referred to herein as a "
_Demand Registration_ " (with respect to any Demand Registration, the
Holder(s) making such demand for registration being referred to as the "
_Initiating Holders_ "). Any Demand Registration Request may request that the
Company register Registrable Securities on an appropriate form, including a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act and, if the Company is a well-known seasoned issuer (as defined
in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, a " _WKSI_ "), an automatic shelf
registration statement on Form S-3. The Company shall give written notice (the
" _Demand Exercise Notice_ ") of such Demand Registration Request to each of
the Holders of Registrable Securities at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the filing of any registration statement under the Securities Act.

 

(ii) The Company, subject to Sections 2.3 and 2.6, shall include in a Demand
Registration (x) the Registrable Securities of the Initiating Holders and (y)
the Registrable Securities of any other Holder of Registrable Securities that
shall have made a written request to the Company for inclusion in such
registration pursuant to Section 2.2 (which request shall specify the maximum
number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such
Participating Holder) within five (5) days following the receipt of any such
Demand Exercise Notice.

 

(iii) The Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible, but subject
to Section 2.1(b), use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) file with
the SEC (no later than sixty (60) days from the Companys receipt of the
applicable Demand Registration Request) and cause to be declared or
automatically effective, as applicable, such registration under
the Securities Act as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter (including,
without limitation, by means of a shelf registration pursuant to Rule 415
under the Securities Act if so requested and if

 



6  the Company is then eligible to use such a registration) with respect to the
Registrable Securities that the Company has been so requested to register, for
distribution in accordance with the intended method of distribution,
including a distribution to, and resale by, the members or partners of a
Holder (a " _Partner Distribution_ ") and (y) if requested by the Initiating
Holders and to the extent applicable, obtain acceleration of the effective
date of the registration statement relating to such registration.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company
shall, at the request of any Holder seeking to effect a Partner Distribution,
file any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendments, or include in the
initial registration statement any disclosure or language, or include in any
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment any disclosure or language,
and otherwise take any action, deemed necessary or advisable by such Holder to
effect such Partner Distribution.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.1(a), the Demand
Registration rights granted in Section 2.1(a) are subject to the following
limitations: (i) the Company shall not be required to (a) cause a registration
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) to be declared or automatically effective, as
applicable, or (b) facilitate an offering of Shares, in either case within a
period of ninety (90) days after the effective date of any other registration
of the Company filed pursuant to the Securities Act (other than a Form S-4 or
Form S-8 or any successor or other forms promulgated for similar purposes or
forms filed in connection with an exchange offer or any employee benefit or
stock purchase and/or dividend reinvestment plan) or pricing date of any
offering made pursuant to such registration statement; (ii) the Company shall
not be required to effect more than (x) five (5) Demand Registrations on Form
S-1 or any similar long-form registration at the request of the Shareholders
(it being understood that if a single Demand Registration Request is delivered
by more than one Shareholder, the registration requested by such Demand
Registration Request shall constitute only one Demand Registration);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholders shall each be entitled to
request an unlimited number of Demand Registrations on Form S-3 or any similar
short-form registration (including pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities
Act) or take-downs or other offerings off an existing Form S-3; (iii) each
registration or offering in respect of a Demand Registration Request made by
any Holder must include, in the aggregate, Shares having an aggregate market
value of at least the lesser of (a) the Minimum Threshold (based on the Shares
included in such registration by all Holders participating in such
registration) and (b) the Initiating Holders remaining Shares; (iv) a Holder
may not request that the Company file a shelf registration statement until the
Company is eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3; and (v) if
a Valid Business Reason exists, then (x) the Company may postpone filing a
registration statement or facilitating an offering relating to a Demand
Registration Request until five (5) Business Days after such Valid Business
Reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than forty-five (45) days
(seventy-five (75) days in the case of a Valid Business Reason relating to the
Company not having appropriate financial statements of any acquired or to be
acquired entities available for filing) after the date the Valid Business
Reason is initially determined to exist and (y) in case a registration
statement has been filed relating to a Demand Registration Request, the
Company may, to the extent a Valid Business Reason exists, suspend use of or,
if required by the SEC, cause such registration statement to be withdrawn and
its effectiveness terminated or may postpone amending or 

 



7  supplementing such registration statement until five (5) Business Days after
such Valid Business Reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than
thirty (30) days after the date the Valid Business Reason is initially
determined to exist (such period of postponement or withdrawal under this
clause (v), the " _Postponement Period_ "). The Company shall give written
notice to the Initiating Holders and any other Holders that have requested
registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or Section 2.2 of its determination to
postpone or suspend use of or withdraw a registration statement and of the
fact that the Valid Business Reason for such postponement or suspension or
withdrawal no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence
thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall not be permitted to
postpone or suspend use of or withdraw a registration statement after
the expiration of any Postponement Period until twelve (12) months after the
expiration of such Postponement Period.

If the Company shall give any notice of postponement or suspension or
withdrawal of any registration statement pursuant to clause (v) above, the
Company shall not, during the Postponement Period, register any Shares, other
than pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 (or an
equivalent registration form then in effect). Each Holder of Registrable
Securities agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company that the
Company has determined to suspend use of, withdraw, terminate or postpone
amending or supplementing any registration statement pursuant to clause (v)
above, such Holder will discontinue its disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such registration statement. If the Company shall have
suspended use of, withdrawn or terminated a registration statement filed under
Section 2.1(a)(i) (whether pursuant to clause (v) above or as a result of any
stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or any other
governmental agency or court), the Company shall not be considered to have
effected a Demand Registration for the purposes of this Agreement until the
Company shall have permitted use of such suspended registration statement or
filed a new registration statement covering the Registrable Securities covered
by the withdrawn or terminated registration statement and such registration
statement shall have been declared effective and shall not have been
withdrawn. If the Company shall give any notice of suspension, withdrawal or
postponement of a registration statement, the Company shall, not later than
five (5) Business Days after the Valid Business Reason that caused
such suspension, withdrawal or postponement no longer exists (but in no event
later than thirty (30) days after the date of the suspension, postponement or
withdrawal), as applicable, permit use of such suspended registration
statement or use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the
registration under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities covered by
the withdrawn or postponed registration statement in accordance with this
Section 2.1 (unless the Initiating Holders shall have withdrawn such request,
in which case the Company shall not be considered to have effected a Demand
Registration for the purposes of this Agreement and such request shall not
count as a Demand Registration Request under this Agreement), and following
such permission or such effectiveness such registration shall no longer be
deemed to be suspended, withdrawn or postponed pursuant to clause (v) of
Section 2.1(b) above.

 

(c) In connection with any Demand Registration (including any Shelf
Underwriting or Underwritten Block Trade (as defined below)), the Holders of
a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such Demand Registration
shall have the right to designate the lead managing underwriter (any lead
managing underwriter for the purposes of this Agreement, the 

 



8  " _Manager_ ") in connection with any underwritten offering pursuant to such
registration and each other managing underwriter for any such underwritten
offering and counsel for the Participating Shareholders; _provided_ that in
each case, each such underwriter is reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(d) No Demand Registration shall be deemed to have occurred for purposes of
Section 2.1(a) (i) if the registration statement relating thereto (x) does
not become effective, (y) is not maintained effective for a period of at least
one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date thereof or such shorter
period during which all Registrable Securities included in such registration
statement have actually been sold ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such period
shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the Holder of
Registrable Securities refrains from selling any securities included in such
registration statement at the request of the Company or an underwriter of the
Company), or (z) is subject to a stop order, injunction, or similar order or
requirement of the SEC during such period, (ii) if any of the Registrable
Securities requested by such Initiating Holder to be included in such Demand
Registration are not so included pursuant to Section 2.3 (even where some or
most of such Holders Registrable Securities are included in such
Demand Registration), (iii) if the method of disposition is a firm commitment
underwritten public offering and any of the applicable Registrable Securities
identified in the preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement,
as applicable, for such offering as being sold by the Participating Holders
have not been sold pursuant thereto (other than as a result of a default or
breach thereunder by such Initiating Holder(s)) or (iv) if the conditions to
closing specified in any underwriting agreement, purchase agreement or
similar agreement entered into in connection with the registration relating to
such request are not satisfied (other than as a result of a default or breach
thereunder by such Initiating Holder(s)) or are otherwise not waived by such
Initiating Holder(s).

(e) In the event that the Company files a shelf registration statement
under Rule 415 of the Securities Act pursuant to a Demand Registration
Request and such registration becomes effective (such registration statement,
a " _Shelf Registration Statement_ "), the Initiating Holders with respect to
such Demand Registration Request and the other Demand Parties with
Registrable Securities registered on such Shelf Registration Statement (or, in
the case of an automatic shelf registration statement, the Demand Parties)
shall have the right at any time or from time to time to elect to sell
pursuant to an underwritten offering Registrable Securities available for sale
pursuant to such registration statement. Any such Initiating Holder or Demand
Party shall make such election by delivering to the Company a written request
(a " _Shelf Underwriting Request_ ") for such underwritten offering specifying
the number of Registrable Securities that such Initiating Holder or Demand
Party, as applicable, desires to sell pursuant to such underwritten offering
(the " _Shelf Underwriting_ "). As promptly as practicable, but no later than
two (2) Business Days after receipt of a Shelf Underwriting Request, the
Company shall give written notice (the " _Shelf Underwriting Notice_ ") of
such Shelf Underwriting Request to the Holders of other Registrable Securities
registered on such Shelf Registration Statement (" _Shelf Registrable
Securities_ "). The Company, subject to Sections 2.3 and 2.6, shall include
in such Shelf Underwriting (x) the Registrable Securities of the Initiating
Holders and (y) the Shelf Registrable Securities of any other Holder of Shelf
Registrable Securities that shall have made a written request to the Company
for inclusion in such Shelf Underwriting (which request shall

 



9  specify the maximum number of Shelf Registrable Securities intended to be
disposed of by such Holder) within five (5) days after the receipt of the
Shelf Underwriting Notice. The Company shall, as expeditiously as possible
(and in any event within twenty (20) days after the receipt of a Shelf
Underwriting Request), but subject to Section 2.1(b), use its commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate such Shelf Underwriting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, but subject to Section 2.1(b), if a Demand Party wishes to engage
in an underwritten block trade or similar transaction or other transaction
with a 2-day or less marketing period (collectively, " _Underwritten Block
Trade_ ") pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement (either through filing an
automatic shelf registration statement or through a take-down from an already
effective Shelf Registration Statement), then notwithstanding the foregoing
time periods, such Demand Party only needs to notify the Company of the
Underwritten Block Trade two (2) Business Days prior to the day such
Underwritten Block Trade is to commence, and the Company shall notify the
other Holders (the " _Company Block Trade Notice_ ") on the same day, and such
other Holders must elect whether or not to participate by the next Business
Day (i.e., one (1) Business Day prior to the date such offering is to
commence). The Company shall as expeditiously as possible, but subject to
Section 2.1(b), use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate such
Underwritten Block Trade (which may close as early as two (2) Business
Days after the date it commences); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Demand
Party requesting such Underwritten Block Trade shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to work with the Company and the underwriters prior to
making such request in order to facilitate preparation of the registration
statement (including filing an automatic shelf registration statement),
prospectus and other offering documentation related to the Underwritten Block
Trade. In the event a Demand Party requests such an Underwritten Block Trade,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.1 or in Section
2.2, any holder of Shares who is not a Holder shall have no right to notice of
or to participate in such Underwritten Block Trade at any time. The Company
shall, at the request of any Initiating Holder, file any prospectus supplement
or, if the applicable Shelf Registration Statement is an automatic shelf
registration statement, any post-effective amendments and otherwise take any
action necessary to include therein all disclosure and language deemed
necessary or advisable by the Initiating Holders or any other Holder of Shelf
Registrable Securities to effect such Shelf Underwriting. Once a Shelf
Registration Statement has been declared effective, the Demand Parties may
request, and the Company shall be required to facilitate, subject to Section
2.1(b), an unlimited number of Shelf Underwritings with respect to such Shelf
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 2.1(e), each Shelf Underwriting must include, in the aggregate, Shares
having an aggregate market value of at least the lesser of (a) the Minimum
Threshold (based on the Shares included in such Shelf Underwriting by all
Holders participating in such Shelf Underwriting) and (b) the Initiating
Holders remaining Shares.

 

(f) Any Initiating Holder may revoke a Demand Registration Request delivered
by such Initiating Holder at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Demand Registration and such Demand Registration shall have no further force
or effect and such request shall not count as a Demand Registration Request
under this Agreement.

 

(g) In the event that any Holder fails to take all steps necessary to commence
an Underwritten Block Trade within two (2) Business Days of the date on which
a Company Block

 



10  Trade Notice is sent to such Holder, then, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the Demand Party requesting the Underwritten
Block Trade shall have the right to exclude such Holder from participating in
such Underwritten Block Trade.

2.2. _Piggyback Registrations_.

 

(a) If the Company proposes or is required (pursuant to Section 2.1 or
otherwise) to register any Shares for its own account or for the account of
any other shareholder under the Securities Act (other than a Form S-4 or Form
S-8 or any successor or other forms promulgated for similar purposes or
forms filed in connection with an exchange offer or any employee benefit or
stock purchase and/or dividend reinvestment plan or a registration statement
registering Shares that are issuable solely upon conversion of Share
Equivalents), the Company shall give written notice (the " _Piggyback Notice_
") of its intention to do so to each of the Holders of Registrable Securities
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the filing of any registration
statement under the Securities Act. Upon the written request of any such
Holder, made within five (5) days following the receipt of any such Piggyback
Notice (which request shall specify the maximum number of Registrable
Securities intended to be disposed of by such Holder and the intended method
of distribution thereof), the Company shall, subject to Sections 2.2(c),
2.2(f), 2.3 and 2.6 hereof, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all such Registrable Securities, the Holders of which have so requested
the registration thereof, to be registered under the Securities Act with the
securities that the Company at the time proposes to register to permit the
sale or other disposition by the Holders (in accordance with the intended
method of distribution thereof) of the Registrable Securities to be so
registered, including, if necessary, by filing with the SEC a post-effective
amendment or a supplement to the registration statement filed by the Company
or the prospectus related thereto. There is no limitation on the number of
such piggyback registrations pursuant to the preceding sentence that the
Company is obligated to effect. No registration of Registrable Securities
effected under this Section 2.2(a) shall relieve the Company of
its obligations to effect Demand Registrations under Section 2.1 hereof. If
the Company proposes or is required (pursuant to Section 2.1 or otherwise) to
sell pursuant to an underwritten offering Registrable Securities available for
sale pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement (a " _Company Shelf
Underwriting_ "), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, give written
notice of such Company Shelf Underwriting (a " _Company Shelf Notice_ ") to
each Holder of Shelf Registrable Securities. In addition to any equity
securities that the Company proposes to sell for its own account in such
Company Shelf Underwriting, the Company shall, subject to Sections 2.3 and
2.6, include in such Company Shelf Underwriting the Shelf Registrable
Securities of any other Holder of Shelf Registrable Securities that shall have
made a written request to the Company for inclusion in such Company Shelf
Underwriting (which request shall specify the maximum number of Shelf
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Holder) within five
(5) Business Days after the receipt of the Company Shelf Notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if the Company wishes to engage in an
Underwritten Block Trade pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement (a "
_Company Underwritten Block Trade_ "), then notwithstanding the foregoing time
periods, the Company only needs to notify the Holders of the Company
Underwritten Block Trade two (2) Business Days prior to the day such Company
Underwritten Block Trade is to commence and the Company shall notify the
Holders and such Holders must elect whether or not to participate by the next
Business Day (i.e., one (1) 

 



11  Business Day prior to the date such Underwritten Block Trade is to
commence), and the Company shall as expeditiously as possible use its
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate such Company Underwritten Block
Trade (which may close as early as two (2) Business Days after the date it
commences), and (y) if a Demand Party wishes to engage in an Underwritten
Block Trade pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, then the provisions
set forth in Section 2.1(e) shall apply to such Underwritten Block Trade. In
the event the Company or a Demand Party requests a Company Underwritten Block
Trade or an Underwritten Block Trade, as applicable, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 2.1 or in this Section 2.2, any holder of
Shares who does not constitute a Holder shall have no right to notice of or to
participate in such Company Underwritten Block Trade or Underwritten Block
Trade, as applicable.

(b) The Company, subject to Sections 2.3 and 2.6 and the final sentence of
Section 2.2(a), may elect to include in any registration statement and
offering pursuant to demand registration rights by any Person or otherwise,
(i) authorized but unissued Shares or Shares held by the Company as treasury
shares and (ii) any other Shares that are requested to be included in such
registration pursuant to the exercise of piggyback registration rights granted
by the Company after the date hereof and that are not inconsistent with the
rights granted in, or otherwise conflict with the terms of, this Agreement ("
_Additional Piggyback Rights_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect
to any underwritten offering, including a block trade, such inclusion shall be
permitted only to the extent that it is pursuant to, and subject to, the
terms of the underwriting agreement or arrangements, if any, entered into by
the Initiating Holders or the Majority Participating Holders in such
underwritten offering.

 

(c) If, at any time after giving a Piggyback Notice and prior to the effective
date of the registration statement filed in connection with such
registration, (i) any Initiating Holder determines for any reason not to
proceed with the proposed registration, the Company may at its election give
written notice of such determination to each Holder of record of Registrable
Securities and thereupon will be relieved of its obligation to register any
Registrable Securities in connection with such registration and (ii) other
than in connection with a Demand Registration, the Company shall determine for
any reason not to register or to delay registration of such equity
securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to all Holders of record of Registrable Securities and (x) in
the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its
obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with such
abandoned registration, without prejudice, however, to the rights of Holders
under Section 2.1, and (y) in the case of a determination to delay such
registration of its equity securities, shall be permitted to delay the
registration of such Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay
in registering such other equity securities.

 

(d) Any Holder shall have the right to withdraw its request for inclusion of
its Registrable Securities in any registration statement pursuant to this
Section 2.2 by giving written notice to the Company of its request to
withdraw; _provided_ , _however_ , that such request must be made in writing
prior to the earlier of the execution of the underwriting agreement or
the execution of the custody agreement with respect to such registration or
as otherwise required by the underwriters.

 



12 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the piggyback
registration rights granted pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall automatically
terminate at such time as both (i) the Registrable Securities beneficially
owned by the Shareholders no longer constitute at least five percent (5%) of
the outstanding Shares and (ii) no Shareholder is an "affiliate" of the
Company (within the meaning of Rule 144).

2.3. _Allocation of Securities Included in Registration Statement_.

(a) If any requested registration made pursuant to Section 2.1 (including a
Shelf Underwriting) involves (x) an underwritten offering and the Manager of
such offering shall advise the Company and any Holder of Registrable
Securities included in such underwritten offering that, in its view, the
number of securities requested to be included in such underwritten offering
by the Holders of Registrable Securities, the Company or any other Persons
exercising Additional Piggyback Rights exceeds the largest number (the "
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)(x) Sale Number_") that can be sold in an orderly
manner in such underwritten offering within a price range acceptable to the
Initiating Holders and the Majority Participating Holders, or (y) an
Underwritten Block Trade and the number of securities requested to be
included in such Underwritten Block Trade by the Holders of Registrable
Securities or any other Persons exceeds the number that are sold in any such
Underwritten Block Trade (the " _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a) Block Trade Sale
Number_" and, together with the Section 2.3(a)(x) Sale Number, the " _Section_
__ _ 2.3(a) Sale Number_"), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to include in such underwritten offering:

(i) first, all Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
underwritten offering by the Holders thereof (including pursuant to the
exercise of piggyback rights pursuant to Section 2.2(a)); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the number of such Registrable Securities exceeds the
Section 2.3(a) Sale Number, the number of such Registrable Securities (not to
exceed the Section 2.3(a) Sale Number) to be included in such underwritten
offering shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among all Holders requesting
that Registrable Securities be included in such underwritten offering
(including pursuant to the exercise of piggyback rights pursuant to Section
2.2(a)), based on the number of Registrable Securities then owned by each such
Holder requesting inclusion in relation to the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities owned by all Holders requesting inclusion;

(ii) second, to the extent that the number of Registrable Securities to be
included pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.3(a) is less than the
Section 2.3(a) Sale Number, any securities that the Company proposes to
register or sell, up to the Section 2.3(a) Sale Number; and

 

(iii) third, to the extent that the number of Registrable Securities to be
included pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 2.3(a) is less than
the Section 2.3(a) Sale Number, the remaining securities to be included in
such underwritten offering shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among all
Persons requesting that securities be included in such underwritten offering
pursuant to the exercise of Additional Piggyback Rights (" _Additional
Piggyback Shares_ "), based on the number of Additional Piggyback Shares then
owned by each Person requesting inclusion in relation to the aggregate number
of Additional Piggyback Shares owned by all Persons requesting inclusion, up
to the Section 2.3(a) Sale Number.

 



13 (b) If any registration or offering made pursuant to Section 2.2 involves (x)
an underwritten primary offering on behalf of the Company after the date
hereof and the Manager shall advise the Company that, in its view, the number
of securities requested to be included in such underwritten offering by the
Holders of Registrable Securities, the Company or any other Persons
exercising Additional Piggyback Rights exceeds the largest number (the "
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(x) Sale Number_") that can be sold in an orderly manner
in such underwritten offering within a price range acceptable to the Company
or (y) a Company Underwritten Block Trade and the number of securities
requested to be included in such Company Underwritten Block Trade by the
Company, the Holders of Registrable Securities or any other Persons exceeds
the number that are sold in any such Company Underwritten Block Trade (the "
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b) Block Trade Sale Number_" and, together with the
Section 2.3(b)(x) Sale Number, the " _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b) Sale Number_"),
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to include in such
underwritten offering:

 

(i) first, all equity securities that the Company proposes to register or sell
for its own account;

 

(ii) second, to the extent that the number of Registrable Securities to be
included pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.3(b) is less than the
Section 2.3(b) Sale Number, the remaining Registrable Securities to be
included in such underwritten offering shall be allocated on a pro rata basis
among all Holders requesting that Registrable Securities be included in
such underwritten offering pursuant to the exercise of piggyback rights
pursuant to Section 2.2(a), based on the number of Registrable Securities then
owned by each such Holder requesting inclusion in relation to the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities owned by all Holders requesting inclusion,
up to the Section 2.3(b) Sale Number; and

(iii) third, to the extent that the number of Registrable Securities to be
included pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 2.3(b) is less than
the Section 2.3(b) Sale Number, the remaining securities to be included in
such underwritten offering shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among all
Persons requesting that securities be included in such underwritten offering
pursuant to the exercise of Additional Piggyback Rights, based on the number
of Additional Piggyback Shares then owned by each Person requesting inclusion
in relation to the aggregate number of Additional Piggyback Shares owned by
all Persons requesting inclusion, up to the Section 2.3(b) Sale Number.

 

(c) If any registration pursuant to Section 2.2 involves an underwritten
offering that was initially requested by any Person(s) (other than a Holder)
to whom the Company has granted registration rights that are not inconsistent
with the rights granted in, and do not otherwise conflict with the terms of,
this Agreement and the Manager shall advise the Company that, in its view,
the number of securities requested to be included in such underwritten
offering exceeds the number (the " _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c) Sale Number_") that
can be sold in an orderly manner in such underwritten offering within a
price range acceptable to the Company, the Company shall include in such
underwritten offering:

 



14 (i) first, the securities requested to be included in such underwritten
offering shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among such Person(s)
requesting the registration and all Holders requesting that Registrable
Securities be included in such underwritten offering pursuant to the exercise
of piggyback rights pursuant to Section 2.2(a), based on the aggregate number
of securities or Registrable Securities, as applicable, then owned by each of
the foregoing requesting inclusion in relation to the aggregate number of
securities or Registrable Securities, as applicable, owned by all such
Holders and Persons requesting inclusion, up to the Section 2.3(c) Sale
Number;

(ii) second, to the extent that the number of Registrable Securities and
securities to be included pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.3(c) is
less than the Section 2.3(c) Sale Number, the remaining securities to be
included in such underwritten offering shall be allocated on a pro rata basis
among all Persons requesting that securities be included in such underwritten
offering pursuant to the exercise of Additional Piggyback Rights, based on the
number of Additional Piggyback Shares then owned by each Person requesting
inclusion in relation to the aggregate number of Additional Piggyback Shares
owned by all Persons requesting inclusion, up to the Section 2.3(c) Sale
Number; and

 

(iii) third, to the extent that the number of Registrable Securities and
securities to be included pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section
2.3(c) is less than the Section 2.3(c) Sale Number, the remaining securities
to be included in such underwritten offering shall be allocated to shares the
Company proposes to register or sell for its own account, up to the Section
2.3(c) Sale Number.

(d) If, as a result of the proration provisions set forth in clauses (a), (b)
or (c) of this Section 2.3, any Holder shall not be entitled to include all
Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering that such Holder has
requested be included, such Holder may elect to withdraw such Holders request
to include Registrable Securities in the registration to which such
underwritten offering relates or may reduce the number requested to be
included; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) such request must be made in
writing prior to the earlier of the execution of the underwriting agreement
or the execution of the custody agreement with respect to such registration
and (y) such withdrawal or reduction shall be irrevocable and, after making
such withdrawal or reduction, such Holder shall no longer have any right to
include Registrable Securities in the registration as to which such withdrawal
or reduction was made to the extent of the Registrable Securities so withdrawn
or reduced. If more than one of the Shareholders desires to register or
sell Shares and the number of Shares to be sold by the Shareholders
collectively is to be reduced for any reason pursuant to Section 2.3 or
otherwise, than the Shareholders may allocate among themselves the number of
Shares each may register or sell (but capped at the maximum amount of Shares
they are permitted collectively to sell in such registration or offering).

 



15 2.4. _Registration Procedures_. If and whenever the Company is required by the
provisions of this Agreement to effect or cause the registration of and/or
participate in any offering or sale of any Registrable Securities under the
Securities Act as provided in this Agreement (or use commercially reasonable
efforts to accomplish the same), the Company shall, as expeditiously as
reasonably possible:

(a) prepare and file all filings with the SEC and FINRA required for
the consummation of the offering, including preparing and filing with the SEC
a registration statement on an appropriate registration form of the SEC for
the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method of disposition thereof (including, without limitation, a Partner
Distribution), which registration form (i) shall be selected by the Company
(except as provided for in a Demand Registration Request) and (ii) shall, in
the case of a shelf registration, be available for the sale of the
Registrable Securities by the selling Holders thereof and such registration
statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the applicable registration form and include all financial
statements required by the SEC to be filed therewith, and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement
to become effective and remain continuously effective for such period as any
Participating Holder pursuant to such registration statement shall reasonably
request ( _provided_ , _however_ , that as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto (other than any amendment by means of a
document filed by the Company under the Exchange Act) or any free writing
prospectus related thereto, the Company will furnish to the Demand Parties,
counsel for each of the Participating Holders and counsel for the Manager, if
any, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such documents proposed to be
filed (including all exhibits thereto and each document incorporated by
reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and regulations of
the SEC), which documents will be subject to the reasonable review and
reasonable comment of such counsel (including any objections to any
information pertaining to any Participating Holder and its plan of
distribution and otherwise to the extent necessary, if at all, to complete
the filing or maintain the effectiveness thereof), and the Company shall make
the changes reasonably requested by such counsel and shall not file any
registration statement or amendment thereto (other than any amendment by
means of a document filed by the Company under the Exchange Act), any
prospectus or supplement thereto or any free writing prospectus related
thereto to which counsel for the Participating Holders, the
Majority Participating Holders or the underwriters, if any, shall reasonably
object); _provided_ , however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the Company be required to file any document with the SEC that in
the view of the Company or its counsel contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make any statement therein not misleading; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any Participating Holder shall be entitled to review and
provide reasonable comment on disclosure regarding itself included or proposed
to be included in any such filing;

 

(b) (i) subject to Section 2.1(b), prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus
used in connection therewith and such free writing prospectuses and Exchange
Act reports as may be necessary to keep such registration statement
continuously effective for such period as any Participating Holder pursuant 

 



16  to such registration statement shall reasonably request and to comply in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to
the sale or other disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement, and any prospectus so supplemented to be filed
pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, in accordance with the intended
methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof set forth in such
registration statement and (ii) provide notice to such sellers of Registrable
Securities and the Manager, if any, of the Companys reasonable determination
that a post-effective amendment to a registration statement would
be appropriate;

(c) furnish, without charge, to each Participating Holder and each
underwriter, if any, of the securities covered by such registration statement
such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and
supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits), the prospectus
included in such registration statement (including each preliminary
prospectus and any summary prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under
Rule 424 under the Securities Act, each free writing prospectus utilized in
connection therewith, in each case, in all material respects in conformity
with the requirements of the Securities Act, and other documents, as such
seller and underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
public sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such
seller (the Company hereby consenting to the use in accordance with all
applicable laws of each such registration statement (or amendment or post-
effective amendment thereto) and each such prospectus (or preliminary
prospectus or supplement thereto) or free writing prospectus by each
such Participating Holder and the underwriters, if any, in connection with
the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement or prospectus);

 

(d) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement under such
other securities or state "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any sellers
of Registrable Securities or any managing underwriter, if any, shall
reasonably request in writing, and do any and all other acts and things that
may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such sellers or
underwriter, if any, to consummate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities in such jurisdictions in accordance with the intended methods of
disposition (including keeping such registration or qualification in effect
for so long as such registration statement remains in effect), except that in
no event shall the Company be required to qualify to do business as a foreign
corporation in any jurisdiction where it would not, but for the requirements
of this paragraph (d), be required to be so qualified, to subject itself to
taxation in any such jurisdiction or to consent to general service of process
in any such jurisdiction;

 

(e) promptly notify each Participating Holder and each managing underwriter,
if any: (i) when the registration statement, any pre-effective amendment, the
prospectus or any prospectus supplement related thereto, any post-effective
amendment to the registration statement or any free writing prospectus has
been filed with the SEC and, with respect to the registration statement or
any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective; (ii) of any
request by the SEC or state securities authority for amendments or supplements
to the registration statement or the prospectus related thereto or for
additional information; (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement

 



17  or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (iv) of the receipt
by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the securities or
state "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding
for such purpose; (v) of the existence of any fact of which the Company
becomes aware that results in the registration statement or any amendment
thereto, the prospectus related thereto or any supplement thereto, any
document incorporated therein by reference, any free writing prospectus or the
information conveyed to any purchaser at the time of sale to such purchaser
containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statement
therein (other than with respect to a registration statement, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading (which notice
shall notify the Participating Holders only of the occurrence of such an event
and shall provide no additional information regarding such event to the extent
such information would constitute material non-public information); and (vi)
if at any time the representations and warranties contemplated by any
underwriting agreement, securities sale agreement, or other
similar agreement, relating to the offering shall cease to be true and
correct; and, if the notification relates to an event described in clause (v),
unless the Company has declared that a Postponement Period exists, the Company
shall promptly prepare and furnish to each such seller and each underwriter,
if any, a reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or amended
so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable
Securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made not misleading;

 

(f) comply (and continue to comply) in all material respects with all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make generally available to
its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective
date of the registration statement (and in any event within forty-five (45)
days, or ninety (90) days if it is a fiscal year, after the end of
such twelve month period described hereafter), an earnings statement (which
need not be audited) covering the period of at least twelve (12) consecutive
months beginning with the first day of the Companys first calendar quarter
after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings
statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act
and Rule 158 thereunder;

 

(g) cause all such Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement to be listed on the principal securities exchange on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed (if any), if the listing of
such Registrable Securities is then permitted under the rules of such
exchange;

 

(h) in connection with any underwritten offering, cause its senior management,
other employees and independent public accountants (in the case of the
independent public accountants, subject to any applicable accounting guidance
regarding their participation in the offering or the due diligence process)
and other experts to participate in, make themselves available at reasonable
times upon reasonable request, supply such information as may reasonably be
requested and to otherwise facilitate and cooperate with the preparation of
the registration statement and prospectus and any amendments or supplements
thereto (including participating in meetings, drafting sessions and due
diligence sessions) taking into account the Companys reasonable business
needs;

 



18 (i) in connection with any underwritten offering, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to make available at reasonable times upon reasonable
request its senior management and other employees for participation in "road

to the underwriters (taking into account the Companys reasonable business
needs and the requirements of the marketing process) in the marketing of
Registrable Securities;

 

(j) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all
such Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement not later
than the effective date of such registration statement and, in the case of any
secondary equity offering, provide and enter into any reasonable agreements
with a custodian for the Registrable Securities;

 

(k) enter into such customary agreements (including, if applicable, an
underwriting agreement) and take such other actions as the Initiating Holder
or the Majority Participating Holders or the underwriters shall reasonably
request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities (it being understood that the Holders of the Registrable Securities
that are to be distributed by any underwriters shall be parties to any such
underwriting agreement);

(l) in connection with any underwritten offering, use its commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to obtain opinions from the Companys counsel,
including local counsel, and a "cold comfort" letter, updates thereof and
consents from the independent public accountants who have certified the
financial statements of the Company (and/or any other financial statements)
included or incorporated by reference in the applicable registration
statement, in each case, in customary form and covering such matters as
are customarily covered by such opinions and "cold comfort" letters
(including, in the case of such "cold comfort" letter, events subsequent to
the date of such financial statements) delivered to underwriters in
underwritten public offerings, which opinions and letters shall be dated the
dates such opinions and "cold comfort" letters are customarily dated and
otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the underwriters, (ii) to obtain
customary letters from the Companys reserve valuation experts addressed to
the underwriters and (iii) to furnish to each Participating Holder upon its
request and to each underwriter, if any, copies of such opinions and letters
addressed to such underwriter;

Participating Holders and to each managing underwriter, if any, copies of all
correspondence between the SEC and the Company, its counsel or independent
public accountants relating to discussions with the SEC or its staff with
respect to the registration statement, and, upon receipt of such
confidentiality agreements as the Company may reasonably request, make
reasonably available for inspection by counsel for the Participating Holders,
by counsel for any underwriter participating in any disposition to be effected
pursuant to such registration statement and by any attorney, accountant or
other agent retained by the Participating Holders or any such underwriter, all
pertinent financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and
properties of the

 



19  Company as may reasonably be requested, and cause the Companys officers and
other employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
counsel for the Participating Holders, counsel for an underwriter, attorney,
accountant or agent in connection with such registration statement;

(n) use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance or obtain
the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of the registration
statement, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification of any of the
Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, in each case, as
promptly as reasonably practicable;

(o) provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities, not later than the
effective date of the registration statement and, if applicable, provide the
applicable transfer agent with printed certificates for the Registrable
Securities which are in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust
Company;

 

(p) cooperate with the Participating Holders and the managing underwriter, if
any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (or
book-entry designations) not bearing any restrictive legends representing the
Registrable Securities to be sold, and cause such Registrable Securities to be
issued in such denominations and registered in such names in accordance with
the underwriting agreement at least one (1) Business Day prior to any sale of
Registrable Securities to the underwriters or, if not an underwritten
offering, in accordance with the instructions of the Participating Holders at
least one (1) Business Day prior to any sale of Registrable Securities and
instruct any transfer agent and registrar of Registrable Securities to release
any stop transfer orders in respect thereof (and, in the case of Registrable
Securities registered on a Shelf Registration Statement, at the request of
any Holder, prepare and deliver certificates (or book-entry designations)
representing such Registrable Securities not bearing any restrictive legends
and deliver or cause to be delivered an opinion or instructions to the
transfer agent in order to allow such Registrable Securities to be sold from
time to time);

(q) take no direct or indirect action prohibited by Regulation M under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that any prohibition
is applicable to the Company, the Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to make any such prohibition inapplicable;

(r) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities covered by the applicable registration statement to be registered
with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be
necessary to enable the Participating Holders or the underwriters, if any, to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with
the intended methods thereof;

(s) take all such other commercially reasonable actions as are necessary
or advisable in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities;

(t) take all reasonable action to ensure that any free writing prospectus
utilized in connection with any registration covered by Section 2.1 or 2.2
complies in all material respects with the Securities Act, is filed in
accordance with the Securities Act to the extent required 

 



20  thereby, is retained in accordance with the Securities Act to the extent
required thereby, will not conflict with a related prospectus, prospectus
supplement and related documents and, when taken together with the related
prospectus, prospectus supplement and related documents, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading;

(u) in connection with any underwritten offering, if at any time the
information conveyed to a purchaser at the time of sale includes any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, promptly file with the SEC such
amendments or supplements to such information as may be necessary so that the
statements as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the
circumstances, be misleading;

 

(v) in connection with any underwritten offering, to the extent required by
the rules and regulations of FINRA, retain a Qualified
Independent Underwriter reasonably acceptable to the Manager; and

(w) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with any
managing underwriters, their counsel, the Participating Holders and counsel
for the Participating Holders in connection with the preparation and filing of
any applications, notices, registrations and responses to requests for
additional information with FINRA, the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq
Stock Market, or any other national securities exchange on which the Shares
are or are to be listed.

 

To the extent the Company is a WKSI at the time any Demand Registration
Request is submitted to the Company, and such Demand Registration Request
requests that the Company file an automatic shelf registration statement (as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) (an " _automatic shelf
registration statement_ ") on Form S-3, the Company shall file an automatic
shelf registration statement that covers those Registrable Securities that are
requested to be registered. To the extent the Company has filed an automatic
shelf registration statement, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to remain a WKSI (and not become an ineligible issuer (as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act)) during the period during which
such automatic shelf registration statement is required to remain effective.
If the Company is requested to register Registrable Securities on an
automatic shelf registration statement, the Company shall pay the applicable
filing fee related to such Registrable Securities at the time of filing of the
automatic shelf registration statement. If the automatic shelf registration
statement has been outstanding for at least three (3) years, at or prior to
the end of the third year the Company shall, upon request, refile a new
automatic shelf registration statement covering the Registrable Securities
that remain outstanding. If at any time when the Company is required to re-
evaluate its WKSI status the Company determines that it is not a WKSI, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to refile the shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 and, if such form is not available, Form
S-1 and keep such registration statement effective during the period during
which such registration statement is required to be kept effective.

 



21 If the Company files any shelf registration statement for the benefit of the
holders of any of its securities other than the Holders, and the Holders do
not request that their Registrable Securities be included in such Shelf
Registration Statement, the Company agrees that it shall include in such
registration statement such disclosures as may be required by Rule 430B under
the Securities Act (referring to the unnamed selling security holders in a
generic manner by identifying the initial offering of the securities to the
Holders) in order to ensure that the Holders may be added to such shelf
registration statement at a later time through the filing of a prospectus
supplement rather than a post-effective amendment.

The Company may require as a condition to the Companys obligations under
this Section 2.4 that each Participating Holder as to which any registration
is being effected (i) furnish the Company such information regarding such
seller and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time
to time reasonably request, provided that such information is necessary for
the Company to consummate such registration and shall be used only in
connection with such registration and (ii) provide any underwriters
participating in the distribution of such securities such information as the
underwriters may request and execute and deliver any agreements, certificates
or other documents as the underwriters may request.

 

Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees that upon receipt of any notice
from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
clause (v) of paragraph (e) of this Section 2.4, such Holder will discontinue
such Holders disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the
registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until
such Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by paragraph (e) of this Section 2.4 and, if so directed by the
Company, will deliver to the Company (at the Companys expense) all
copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Holders possession of
the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that was in effect at the
time of receipt of such notice. In the event the Company shall give any such
notice, the applicable period mentioned in paragraph (b) of this Section 2.4
shall be extended by the number of days during such period from and including
the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when each
Participating Holder covered by such registration statement shall have
received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by
paragraph (e) of this Section 2.4. The period(s) during which the Holders are
required to discontinue disposition of securities pursuant to this paragraph
shall not exceed forty-five (45) days with respect to any one such period
within any 365 day period (either alone or in combination with a Postponement
Period pursuant to Section 2.1(b) hereof).

To the extent that any Holder is or may be deemed to be an "underwriter" of
Registrable Securities pursuant to any SEC comments or policies, the Company
agrees that such Holder shall be entitled to conduct the due diligence that an
underwriter would normally conduct in connection with an offering of
securities registered under the Securities Act, including without limitation
receipt of customary opinions and comfort letters addressed to such Holder (to
the extent permitted by applicable accounting or auditing guidance).

 



22 2.5. _Registration Expenses_.

 

(a) The Company shall pay all Expenses with respect to any registration or
offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2, whether or not a
registration statement becomes effective or the offering is consummated.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the provisions of this Section 2.5
shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to cause these expense
provisions to comply with state "blue sky" laws of each state in which the
offering is made, and (y) in connection with any underwritten offering
hereunder, each Participating Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and
commissions and any transfer taxes, if any, attributable to the sale of such
Registrable Securities, pro rata with respect to payments of discounts and
commissions in accordance with the number of Shares sold in the offering by
such Holder. In addition, each Participating Holder shall pay the expenses of
its own counsel and advisors, except to the extent provided in the definition
of "Expenses".

2.6. _Certain Limitations on Registration Rights_. In the case of any
registration under Section 2.1 involving an underwritten offering, or, in the
case of a registration under Section 2.2, if the Company has determined to
enter into an underwriting agreement in connection therewith, all securities
to be included in such underwritten offering shall be subject to such
underwriting agreement and no Person may participate in such underwritten
offering unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Persons securities on the
basis provided therein and completes and executes all reasonable
questionnaires and other documents (including custody agreements and powers of
attorney, if any) that must be executed in connection therewith; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all such documents shall be consistent with the provisions
hereof and (ii) provides such other information to the Company or the
underwriter as may be necessary to register such Persons securities.

 

2.7. _Limitations on Sale or Distribution of Other Securities_.

 

(a) Each Holder agrees (whether or not such Holder can participate in any such
offering), (i) to the extent requested by a managing underwriter, if any, of
any underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration or offering
effected pursuant to Section 2.1 (including any Shelf Underwriting pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)), not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, including any
sale pursuant to Rule 144, any Shares or Share Equivalents (other than as part
of such underwritten public offering) during the time period reasonably
requested by the managing underwriter, not to exceed ninety (90) days
from the pricing date of such offering or such shorter period as the managing
underwriter, the Company or any executive officer or director of the Company
shall agree to (and the Company hereby also so agrees (except that the Company
may effect any sale or distribution of any such securities pursuant to a
registration on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor or other forms
promulgated for similar purposes or forms filed in connection with an
exchange offer or any employee benefit or stock purchase and/or dividend
reinvestment plan), to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
directors and executive officers of the Company, to so agree), and (ii) to
the extent requested by a managing underwriter of any underwritten public
offering effected by the Company for its own account (including without
limitation any offering in which one or more Holders is selling Shares
pursuant to the 

 



23  exercise of piggyback rights under Section 2.2 hereof), not to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of, including any sale pursuant to Rule 144, any
Shares or Share Equivalents (other than as part of such underwritten public
offering) during the time period reasonably requested by the managing
underwriter, which period shall not exceed ninety (90) days from the pricing
date of such offering or such shorter period as the managing underwriter, the
Company or any executive officer or director of the Company shall agree to.
Each Holder agrees to execute and deliver customary lock-up agreements for the
benefit of the underwriters with such form and substance as the managing
underwriter shall reasonably determine.

(b) The Company hereby agrees that, in connection with an offering pursuant
to Section 2.1 (including any Shelf Underwriting pursuant to Section 2.1(e))
or Section 2.2, the Company shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of,
any Shares or Share Equivalents (other than as part of such underwritten
public offering, a registration on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor or
other forms promulgated for similar purposes or forms filed in connection
with an exchange offer or any employee benefit or stock purchase and/or
dividend reinvestment plan), until a period of ninety (90) days (or such
shorter period to which the Majority Participating Holders shall agree) shall
have elapsed from the pricing date of such offering, except to the extent
otherwise agreed to by the underwriters as provided in any lock-up agreement
required in connection with such offering; and the Company shall (i) so
provide in any registration rights agreements hereafter entered into with
respect to any of its securities and (ii) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all directors and executive officers of the Company to
so agree.

2.8. _No Required Sale_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create
an independent obligation on the part of any Holder to sell any Registrable
Securities pursuant to any effective registration statement. A Holder is not
required to include any of its Registrable Securities in any registration
statement, is not required to sell any of its Registrable Securities that are
included in any effective registration statement, may sell any of its
Registrable Securities in any manner in compliance with applicable law
(including pursuant to Rule 144) even if such shares are already included on
an effective registration statement, and may request that Registrable
Securities be registered or sold pursuant to a registration statement even if
such Shares are eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144.

 

2.9. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) In the event of any registration or offer and sale of any securities of
the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to this Section 2, the Company
will (without limitation as to time), and hereby agrees to, and hereby does,
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each
Participating Holder, its directors, officers, fiduciaries,
employees, stockholders, members, general and limited partners, affiliates,
successors and assigns (and the directors, officers, fiduciaries, employees,
stockholders, members, general and limited partners, affiliates, successors
and assigns thereof), and each other Person, if any, who controls (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act)
any such Participating Holder and each director, officer, employee,
stockholder, fiduciary, managing director, affiliate, successor, assign or
partner of such controlling Person (and all controlling

 



24  Persons of any such Persons or other controlling Persons), from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, actions
or proceedings (whether commenced or threatened) and expenses (including
reasonable fees of counsel and any amounts paid in any settlement effected
with the Companys consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) to which each such indemnified party may become subject under the
Securities Act or otherwise in respect thereof (collectively, " _Claims_ "),
insofar as such Claims arise out of, are based upon, relate to or are in
connection with (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any registration statement under which such
securities were registered under the Securities Act or the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
preliminary, final or summary prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein, or
any free writing prospectus utilized in connection therewith, or the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) any
violation by the Company of any federal, state or common law rule or
regulation applicable to the Company and relating to any action required of
or inaction by the Company in connection with any such offering of Registrable
Securities, and the Company will reimburse any such indemnified party for any
documented legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim as such
expenses are incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
liable to any such indemnified party in any such case to the extent such Claim
arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material
fact made in such registration statement or amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or in any such prospectus or any preliminary, final or summary
prospectus or free writing prospectus in reliance upon and in strict
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf
of such indemnified party specifically for use therein. Such indemnity and
reimbursement of expenses shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of such indemnified party and shall
survive the transfer of such securities by such seller.

 

(b) Each Participating Holder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and
hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in
paragraph (a) of this Section 2.9) to the extent permitted by law the Company,
its officers who signed the applicable registration statement and its
directors, each Person controlling the Company within the meaning of
the Securities Act and each director, officer, employee, stockholder,
fiduciary, managing director, affiliate, successor, assign or partner of such
controlling Person (and all controlling Persons of any such Persons or other
controlling Persons) with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact in, or omission or alleged omission of any
material fact from, such registration statement, any preliminary, final or
summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
or any free writing prospectus utilized in connection therewith, if such
statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in
reliance upon and in strict conformity with written information furnished to
the Company or its representatives by or on behalf of such Participating
Holder specifically for use therein, and each such Participating Holder, shall
reimburse such indemnified party for any legal 

 



25  or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any such Claim as such expenses are
incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate amount that any such
Participating Holder shall be required to pay pursuant to this Section 2.9
(including pursuant to indemnity, contribution or otherwise) shall in no case
be greater than the amount of the net proceeds actually received by such
Participating Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to
the registration statement giving rise to such Claim; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that such Participating Holder shall not be liable in any such case to the
extent that prior to the filing of any such registration statement or
prospectus or amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any free writing
prospectus utilized in connection therewith, such Participating Holder has
furnished in writing to the Company information expressly for use in such
registration statement or prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or free writing prospectus which corrected or made not misleading
information previously furnished to the Company. The Company and each
Participating Holder hereby acknowledge and agree that, unless otherwise
expressly agreed to in writing by such Participating Holders to the contrary,
for all purposes of this Agreement, the only information furnished or to be
furnished to the Company for use in any such registration statement,
preliminary, final or summary prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto,
or any free writing prospectus, are statements specifically relating to (i)
the beneficial ownership of Shares by such Participating Holder and its
Affiliates as disclosed in the section of such document entitled "Selling
Shareholders" or "Principal and Selling Shareholders" or other variations
thereof and (ii) the name and address of such Participating Holder. If any
additional information about such Holder or the plan of distribution (other
than for an underwritten offering) is required by law to be disclosed in any
such document, then such Holder shall not unreasonably withhold its agreement
referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. Such indemnity and
reimbursement of expenses shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of such indemnified party and shall
survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder.

(c) Indemnification similar to that specified in the preceding paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 2.9 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by
the Company and each Participating Holder with respect to any required
registration or other qualification of securities under any applicable
securities and state "blue sky" laws.

(d) Any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement shall
notify promptly the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of any
action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be
made pursuant to this Section 2.9, but the failure of any indemnified party to
provide such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its
obligations under the preceding paragraphs of this Section 2.9, except to the
extent the indemnifying party is materially and actually prejudiced thereby
and shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may
have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 2.9. In case
any action or proceeding is brought against an indemnified party and such
indemnified party shall have notified the indemnifying party of the
commencement thereof (as required above), the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate therein and, unless in the reasonable opinion of
outside counsel to the indemnified party a conflict of interest between
such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such Claim,
to assume the defense thereof jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified, to the

 



26  extent that it chooses, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party that it so chooses, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) if the indemnifying party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to
defend diligently the action or proceeding within thirty (30) days after
receiving notice from such indemnified party that the indemnified party
believes it has failed to do so; (ii) if such indemnified party who is a
defendant in any action or proceeding that is also brought against the
indemnifying party reasonably shall have concluded that there may be one or
more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified party that are
not available to the indemnifying party or that may conflict with or are
different from those available to another indemnified party with respect to
such Claim; or (iii) if representation of both parties by the same counsel is
otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct,
then, in any such case, the indemnified party shall have the right to assume
or continue its own defense and the indemnifying party shall be liable for
any expenses therefor. No indemnifying party shall, without the written
consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or
threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or
contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is
an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment (A) includes an unconditional release of the
indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and
(B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability
or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

(e) If for any reason the foregoing indemnity is unavailable, unenforceable or
is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 2.9(a),
(b) or (c), then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable to such indemnified party as a result of any Claim in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other
hand, with respect to such Claim. The relative fault shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the
indemnified party and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or
omission. If, however, the allocation provided in the second preceding
sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative faults but
also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party
as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The parties hereto
agree that it would not be just and equitable if any contribution pursuant to
this Section 2.9(e) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation that does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in the preceding sentences of this
Section 2.9(e). The amount paid or payable in respect of any Claim shall be
deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
Claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)

 



27  shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.9(e)
to the contrary, no indemnifying party (other than the Company) shall be
required pursuant to this Section 2.9(e) to contribute any amount greater than
the amount of the net proceeds received by such indemnifying party from the
sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement giving
rise to such Claim, less the amount of any indemnification payment made by
such indemnifying party pursuant to Sections 2.9(b) and (c). In addition, no
Holder of Registrable Securities or any Affiliate thereof shall be required
to pay any amount under this Section 2.9(e) unless such Person or entity would
have been required to pay an amount pursuant to Section 2.9(b) if it had been
applicable in accordance with its terms.

 

(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained herein shall be in
addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made or
omitted by or on behalf of any indemnified party and shall survive the
transfer of the Registrable Securities by any such party.

(g) The indemnification and contribution required by this Section 2.9 shall be
made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the
investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss,
damage or liability is incurred; provided, however, that the recipient thereof
hereby undertakes to repay such payments if and to the extent it shall be
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such recipient is not
entitled to such payment hereunder.

 

2.10. _Limitations on Registration of Other Securities; Representation_. From
and after the date of this Agreement, for so long as the Registrable
Securities beneficially owned by the Shareholders constitute at least ten
percent (10%) of the outstanding Shares, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Shareholders, enter into any agreement with any
holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company giving such
holder or prospective holder any registration rights the terms of which are
(i) more favorable taken as a whole than the registration rights granted to
the Holders hereunder unless the Company shall also give such rights to such
Holders or (ii) on parity with the registration rights granted to the Holders
hereunder.

 

2.11. _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Company shall not hereafter enter into
any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent in any
material respects with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement.

Section 3\. _Underwritten Offerings_.

3.1. _Requested Underwritten Offerings_. If requested by the underwriters for
any underwritten offering pursuant to a registration requested under Section
2.1, the Company shall enter into a customary underwriting agreement with the
underwriters. Such underwriting agreement shall (i) be reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to the Majority Participating Holders, (ii) contain
terms not materially inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement to

 



28  the extent the underwriters of such offering agree to such terms and (iii)
contain such representations and warranties by, and such other agreements on
the part of, the Company and such other terms as are customary and generally
prevailing in agreements of that type, including, without limitation,
indemnities and contribution agreements as are customary for the lead
underwriter for such offering and agreed to by the Majority Participating
Holders. Any Participating Holder shall be a party to such underwriting
agreement and may, at its option, require that any or all of the
representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of,
the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to
and for the benefit of such Participating Holder and that any or all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of such
Participating Holder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to make any representations or warranties with respect to written
information specifically provided by a Participating Holder for inclusion in
the registration statement. Unless otherwise agreed by the Majority
Participating Holders and the underwriters, each such Participating Holder
shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or
agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such Participating Holder, its ownership of
and title to the Registrable Securities, any written information specifically
provided by such Participating Holder for inclusion in the registration
statement and its intended method of distribution; and any liability of such
Participating Holder to any underwriter or other Person under such
underwriting agreement for indemnity, contribution or otherwise shall in no
case be greater than the amount of the net proceeds received by such
Participating Holder upon the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
underwriting agreement and in no event shall relate to anything other than
information about such Holder specifically provided by such Holder for use in
the registration statement and prospectus (in each case unless otherwise
agreed by the underwriters and the Majority Participating Holders).

 

3.2. _Piggyback Underwritten Offerings_. In the case of a registration
pursuant to Section 2.2, if the Company shall have determined to enter into
an underwriting agreement in connection therewith, all of the Participating
Holders Registrable Securities to be included in such registration shall be
subject to such underwriting agreement. Any Participating Holder shall be
a party to such underwriting agreement and may, at its option, require that
any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements
on the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall
also be made to and for the benefit of such Participating Holder and that any
or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters
under such underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations
of such Participating Holder;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be required to make any representations or warranties with respect
to written information specifically provided by a Participating Holder for
inclusion in the registration statement. Unless otherwise agreed by the
Majority Participating Holders and the underwriters, each such Participating
Holder shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or
agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such Participating Holder, its ownership of
and title to the Registrable Securities, any written information specifically
provided by such Participating Holder for inclusion in the
registration statement and its intended method of distribution; and any
liability of such Participating Holder to any

 



29  underwriter or other Person under such underwriting agreement shall in no
case be greater than the amount of the net proceeds received by such
Participating Holder upon the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
underwriting agreement and in no event shall relate to anything other than
information about such Holder specifically provided by such Holder for use in
the registration statement and prospectus (in each case unless otherwise
agreed by the underwriters and Majority Participating Holders).

Section 4\. _General_.

 

4.1. _Rule_ __ _ 144 and Rule_ __ _ 144A_. The Company covenants that (i) so
long as it remains subject to the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act,
it will use commercially reasonable efforts to timely file the reports
required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act (including, but not limited
to, the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to
in subparagraph (c)(1)(i) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule
may be amended (" _Rule_ __ _ 144_")) or, if the Company is not required to
file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder, make publicly
available other information so long as necessary to permit sales by such
Holder under Rule 144, Rule 144A under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be
amended (" _Rule_ __ _ 144A_"), or any similar rules or regulations
hereafter adopted by the SEC, and (ii) it will take such further action as any
Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time
to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration
under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by
(A) Rule 144, (B) Rule 144A or (C) any similar rule or regulation
hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the reasonable request of any Holder of
Registrable Securities, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written
statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. To the extent
any Holder desires to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144, the
Company agrees to provide customary instructions to the transfer agent to
remove any restrictive legends from such Shares and to provide or cause any
customary opinions of counsel to be delivered to the transfer agent in
connection with any such sale. In addition, the Company agrees to remove any
restrictive legend from the Registrable Securities upon the reasonable request
of any Holder as soon as reasonably permitted by applicable law and customary
practice (including customary transfer agent practices).

4.2. _Nominees for Beneficial Owners_. If Registrable Securities are held by
a nominee for the beneficial owner thereof, the beneficial owner thereof may,
at its option, be treated as the Holder of such Registrable Securities for
purposes of any request or other action by any Holder or Holders of
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement (or any determination of
any number or percentage of shares constituting Registrable Securities held by
any Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall have received
assurances reasonably satisfactory to it of such beneficial ownership.

4.3.  _Amendments and Waivers_. For three years following the date hereof, no
provision of this Agreement may be amended or modified unless such amendment
or modification is approved by a majority of the Foxtrot Independent Directors
(as defined in the Stockholders Agreement, dated as of [●], by and among the
Company, SCR-Sibelco NV and

 



30  the other stockholders of the Company party thereto) or by the sole Foxtrot
Independent Director, so long as at least one Foxtrot Independent Director is
a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. Additionally, except as
otherwise provided herein, no modification, amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement shall be effective against the Company or any
Holder unless such modification, amendment or waiver is approved in writing
by the Company and such Holder. No waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other
provision hereof (whether or not similar). No failure or delay on the part of
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof or of any other or future exercise of any such right,
power or privilege.

 

4.4. _Notices_. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of
receipt); (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally
recognized overnight courier (receipt requested); (c) on the date sent by
facsimile or email of a PDF document (with confirmation of transmission) if

4.5. _Successors and Assigns_. Except as otherwise provided herein, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and the respective successors, permitted
assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the parties hereto, whether so
expressed or not. This Agreement may not be assigned by the Company without
the prior written consent of the Shareholders. No Holder shall have the right
to assign all or part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; provided,
that any Holder may assign this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any Holder
may assign this Agreement to one or more third parties who acquire Shares from
such Holder other than in a public underwritten offering or sales generally
into the open market pursuant to Rule 144 so long as the Shares being acquired
by such third party or parties has an aggregate market value of at least the
Minimum Threshold; provided, further, that such Holders Affiliate (or
Affiliates) or other permitted transferee executes and delivers to the Company
an Assumption Agreement. Upon any such assignment, such assignee shall have
and be able to exercise and enforce all rights of the assigning Holder that
are assigned to it and, to the extent such rights are assigned, any reference
to the assigning Holder shall be treated as a reference to the assignee. If
any Holder shall acquire additional Registrable Securities, such Registrable
Securities shall be subject to all of the terms, and entitled to all the
benefits, of this Agreement.

4.6. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other documents referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto that form part hereof constitute the
entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto, and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter
hereof.

4.7. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This 

 



32  Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than those of the State of New York.

 

Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based upon this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought
in the federal or state courts located in the State of New York, and each
party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection
to the laying of venue of any suit, action or any proceeding in any such court
and irrevocably waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Service of process, summons, notice or other
document by certified or registered mail to such partys address set forth
herein shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or other
proceeding brought in any such court.

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND,
THEREFORE, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL
ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 4.8.

4.8. _Interpretation; Construction_. 

(a) The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, do
not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this
Agreement is made to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. 

 



33 4.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered in any
number of separate counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail),
each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same agreement.

 

4.10. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

4.11. _Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without the posting
of any bond, and, if any action should be brought in equity to enforce any of
the provisions of this Agreement, none of the parties hereto shall raise the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. All remedies, either under
this Agreement, by law, or otherwise afforded to any party, shall be
cumulative and not alternative.

 

4.12. _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto shall do and perform or cause to
be done and performed all such further acts and things and shall execute and
deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments, and documents as
any other party hereto reasonably may request in order to carry out the intent
and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.13. _Confidentiality_. Each Holder agrees that any non-public information
that such Holder may receive relating to the Company and its subsidiaries
pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Confidential Information_ ") will be held
strictly confidential and will not be disclosed by it to any Person without
the express written permission of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Confidential Information may be disclosed (i) in the event of any
compulsory legal process or compliance with any applicable law, subpoena or
other legal process or in connection with any filings that the Holder may be
required to make with any regulatory authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the event of compulsory legal process, unless prohibited by applicable law
or that process, each Holder agrees (A) to give the Company prompt notice
thereof and to cooperate with the Company in securing a protective order in
the event of compulsory disclosure and (B) that any disclosure made pursuant
to public filings will be subject to the prior reasonable review

 



34  of the Company, (ii) to any foreign or domestic governmental or quasi-
governmental regulatory authority, including without limitation, any stock
exchange or other self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction over such
party, (iii) to each Holders or its Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors, employees, partners, accountants, lawyers and other
professional advisors for use relating solely to management of the investment
or administrative purposes with respect to such Holder or Affiliate thereof,
and (iv) to each Holders or its Affiliates direct or indirect partners,
members or investors, or potential partners, members or investors and their
respective advisors, provided that such Holder or its applicable Affiliate
informs such Person that such information is confidential and directs such
Person to use such information only for purpose of assisting in determining
whether to invest in, or monitoring, modifying or exiting its investment in,
the Company (or a Holder, Affiliate of a Holder or a direct or indirect owner
of a Holder).

 

4.14. _Restructuring_. To the extent that the Board of the Company elects to
effect a restructuring or recapitalization of the Company or substantially
all of the business of the Company through a subsidiary or parent company of
the Company or otherwise, the provisions of this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted, and the Holders and the Company shall enter into such
further agreements and arrangements as shall be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to provide the Holders with substantially the same registration
rights as they would have under this Agreement, giving due consideration to
the nature of the new public entity, the nature of the securities to be
offered and tax and other relevant considerations.

4.15.  _Opt-Out Rights_. Each Holder shall have the right, at any time and
from time to time (including after receiving information regarding any
potential public offering), to elect to not receive any notice that the
Company or any other Holders otherwise are required to deliver pursuant to
this Agreement by delivering to the Company a written statement signed by such
Holder that it does not want to receive any notices hereunder (an " _Opt-Out
Request_"); in which case and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement the Company and other Holders shall not be required to, and shall
not, deliver any notice or other information required to be provided to
Holders hereunder to the extent that the Company or such other Holders
reasonably expect would result in a Holder acquiring material non-public
information within the meaning of Regulation FD promulgated under the
Exchange Act. An Opt-Out Request may state a date on which it expires or, if
no such date is specified, shall remain in effect indefinitely. A Holder who
previously has given the Company an Opt-Out Request may revoke such request
at any time, and there shall be no limit on the ability of a Holder to issue
and revoke subsequent Opt-Out Requests; provided that each Holder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the administrative burden on the
Company arising in connection with any such Opt-Out Requests.

THE TRANSACTION

 

Section 2.1 Contribution of Transferred Assets. The Transferor hereby

exist thereon.

Section 2.2 Assumption of Assumed Liabilities. The Transferor hereby assigns
and transfers (collectively, the _Assignment_ ) to the Transferee the Assumed
Liabilities. The Transferee hereby accepts the Assignment and assumes and
agrees to pay or otherwise perform or discharge, when due, all of the Assumed
Liabilities.

Section 2.3 Value of Capital Contribution. The Transferred Assets are
contributed to, and the Assumed Liabilities are assumed from, the Transferee
at their Fair Market Value.

Agreement (the  _Closing_ ) will be deemed to take place at the offices of
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY

is referred to in this Agreement as the _Closing Date_.

Section 2.5 Share Issuance. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

exchange for [●] shares of Transferor Common Stock held by Sibelco, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Redemption Agreement.

 

Section 2.7 Consents.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement does
not constitute an agreement to sell, convey, assign, assume, transfer or
deliver any interest in any Transferred Asset, or any claim, right, benefit or
obligation arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if a sale, conveyance,
assignment, assumption, transfer or delivery, or an attempt to make such a
sale, conveyance, assignment, assumption, transfer or delivery, without the
consent of a third party would (i) constitute a breach or other contravention
of any Applicable Law or the rights of such third party, (ii) be ineffective
with respect to any party to a Contract concerning such Transferred Asset or
(iii) upon transfer, in any way adversely affect the rights of the Transferee
under such Transferred Asset. If the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or
delivery by the Transferor to the Transferee of any interest in, or
assumption by the Transferee of any liabilities or obligations under, any
Transferred Asset requires the consent of a third party, or, with respect to
Transferred Contracts, a novation approved by the relevant Governmental
Authority or consent of the Contract counterparty, then such sale, conveyance,
assignment, transfer, delivery or assumption will be subject to such consent
or novation being obtained. Without limiting  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_, if any
Transferred Asset may not be assigned to the Transferee by reason of the
absence of any such consent, the Transferee will not be required to assume any
Assumed Liability arising under such Transferred Asset.

(b) If any consent in respect of an Transferred Asset has not been obtained on
or before the Closing Date, the Transferor will continue to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent as promptly as
practicable after the Closing until such time as such consent has been
obtained and to cooperate in any lawful and reasonable arrangement which will
provide the Transferee the benefits including any indemnities of any such
Transferred Asset. Once a consent for the sale, conveyance, assignment,
assumption, transfer and delivery of an Transferred Asset is obtained, the
Transferor will promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver such
Transferred Asset to the Transferee, and the Transferee will assume the
obligations under such Transferred Asset assigned to it from and after the
date of assignment to the Transferee. If and when such consents are obtained
or such other required actions have been taken, the transfer of such
Transferred Asset will be effected in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(c) The Transferor will hold in trust for and pay to the Transferee as
promptly as practicable upon receipt thereof all income, proceeds and other
monies received by the Transferor or any member of the Transferor Group in
connection with its use of any asset, claim, right or benefit (net of any
Taxes, reduced by any deductions available in connection therewith, and any
other costs imposed upon the Transferor Group) in connection with the
arrangements under this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. The Transferee will promptly
provide to the Transferor whatever cooperation is required or reasonably
requested for the Transferor to meet its obligations on a timely basis under
any Contract or in relation to any such asset, claim, right or benefit.

 



11 (d) The failure by the Transferor or the Transferee, as applicable, to obtain
any required consent in respect of any Transferred Asset on or before the
Closing Date will not relieve any Party from its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the Closing.

 

ARTICLE 3

comparable in the aggregate to each such Transferred Employees then existing

benefits (including, for purposes of vacation, severance and retirement
benefits), under any benefit plan in which such Transferred Employee
participates on or following the Closing Date to the same extent recognized
by the Transferor immediately prior to the Closing Date, except that such
service shall not be required to be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. The Transferee shall
cause (i) the waiver of all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any such welfare
benefit plans to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods would not apply under the Transferor Plans, and (ii) for the plan year
in which the Closing Date occurs (or, if later, in the calendar year in
which the Transferred Employees and their dependents commence participation
in the applicable Transferee welfare plans), the crediting of each Transferred
Employee with any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to participation in
such welfare plans in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements thereunder.

its commercially reasonable efforts to provide each other such employee

regulations in any applicable jurisdictions) or as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement, including, without limitation, for the purposes of
administering its employee benefit plans and policies.

Transferred Employee is entitled under any Applicable Law or any policy of
the Transferor or its Affiliates to be paid for any such accrued and unpaid
salary and overtime or accrued or earned but unused vacation time, sick time
and other paid time off benefits as of the Closing Date, Transferee shall
discharge the Liability for such payment in respect thereof.

Section 3.6 Accrued Bonuses; Long Term Incentive Plan. The Transferee shall
assume and honor all accrued annual bonus compensation in respect of each
Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date to the extent not already paid

Transferred Employees in a manner consistent with the applicable Transferor
annual bonus plan to which the relevant annual bonus accrual relates. In
addition, the Transferee shall assume and honor all accrued and unpaid cash
incentive awards under the Unimin Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan
(Revised May 27, 2014) in respect of the Transferred Employees as of the
Closing Date, and shall make payments to Transferred Employees in accordance
with the terms of such plan as in effect on the Closing Date (subject to
modification of the applicable performance goals as reasonably determined to
be necessary in good faith by the Transferee to reflect the transactions
contemplated hereunder) and any applicable payment elections previously made
by such Transferred Employees.

Section 3.7 Flexible Spending Arrangements. The Transferee agrees to cause a
flexible spending and dependent care reimbursement account plan of the
Transferee ( _Transferee_ __ _s Flex Plan_ ) to accept a spin-off of the
flexible spending and dependent care reimbursement accounts from the
Transferors flexible spending and dependent care reimbursement account
plan ( _Transferor_ __ _s Cafeteria Plan_ ) and to honor and continue
through the end of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs the
elections made by each Transferred Employee under the Transferors Cafeteria
Plan in respect of the flexible spending and dependent care reimbursement
accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. As of or as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, the Transferor shall cause to
be transferred from the Transferors Cafeteria Plan to the Transferees Flex
Plan the excess of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible
spending and dependent care reimbursement accounts made prior to the Closing
Date during the year in which the Closing Date occurs by Transferred
Employees over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made prior to the Closing
Date for such year from such accounts prior to the Closing Date to the
Transferred Employees. If the aggregate reimbursement payouts from the
flexible spending and dependent care reimbursement accounts made prior to the
Closing Date during the year in which the Closing Date occurs made to the
Transferred Employees exceed the aggregate accumulated contributions to such
accounts prior to the Closing Date for such year by the Transferred Employees,
Transferee shall cause such excess to be transferred to the Transferor as soon
as practicable following the Closing Date. On and after the Closing Date,
Transferee shall assume and be

 



13  solely responsible for all claims for reimbursement by the Transferred
Employees under the flexible spending and dependent care reimbursement
accounts of Transferors Cafeteria Plan, whether incurred prior to, on or
after the Closing Date, that have not been paid in full as of the Closing
Date.

 

Section 3.8 Tax-Qualified Defined Contribution/Profit Sharing Plans. The
Transferee shall take (or cause its Affiliates to take) any and all necessary
action to cause the trustee of a tax-qualified defined contribution/profit
sharing plan or plans of Transferee or one of its Affiliates, if requested to
do so by a Transferred Employee, to accept a direct "rollover" of all or a
portion of such Transferred Employees account balances (including any
outstanding loans) from Transferors or its Affiliates tax-qualified defined
contribution/profit sharing plan or plans, including any such plan that has a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of
the Code.

Section 3.9 Self-Insured Transferor Plan Liabilities. All liabilities arising
out of health or disability coverage claims incurred by or on behalf of any
Transferred Employee (or his or her covered dependents) under self-insured
Transferor Plans shall be reimbursed by the Transferee promptly following
receipt of written notice from the Transferor containing the specific
financial detail of the applicable claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Transferees Liability pursuant to the preceding sentence shall equal the
excess of (i) the amount of such claims incurred, over (ii) the aggregate
amount of premiums collected or paid from or on behalf of such Transferred
Employee for coverage under such self-insured Transferor Plans; _provided_
that the Transferees Liability for such claims shall not include any amount
of such claims that are paid under any stop-loss insurance policy in force
with respect to such Transferor Plan. For purposes of the foregoing, (i) a
health claim or Liability is deemed to be incurred upon the rendering
of health services giving rise to such claim or Liability, and (ii) a
disability claim or Liability is deemed to be incurred upon the date of
disability, as determined by the disability benefit claim administrator,
giving rise to such claim or Liability.

compensation liabilities relating to, arising out of, or resulting from any
claim by a Transferred Employee that results from an accident, incident or
event occurring, or from an occupational disease which becomes manifest as a
result of performing services for the Business shall be assumed by the
Transferee and covered by workers compensation insurance coverage to be
obtained by the Transferee. To the extent that the Transferee is unable to
cover any such liabilities under workers compensation insurance coverage to
be obtained by the Transferee, such liabilities will remain under the workers
compensation insurance coverage of the Transferor and the Transferee shall,
promptly following receipt of written notice from the Transferor containing
the specific financial detail of the applicable claim, reimburse the
Transferor for any such liabilities to the extent that the payment for such
liabilities are subject to a deductible under the applicable Transferor
insurance policy or exceed the coverage limits under the applicable Transferor
insurance policy or stop-loss coverage. Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Transferee will be responsible for obtaining workers compensation insurance,
including providing all collateral required by the insurance carriers and
providing all notices to Transferred Employees required by applicable workers
compensation laws and establishing new or transferred unemployment
insurance employer accounts, policies and claims handling contracts with the
applicable government agencies

 



14 Section 3.11 Company Car Leases. The Transferee shall assume and honor all
automobile leases and liabilities thereunder relating to automobiles leased by
the Transferor for the benefit of Transferred Employees as of the Closing
Date. To the extent that the Transferor is unable to assign, and

limitations of the applicable lease Contracts or otherwise, such automobile
leases will remain with the Transferor and the Transferee shall, on a monthly
basis and promptly following receipt of written notice from the Transferor
containing the specific financial detail of the applicable monthly lease
Liability, reimburse the Transferor for any such liabilities incurred under
such automobile leases.

 

Section 3.12 Employee Tax Matters. Transferor and its Affiliates and
Transferee shall adopt the "alternate procedure" for preparing and filing IRS

all actions that are legally required to assume each collective bargaining
agreement and all liabilities arising on or following the Closing Date
thereunder in respect of any Transferred Employees pursuant to each
collective bargaining agreement that covers any such Transferred Employees.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _ARTICLE 3_ , the Transferee
further agrees that the provisions of this  _ARTICLE 3_ shall be subject to
any applicable provisions of any collective bargaining agreement in respect of
the Transferred Employees, and to the extent that the provisions of this
_ARTICLE 3_ are inconsistent with or otherwise in conflict with the
provisions of any such collective bargaining agreement, the provisions of such
collective bargaining agreement shall govern and control. Without limiting the
generality of the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, effective as of the
Closing, the Transferred Employees covered by any collective bargaining
agreement assumed in the manner contemplated hereunder shall cease to be
employed by the Transferor and shall become the employees of the Transferee.
The Transferor and the Transferee shall cooperate in connection with any
required notification to the Transferred Employees, the representatives
thereof, the applicable unions or any relevant Governmental Authorities
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take such other
reasonable actions as determined in good faith by each of them to be necessary
to cause the provisions of this section to apply without limitation to the
maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law.

Section 3.14 No Obligation. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as
(i) requiring the Transferor or the Transferee to continue any specific
employee benefit plan, or (ii) an amendment to any compensation or benefit
plan or arrangement for any purpose. The Transferor and the
Transferee acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_ARTICLE 3_ are included for the sole benefit of the Transferor and the
Transferee, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied,
will create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (x) in any other
person, including any Transferred Employee or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, or (y) to continued employment with the Transferee for any specified
period of time following the Closing Date.

by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim (or
sooner, to the extent the nature of the Third Party Claim requires a response
in a shorter period of time); _provided that_ failure to give such
notice shall not affect the right to indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent the indemnifying Party shall have been materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the indemnifying Party, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following such Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all
written notices and documents (including any court papers) received by such
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

 

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
indemnifying Party shall be entitled (at its election) to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party by giving to the Indemnified Party, within twenty (20) days
of receipt of a written notice of the Third Party Claim, written notice of its
intention to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
nonetheless have the right to employ counsel separate from the counsel
employed by the indemnifying Party; _provided that _ the indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any fees of such separate
counsel with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim, unless the
engagement of such separate counsel is consented to by the indemnifying Party
in writing or in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, a conflict
or potential conflict exists between such Indemnified Party and the
indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation advisable. If
the indemnifying Party does not assume such defense, and for any period
during which the indemnifying Party has not assumed such defense, the
indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one
single counsel employed (and reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying Party)
by such Indemnified Party (which reasonable fees and expenses shall be
considered Losses for purposes of this Agreement). If the indemnifying Party
chooses to defend a Third Party Claim or prosecute a claim in connection
therewith, each Indemnified Party shall provide all necessary cooperation in
such defense or prosecution, including in making any counterclaim against the
Person asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any
Person (other than the indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying Party will not have any right
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim where such Third Party Claim (i)
seeks injunctive or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates or (ii) involves criminal allegations.

(c) If the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnifying Party may not settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_
, that the consent of the Indemnified Party will not be required if: (i) the
indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to
such settlement or any judgment; (ii) such settlement includes a full,
complete and unconditional written release of each Indemnified Party from
further Liability; (iii) except in any case where

 



17  court approval is needed of such a settlement, such settlement does not
include any statement as to or an admission of fact, culpability or a failure
to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates; and (iv)
such settlement does not in any manner involve any injunction or equitable
relief against any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. The Indemnified Party
will not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment (other than
a judgment of dismissal on the merits with prejudice and without costs)
arising from, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim against an indemnifying
Party under  _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.2_, as applicable,
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall
deliver notice of such claim to the indemnifying Party stating the amount of
the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed or arises, within twenty (20) Business Days of
becoming aware of the facts or circumstances giving rise to such claim;
_provided that_ failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying Party
shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
Indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party shall, for a period of not less
than twenty (20) Business Days following receipt by the indemnifying Party of
the notice of such claim, negotiate in good faith to resolve the claim, and
such Indemnified Party shall not commence proceedings with respect to such
claim prior to the end of such period.

 

Section 4.6 Exclusivity of Remedies. Following the Closing, (i) this _ARTICLE
4_ shall provide the exclusive remedy of the Transferee for any claim (other
than a claim with respect to Taxes) arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) pursuant to _ARTICLE 5_ , the Tax
Matters Agreement shall provide the exclusive remedy of the Transferee for
any claim with respect to Taxes arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the
part of any Party, after consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
to rescind this agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.7 Double Recovery. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
any amount pursuant to any provision of this Agreement in respect of any
claim to the extent such Indemnified Party has already recovered that amount
in respect of such claim under the same or any other provision of this
Agreement or pursuant to any other agreement with any Affiliate of the other
Indemnified Party, or to the extent that recovery has already been made under
this Agreement in respect of the same subject matter and in the amount of the
Loss claimed.

 

ARTICLE 5

liability for Taxes that become due and payable as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, rights to indemnification and
obligations to indemnify for Taxes, preparation and filing of Tax Returns,
control of audits, reviews, examinations, and other similar administrative
or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes and entitlement to refunds),
whether arising on, before, or after the Closing Date, will be governed by the

to the other Parties that it has all requisite corporate or equivalent power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is
made without any other representation or warranty.

Section 6.2 Further Assurances. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, from time to time, as and when requested by one Party of any
other Party, such other Party shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable and
at the requesting Partys expense, execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions, as such requesting Party

contemplated hereby and to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and the
allocation of Transferred Assets and Excluded Assets, on the one hand, and
Assumed Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities, on the other hand, as soon as

Assets to be conveyed, assigned or transferred to the Transferee at no
additional cost to the Transferee, or shall cause such Assumed Liabilities to
be assumed by the Transferee at no cost to the Transferor. In the event that

Transferor constituting Excluded Liabilities were erroneously assumed by the
Transferee at or prior to the Closing, it shall notify the other Party and

transferred back to the Transferor at no additional cost to the Transferor, or
shall cause such Excluded Liabilities to be assumed by the applicable
Transferor at no additional cost to the Transferee.

other amount in respect of any Excluded Asset, any asset of the Transferor or
any goods sold, or services provided, by the Transferor, the Transferee shall

payment or other amount, remit such payment or other amount to the
Transferor.

Section 6.4 Amendment and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended or
modified prior to the Effective Time (or the earlier termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms), or, except by an instrument in
writing, consented to in writing by each of the Parties (and subject to
approval by the Board of Directors of the Transferor (acting pursuant to
Section 2.3(a)(iii) of the Stockholders Agreement of the Transferor)),
thereafter. Each Party may (a) extend the time for performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this
Agreement, or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants or conditions for
the benefit of such Party contained in this Agreement _provided_  that (i)
any such extension or waiver by a Party will be valid only if set forth in a
written document signed on behalf of the Party against whom such extension or
waiver is to be effective; (ii) no extension or waiver will apply to any time
for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or noncompliance
with any covenant or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is
specified in the written extension or waiver; (iii) no failure or delay by a
Party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement or any of the
documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and no course of dealing
between the Parties, operates as a waiver of such right or remedy, and no
single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other or

 



21  further exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other right
or remedy; and (iv) after the Effective Time, the Transferor may only, in the
case of each of clauses (a), (b) and (c), act pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(iii)
of the Stockholders Agreement of the Transferor.

Section 6.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules hereto
and, solely to the extent referenced herein, the Merger Agreement) and the Tax
Matters Agreement contain the entire agreement and understanding between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings (whether oral or written) relating to such
subject matter. None of the Parties shall be liable or bound to any other
Party in any manner by any representations, warranties or covenants relating
to such subject matter except as specifically set forth herein or therein.

 

Section 6.6 Assignment, Successors and Third Party Rights. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of
law or otherwise, by any Party without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be
null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns and nothing
herein expressed or implied shall give, or be construed to give, to any
Person, other than the Parties and such successors and permitted assigns, any
legal or equitable right, remedies or claims under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provisions hereof.

Section 6.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. Upon a determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law in a mutually acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible. 

Section 6.8 Schedules. The Schedules identified in this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Agreement.

Section 6.9 Expenses. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
Transferor.

 

Section 6.10 Governing Law. This Agreement and all actions (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the actions of the Parties in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement thereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under any applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof

 

Section 6.11 Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were

 



22  not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court referred to  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ above, without
proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach.

Section 6.12 Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

(a) In any Action between the Parties arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Parties
(i) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in
and for New Castle County, Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State
of Delaware; (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court; and (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any such action in any court other than the
Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County,
Delaware, or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and appellate
courts thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process
outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_ in any such Action by mailing copies thereof by
registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.3_. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a Party to effect
service of process on any other Party by any other legally available method.

 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT.

 

Section 6.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered (including by electronic transmission) to the
other Parties.

the reorganization; (ii) the Distribution qualifies for non-recognition of
gain or loss, including under Sections 355 and 361 of the Code; and (iii)
neither the Contribution nor the Distribution will result in a FIRPTA Tax
(collectively, the "Tax-Free Status");

WHEREAS, the HPQ Business was conducted directly by Unimin prior to the

3\. Proration of Taxes for Straddle Periods. With respect to any Straddle
Period, Unimin and HPQ Co shall treat, and, if applicable, elect to treat the
close of the Distribution Date as the last day of the Tax Period. If no such
election is permitted, the Taxes for the Straddle Period shall be allocated to

number of days in such Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes, including Income Taxes, based upon an actual closing of the books
methodology, as determined in accordance with the relevant books and records;
_provided_ that, if the Distribution Date is not on a date for which there is

books methodology will be applied to ratably allocate Tax Items for the month
which includes the Distribution Date, except that any extraordinary Tax Items
shall be allocated to the Pre-Distribution and Post-Distribution Period on a
closing of the books basis (based on the principles of Treasury Regulation

this  _Section_ __ _ 4_, Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed when due
(including extensions) by the Person that is obligated to file such Tax
Returns under the Code or other applicable Tax Law (the "Filing Party"). 

4.2 _Preparation of Tax Returns._

 

(a) _General Rule._ Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)_, with
respect to any Tax Return for a Tax Period ending on or before the
Distribution Date or any Straddle Period, such Tax Return shall be prepared in
accordance with past practices, accounting methods, elections or conventions
("Past Practices") used with respect to the Tax Returns in question (unless
there is no reasonable basis for the use of such Past Practices or unless
there is no adverse effect (current or future) to Unimin), and to the extent
any items are not covered by Past Practices (or in the event that there is no
reasonable basis for the use of such Past Practices or there is no adverse
effect (current or future) to Unimin), in accordance with reasonable Tax
accounting practices selected by Unimin. Except as provided in  _Section_ __
_ 4.2(b)_, Unimin shall prepare any Tax Return for a Tax Period that begins
after the Distribution Date that it has the obligation or the right to prepare
and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, under  _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ in
accordance with reasonable Tax accounting practices selected by Unimin,
_provided_ that HPQ Co and Unimin may mutually agree in writing within 90 days
after the Spin-Off to change one or more of the tax accounting methods or
practices related to HPQ Co or the HPQ Business.

 

(b) _Reporting of Transactions._ The Tax treatment reported on any Tax Return
of Sibelco, Unimin, HPQ Co or any of their respective Affiliates that relates
to the Spin Off shall be consistent with the treatment thereof in the Tax
Opinion, except as otherwise required by applicable law. To the extent there
is a Tax treatment relating to the Spin-Off that is not covered by the Tax
Opinion, then the Tax treatment shall be determined by the Responsible Company
with respect to such Tax Return and the other Companies shall be deemed to
agree to such Tax treatment unless (i) there is no reasonable basis for such
Tax treatment, (ii) such Tax treatment is inconsistent with the Tax treatment
contemplated in the Tax Opinion, except as otherwise required by applicable
law, or (iii) more favorable Tax treatment is available, as confirmed by an
opinion of a Tax Advisor (which opinion and Tax Advisor shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Responsible Company). Any dispute regarding such proper Tax
treatment shall be referred for resolution pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14_,
sufficiently in advance of the filing date of such Tax Return

 



16  (including extensions) to permit timely filing of the Tax Return; _provided_
that, if the Tax Advisor is not able to render a final decision prior to the
due date for filing the applicable Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be
initially filed as prepared by the Responsible Company, but reflecting all
non-disputed comments provided by the other Companies, and, as promptly as
practicable after the Tax Advisor finally resolves the dispute, such Tax
Return shall be amended as necessary to reflect the determination of the Tax
Advisor.

 

4.3 _HPQ Co Carrybacks and Claims for Refund._ HPQ Co hereby agrees that,
unless Unimin consents in writing, (i) neither HPQ Co, nor any Affiliate of
HPQ Co, shall make or file any Adjustment Request with respect to any Unimin
Group Returns, and (ii) HPQ Co and its Affiliates shall make or file any
available elections to waive the right to claim any HPQ Co Carryback
arising in a Post-Distribution Period to any Pre-Distribution Period with
respect to any Unimin Group Returns, and neither HPQ Co, nor any Affiliate of
HPQ Co, shall make or file any affirmative election to claim any such HPQ Co
Carryback; _provided_ , _however_ , that HPQ Co and Unimin agree that any such
Adjustment Request shall be made with respect to any HPQ Co Carryback, upon
the reasonable request of HPQ Co, if such HPQ Co Carryback is necessary
to prevent the loss of the Tax Benefit of such HPQ Co Carryback and such
Adjustment Request, based on Unimins sole, reasonable determination, will
cause no Tax detriment to the Unimin Group or any member of the Unimin Group
(unless HPQ Co agrees to reimburse Unimin for the Tax detriment (including as
a result of any disallowance in whole or in part of the HPQ Co Carryback) at
no net cost to Unimin). Any Adjustment Request which Unimin consents to make
under this  _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ shall be prepared and filed by Unimin or the
applicable member of the Unimin Group, and HPQ Co shall be responsible for
any out-of-pocket expenses with respect to such request and filing.

 

4.4 _Basis of Transferred Assets and Apportionment of Other Tax Attributes._
As soon as reasonably practicable following the Distribution Date, Unimin
shall notify HPQ Co in writing of the adjusted Tax basis of the assets
transferred to HPQ Co in the Contribution and the portion, if any, of any
earnings and profits, overall foreign loss or other Tax Attribute from Pre-
Distribution Periods, including consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Attributes, which Unimin determines shall be allocated or apportioned to HPQ
Co under applicable Tax Law. Unimin shall provide reasonable timely updates
to HPQ Co of the adjusted Tax basis of assets and the allocation of Tax
Attributes as Unimin finalizes Tax Returns for the Unimin Group and as
adjustments, if any, are subsequently made to such Tax Returns. HPQ Co and all
members of the HPQ Co Group shall prepare all Tax Returns in accordance with
such written notice. As soon as practicable after receipt of a written request
from HPQ Co, Unimin shall provide copies of any studies, reports, and
workpapers supporting the adjusted Tax basis of the transferred assets and
other Tax Attributes allocable to HPQ Co. Any dispute regarding the adjusted
Tax basis and apportionment of any other Tax Attribute shall be resolved
pursuant to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 14_. All Tax Returns prepared
by the Unimin Group and the HPQ Co Group shall be consistent with the adjusted
Tax basis and any allocation or apportionment as determined pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.4_.

4.5 _Review and Comment Rights_. With respect to any Tax Return reflecting
Taxes for which both Unimin or any Affiliate of Unimin, on the one hand, and
HPQ Co or any Affiliate of HPQ Co, on the other, are responsible under
_Section_ __ _ 2_, the Filing Party shall provide the other party (the "Non-
Filing Party") with a draft of each such Tax Return for the Non-Filing Partys

 



17  review and comment, in the case of a Tax Return for Income Taxes, at least
30 days or, in the case of a Tax Return for Other Taxes, at least 15 days (or,
in the case of Tax Returns for Other Taxes, such shorter period as
circumstances may reasonably require) prior to the due date for filing the
applicable Tax Return (including extensions). The Non-Filing Party shall have,
in the case of a Tax Return for Income Taxes, ten days or, in the case of a
Tax Return for Other Taxes, five days (or, in the case of Tax Returns for
Other Taxes, such shorter period as circumstances may reasonably require) from
receipt of such draft Tax Return to submit in writing any objection to such
Tax Return, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for any such
objection, _provided_ that any such objections shall be limited only to items
that reasonably could be expected to result in an indemnity obligation or
right to a refund under this Agreement for the Non-Filing Party (a "Tax Return
Objection Notice"). If the Non-Filing Party does not timely submit a Tax
Return Objection Notice in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,
then the Non-Filing Party shall be deemed to have agreed to the applicable Tax
Return as prepared by the Filing Party. If the Non-Filing Party timely
submits a Tax Return Objection Notice, then the Parties shall work together in
good faith to resolve the objections raised in such notice; _provided_ that,
if the Parties are not able to resolve all objections raised in a Tax Return
Objection Notice prior to the due date for filing the applicable Tax Return
(including extensions), such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the
Filing Party, but reflecting all non-disputed comments provided by the Non-
Filing Party, and, at the Non-Filing Partys election, the remaining disputed
items shall be referred for resolution pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14_, in
which case, after the Tax Advisor finally resolves the dispute, such Tax
Return shall be amended as necessary to reflect the determination of the Tax
Advisor.

19 6\. Tax Benefits.

 

6.1 _General._ Except as set forth below, Unimin shall be entitled to any
refund or portion thereof (and any interest thereon received from the
applicable Tax Authority) of Income Taxes and Other Taxes for which Unimin is
liable hereunder, HPQ Co shall be entitled to any refund or portion thereof
(and any interest thereon received from the applicable Tax Authority) of
Income Taxes and Other Taxes for which HPQ Co is liable hereunder and a
Company receiving a refund (including by way of credit or offset) to which
another Company is entitled (in whole or in part) hereunder shall pay over
such refund or portion thereof (net of charges imposed on the Company
receiving the refund) to such other Company within 30 days after such refund
is received (together with interest computed at the Prime Rate based on the
number of days from the date the refund was received to the date the refund
was paid over).

6.2 _Reimbursements._ If a member of the HPQ Co Group actually realizes in
cash any Tax Benefit as a result of an adjustment pursuant to a Final
Determination to any Taxes for which a member of the Unimin Group is liable
hereunder (or to any Tax Attribute of a member of the Unimin Group) and such
Tax Benefit would not have arisen but for such adjustment (determined on a
"with and without" basis (treating any such Tax Benefit as the last item
claimed for the taxable year, including after the utilization of any available
net operating loss carryforwards)), or if a member of the Unimin Group
actually realizes in cash any Tax Benefit as a result of an adjustment
pursuant to a Final Determination to any Taxes for which a member of the HPQ
Co Group is liable hereunder (or to any Tax Attribute of a member of the HPQ
Co Group) and such Tax Benefit would not have arisen but for such adjustment
(determined on a "with and without" basis (treating any such Tax Benefit as
the last item claimed for the taxable year, including after the utilization of
any available net operating loss carryforwards)), HPQ Co or Unimin, as the
case may be, shall make a payment to either Unimin or HPQ Co, as appropriate,
within 30 days following such actual realization of the Tax Benefit, in an
amount equal to such Tax Benefit actually realized in cash (including any Tax
Benefit actually realized as a result of the payment) plus interest on such
amount computed at the Prime Rate based on the number of days from the date of
such actual realization of the Tax Benefit to the date of payment of such
amount under this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_. For the avoidance of doubt, a Tax
Benefit is actually realized when the amount of Tax payable is reduced below
the amount that would otherwise be payable without the Tax Benefit.

6.3 _Cooperation._ If as a result of (x) an assessment by a Tax Authority, (y)
an amended Return or (z) otherwise, there is an increase in Taxes for which
one Group is liable hereunder because of additional income, reduction in a Tax
Attribute or otherwise, then the other Group shall at the request of the first
Group file an amended Return or otherwise pursue any Tax Benefits claim
available to the other Group as a result of the Tax adjustment to the first
Group, _provided_ that the first Group has furnished the other Group with (i)
an opinion of a Tax Advisor reasonably satisfactory to the other Group to the
effect that it is at least more likely than not that the other Group will
prevail in obtaining Tax Benefits or otherwise reducing the Taxes of the other
Group because of the Tax adjustment to the first Group, and (ii) an
acknowledgement that the first Group will reimburse the other Group for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the other Group in
connection with making such Tax Benefit claim.

in sufficient time for the Responsible Company to file such Tax Returns on a
timely basis.

 

(b) _Rulings and Supplemental Tax Opinions_. If Sibelco, HPQ Co or Unimin
requests the assistance of any other Party in obtaining a Ruling or
Supplemental Tax Opinion, reasonable assistance (including delivery of
customary or reasonable representations through an officers certificate not

costs and expenses incurred by the other Party in connection with obtaining
such a Ruling or Supplemental Tax Opinion, with payment due within ten
Business Days after receiving an invoice therefor.

8.3 _Confidentiality_. Any information or documents provided under this
_Section_ __ _ 8_ shall be kept confidential by the Company receiving the

with the filing of Tax Returns or in connection with any administrative or

any other Person with any information and documentation requested under this
_Section_ __ _ 8_ if the provision of such information or documentation
would result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege or other applicable
privilege or protection or would violate any Law.

 



24 9\. Tax Records. Unimin shall preserve and keep all Tax Records exclusively
relating to the assets and activities of its Group for Pre-Distribution
Periods, and Unimin shall preserve and keep all other Tax Records relating to
Taxes of the Groups for Pre-Distribution Periods until the later of (i) the
expiration of any applicable statutes of limitations, or (ii) seven years
after the Distribution Date. After such later date occurs, Unimin may dispose
of such Tax Records upon 90 days prior written notice to HPQ Co. HPQ Co shall
have the opportunity, at its cost and expense, to copy or remove, within such
90-day period, all or part of such Tax Records.

10\. Tax Contests.

 

10.1 _Notice._ Within ten days after a Company becomes aware of the
commencement of a Tax Contest that may give rise to Taxes for which the
another Company is responsible pursuant to this Agreement, such Company shall
notify the other Company or Companies of such Tax Contest. Such notice shall
provide that the notifying Company may seek indemnification from the other
Company or Companies under this Agreement and shall attach copies of the
pertinent portion of any written communication from a Tax Authority and
contain factual information (to the extent known) describing any asserted Tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by copies of any
notice and other documents received from any Tax Authority in respect of any
such matters. A failure of a Company to comply with this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_
shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnification obligation
under this Agreement, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
the ability of the indemnifying party to contest the liability for the
relevant Tax or increases the amount of such liability.

 

10.2 _Control of Tax Contests_.

 

(a) _Separate Company Taxes._ In the case of any Tax Contest with respect to
any Separate Return for Income Taxes, the Filing Party shall have exclusive

, _(g)_ , _(h)_ and _(i)_.

_(i)_.

_(i)_.

 

(d) _Other Taxes._ In the case of any Tax Contest with respect to any Other
Taxes (i) Unimin shall control the defense or prosecution of the portion of
the Tax Contest directly and exclusively related to any Unimin Adjustment,
including settlement of any such Unimin Adjustment and (ii) HPQ Co shall
control the defense or prosecution of the portion of the Tax 

 



25  Contest directly and exclusively related to any HPQ Co Adjustment, including
settlement of any such HPQ Co Adjustment, and (iii) Unimin and HPQ Co shall
jointly control the defense or prosecution of adjustments for which Unimin,
HPQ Co or any of their Affiliates could each be liable and any and all
administrative matters not directly and exclusively related to any Unimin
Adjustment or HPQ Co Adjustment.

 

(e) _Tax-Related Losses_. Either Sibelco, HPQ Co or Unimin shall have
exclusive control over the Tax Contest involving any Tax Adjustment proposed,
asserted or assessed pursuant to any Tax Contest relating to or involving any
Tax-Related Losses to the extent such Party is allocated such Tax under 
_Section_ __ _ 7.4_, including exclusive authority with respect to any
settlement of such Tax liability, subject to _Sections 10.2(f)_ , _(g)_ ,
_(h)_ and _(i)_.

 

(f) _Settlement Rights._ For Tax Contests other than those that are jointly
controlled by the Parties pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.2(d)_, unless
waived by the Non-Controlling Party in writing, in connection with any
potential adjustment in a Tax Contest as a result of which adjustment the Non-
Controlling Party may reasonably be expected to become liable to make any
indemnification payment (or any payment under _Section_ __ _ 6_) to the
Controlling Party under this Agreement: (i) the Controlling Party shall keep
the Non-Controlling Party informed in a timely manner of all actions taken or
proposed to be taken by the Controlling Party with respect to such potential
adjustment in such Tax Contest; (ii) the Controlling Party shall provide the
Non-Controlling Party copies of any written materials relating to such
potential adjustment in such Tax Contest received from any Tax Authority;
(iii) the Controlling Party shall timely provide the Non-Controlling Party
with copies of any correspondence or filings submitted to any Tax Authority or
judicial authority in connection with such potential adjustment in such Tax
Contest; (iv) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling
Party and offer the Non-Controlling Party a reasonable opportunity to comment
before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection
with such potential adjustment in such Tax Contest; (v) the Controlling Party
shall defend such Tax Contest diligently and in good faith; and (vi) the
Controlling Party shall not settle or compromise such Tax Contest without the
prior written consent of the Non-Controlling Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The failure of the Controlling Party to
take any action specified in the preceding sentence with respect to the Non-
Controlling Party shall not relieve the Non-Controlling Party of any
liability and/or obligation which it may have to the Controlling Party under
this Agreement except to the extent that the Non-Controlling Party was
materially prejudiced by such failure. In the case of any Tax Contest
described in _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_ , or _(d)_ , "Controlling
Party" means the Company entitled to control the Tax Contest under such
Section and "Non-Controlling Party" means the other Company or Companies.

connection with any potential adjustment in a Tax Contest pursuant to which
the Non-Controlling Party may reasonably be expected to become liable to make
any indemnification payment (or any payment under _Section_ __ _ 6_) to the
Controlling Party under this Agreement. The failure of the Controlling Party
to provide any notice specified in this _Section_ __ _ 10.2(g)_ to the Non-
Controlling Party shall not relieve the Non-Controlling Party of any liability
and/or obligation which it may have to the Controlling Party under this
Agreement except to the extent that the Non-Controlling Party was materially
prejudiced by such failure.

 



26 (h) _Power of Attorney._ HPQ Co shall execute and deliver (or cause any member
of the HPQ Co Group to deliver), Unimin shall execute and deliver (or cause
any member of the Unimin Group to deliver), and Sibelco shall execute and

other in the conduct of Tax Contests as reasonably requested by either of

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any documentation from a
governmental authority or a third party that may be necessary or helpful in

facilities reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to facilitate
such cooperation.

11\. Effective Date _._ This Agreement shall be effective as of the
Distribution Date.

12\. Survival. This Agreement shall remain in force and be binding so long as
the applicable period for assessments or collections of Tax or the right to
claim or use any Tax Benefit (including extensions) remains unexpired for any
Taxes or Tax Benefits contemplated by, or indemnified against in, this
Agreement plus two years; _provided_ that to the extent a claim for
indemnification is made prior to the expiration of this Agreement, this
Agreement shall survive until such claim is finally resolved.

 

13\. Treatment of Payments.

 

13.1 _General._ In the absence of any change in Tax treatment under the Code
or other applicable Tax Law, any indemnity payment between HPQ Co and Unimin
made under this Agreement, including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2_, _4.3_ ,
_5_ or _7.4_ , and any Tax Benefit payment made under this Agreement,
including pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6_, shall be treated, for all Tax
purposes, as made immediately before the Distribution as a distribution (or,
as context requires, an assumption of a liability under the Business
Contribution Agreement or otherwise) by HPQ Co to (or from) Unimin or as a
contribution by Unimin to HPQ Co, as appropriate. To the extent one Company
makes a payment of interest to another Company relating to a payment of Tax
under this Agreement, the interest payment shall be treated as interest
expense to the payor and as interest income by the recipient and the amount of
such payment shall not be adjusted to take into account any associated Tax
Benefit to the payor or increase in Tax to the recipient.

 

13.2 _After-Tax Basis. _All indemnity payments under this Agreement, including
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2_, _4.3_ , _5_ or _7.4_ , shall be (i)
increased to take account of any net Tax cost actually incurred by the
indemnified party arising from the receipt or accrual of indemnity payments
(grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of any net
Tax Benefit actually realized by the indemnified party arising from the
incurrence or payment of any amount or other loss indemnified against. In
computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax Benefit,

 



27  the indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of
income, gain, loss deduction or credit, including the utilization of any
available net operating loss carryforwards, before recognizing any item
arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence
or payment of any amount or other loss indemnified against hereunder. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 13.2_, an indemnified party shall be deemed
to have "actually incurred" or "actually realized" a net Tax cost or a net Tax
Benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes payable
(including Taxes payable on an estimated basis) by such indemnified party is
increased above or reduced below, as the case may be, the amount of Taxes that
such indemnified party would be required to pay but for the receipt or accrual
of the indemnity payment or the incurrence or payment of such amount
indemnified against as the case may be. The Companies shall make any adjusting
payment between each other as is required under this _Section_ __ _ 13.2_
within ten (10) days of the date an indemnified party is deemed to have
actually realized or actually incurred each net Tax Benefit or net Tax cost.
The amount of any increase or reduction hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect
any Final Determination with respect to the indemnified partys liability for
Taxes and any payments necessary to reflect such adjustment shall be made
within ten (10) days of such determination.

14. Disagreements.

14.1 _General Procedures._ The Companies will use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve in an amicable manner all disagreements and
misunderstandings connected with their respective rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including those, if any, relating to the interpretation,
implementation or compliance with the provisions of this Agreement).
In furtherance thereof, in the event of any dispute or disagreement with
respect to this Agreement (a "Tax Matters Dispute") between Sibelco, any
member of the Unimin Group and any member of the HPQ Co Group, the Tax
departments of the Companies (and their advisers if requested) shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve the Tax Matters Dispute. In the event that
such good faith negotiations do not resolve the Tax Matters Dispute, any one
of the Parties that is party to the dispute may by delivering a request in
writing to the other(s), subject the Tax Matters Dispute to the procedures set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 14.2_.

 

14.2 _Tax Advisor Resolution._ In the case of any Tax Matters Dispute governed
by this _Section_ __ _ 14.2_, the disputing Parties shall appoint a Tax
Advisor to resolve such dispute. In this regard, the Tax Advisor shall make
determinations with respect to the disputed items based solely on
representations and factual submissions made by the Parties to the Tax
Matters Dispute and their respective representatives, and shall not conduct an
independent review, and shall function only as an expert and not as an
arbitrator and shall be required to make a determination in favor of one Party
only. The Parties shall require the Tax Advisor to resolve any Tax Matters
Dispute submitted no later than thirty Business Days after submission of such
dispute to the Tax Advisor, but (unless otherwise mutually agreed by the
Parties) in no event later than the due date for the payment of Taxes or the
filing of the applicable Tax Return, if applicable, and agree that all
decisions by the Tax Advisor with respect thereto shall be final and
conclusive and binding on the Parties. The Tax Advisor shall resolve any and
all Tax Matters Disputes in a manner consistent with this Agreement and, to
the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, in a manner consistent with
Past Practices, except as otherwise required by applicable Tax Law. The
Parties shall require the Tax Advisor to render all determinations in writing
and to set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such determination. The
fees and expenses of the Tax Advisor shall be borne equally by the prevailing
Party or Parties, on the one hand, and the non-prevailing Party or Parties,
on the other.

 



28 15\. Late Payments. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any amount
owed by one Company to another Company under this Agreement that is not paid
when due shall bear interest from the due date until paid at the Prime Rate
plus two percent, compounded semiannually.

 

16\. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Company
and its Affiliates shall bear their own expenses incurred in connection with
preparation of Tax Returns, Tax Contests, and other matters related to Taxes
under the provisions of this Agreement.

 

17\. Sibelco Guaranty. Sibelco hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees to Unimin and its Affiliates the due and punctual payment in full
of all the payment obligations of HPQ Co and its Affiliates under this
Agreement (including under Sections 2, 5, 6, and 7.4(b)) (the "HPQ Co Tax
Obligations"). If, for any reason whatsoever, HPQ Co and its Affiliates fail
to or are unable to duly, punctually, and fully pay the HPQ Co Tax
Obligations, Sibelco will forthwith pay (or cause to be paid) the HPQ Co Tax
Obligations. Sibelco agrees that the Sibelco Guaranty is irrevocable,
absolute, independent, and unconditional and the Sibelco Guaranty will not be
affected by any circumstances that constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of a guarantor or surety, other than the payment in full of the HPQ Co Tax
Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sibelco agrees
that the Sibelco Guaranty is (i) a guaranty of payment when due and not of
collectability or performance, and (ii) independent of the obligations of HPQ
Co and its Affiliates under this Agreement and a separate action may be
brought against and prosecuted against Sibelco if, but only if, HPQ Co and its
Affiliates fail to or are unable to duly, punctually, and fully pay the HPQ Co
Tax Obligations, whether or not any action is or may be brought against HPQ
Co and its Affiliates.

18.2 _Amendment and Waivers._ This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except by an instrument in writing, consented to in writing by each of the
Parties. Each Party may (a) extend the time for performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in
this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants or
conditions for the benefit of such Party contained in this Agreement,
_provided_ that (i) any such extension or waiver by a Party will be valid only
if set forth in a written document signed on behalf of the Party against whom
such extension or waiver is to be effective; (ii) no extension or waiver will
apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty or noncompliance with any covenant or condition, as the case may be,
other than that which is specified in the written extension or waiver and
(iii) no failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right or remedy under
this Agreement or any of the documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
and no course of dealing between the Parties, operates as a waiver of such
right or remedy, and no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy
precludes any other or further exercise of such right or remedy or the
exercise of any other right or remedy.

18.3 _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to either Company. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Companies shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Companies as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible. 

18.4 _No Duplication of Payment._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, nothing in this Agreement shall require a Company to make
any payment attributable to any indemnification for Taxes or payment of Taxes
hereunder, or to any Tax Benefit, for which payment has previously been
compensated by such Company or another Company hereunder.

 



31 18.5 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including
by facsimile or portable document format (PDF) transmission) in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same instrument.

 

18.6 _Governing Law._ Each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the purposes of any suit, action or
other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby or thereby. Each Party agrees to commence any such action, suit or
proceeding either in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York located in the borough of Manhattan or, if such
Proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. Each Party further
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to such Partys respective address set forth in _Section_ __ _
18.1_, shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding in New York with respect to any matters to which it has submitted
to jurisdiction in this _Section_ __ _ 18.6_. Each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby in the New York Courts, and hereby and thereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such Proceeding brought in any New York Court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

18.7 _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part,
by operation of law or otherwise by any Party without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Any purported assignment without such consent shall
be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding

respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party
may assign this Agreement without consent in connection with (a) a merger
transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving
entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Partys assets,
or (b) the sale of all or substantially all of such Partys assets; _provided_
, _however_ , that such assignment shall be effective only if, and as of the
time when, the assignee expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations
of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party provides
written notice and evidence of such assignment and assumption to the non-
assigning Party. No assignment permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 18.7_ shall
release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its
obligations under this Agreement

36 EXHIBIT F

 

 _DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT_

THIS DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), is dated as of [●], (the
"Effective Date"), by and between Unimin Corporation, a Delaware corporation
[("Producer")][("Distributor")] and SCR-Sibelco NV, a Belgian public company
[("Producer")][("Distributor")].

WHEREAS, Producer seeks to have Distributor serve as a distributor of certain
of its Products as hereinafter defined under the terms and conditions set
forth herein; and

WHEREAS, Distributor seeks to distribute the Products in accordance with the
terms set forth herein and further seeks a license to use certain trademarks
owned by Producer in conjunction with its sale of Producers Products;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties, intending to be bound, agree as follows:

 

1\. _Appointment of Distributor_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Producer hereby appoints
Distributor as an authorized distributor for the Producer materials listed on
the attached Exhibit A ("Products") on an exclusive basis for the Industries
listed on attached Exhibit B (each, an "Industry") within the geographical
area listed on attached Exhibit C (the "Trading Area"), and Distributor
hereby accepts such appointment. The provisions of this Agreement constitute
the entire agreement and understanding between the parties on the subject
matter of this Agreement, and except as specifically set forth herein, there
are no additional agreements, understandings, representations, covenants,
warranties or guaranties, written or oral, between the parties, relating to
the subject matter of the Agreement. Prior arrangements, agreements and
understandings, if any, are superseded by this Agreement. Distributor may
appoint any third party to act as a sub-distributor, upon obtaining Producers
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(b) The relationship of the parties created pursuant to this Agreement is, and
is intended to be, that of independent contractors. Distributor will not by
any action represent itself as having the authority to assume or create any
obligation or liability on behalf of Producer. Distributor understands and
acknowledges that its relationship with Producer is that of a buyer to a
seller and that Distributor is not an agent, partner or franchisee of
Producer. Distributor will purchase Products and resell them in Distributors
own name, for Distributors own account, and at Distributors own risk. Under
no circumstances will this Agreement be construed as appointing Distributor as
a commercial or other agent of Producer pursuant to the laws of any country. 2\. _Distributor Responsibilities_. The Distributor shall:

 

(a) Diligently sample, sell, advertise and promote the sale of the Products to
the Industry in the Trading Area to fulfill the Products sales objectives
mutually established by the parties from time to time;

(b) Maintain a bona fide sales department adequately staffed, trained and
equipped to enable Distributor to serve the Industry in the Trading Area
adequately and properly, to give customers technical sales assistance, address
and resolve customer complaints and to fulfill its other obligations under
this Agreement; 

(c) Maintain adequate sales and warehouse facilities as well as a
representative and adequate stock of the Products to meet the demands of the
Industry in the Trading Area;

(d) Prepare and maintain, and submit to the Producer on a timely basis, all
documentation and reports reasonably required from time to time to be
prepared, maintained or submitted, including but not limited to, the
following: customer, sales, freight and inventory data regarding the Products,
pricing and volume data, and call reports regarding visits to existing and
potential customers in the Trading Area, all in such form and at such times as
Producer may from time to time reasonably request;

 

(e) Maintain adequate supply of all current literature (including product data
sheets, safety data sheets ("SDS"), brochures, etc.) relating to the Products
and to provide customers and prospective customers with copies of the same at
the time of Product inquiry or sale and, in particular, maintain and provide
all customers of Products with appropriate safety related literature and SDS
in full compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements including, as
applicable, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard;

 

(f) Participate in trade shows and exhibitions in the Trading Area where, in
Distributors reasonable business judgment, such participation will promote
the Products;

(g) Not make any representation or warranty with respect to any Products,
other than as expressly provided by Producer;

(h) Conduct its business in a professional and ethical manner, and in
compliance with all applicable laws including, without limitation, those
pertaining to taxes and the prohibition of corruption, bribery and the
offering of inducements to public or semi-public officials, including the
United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

 

(i) In the event Distributor purchases any Products in bulk and then bags such
material prior to sale to customers, Distributor shall (i) use bagging and
packaging materials which will fully comply with any and all applicable laws
and regulations including, as applicable, the OSHA Hazard Communication
Standard; and (ii) only sell and distribute Products in bags or containers
bearing a health warning which has either been: (A) approved in writing by
Producer or (B) provided by Producer;

 



2 (j) Sell, advertise and promote the Products only to customers in the Industry
within the Trading Area and promptly refer all orders for Products from
outside the Trading Area, and any orders for Products from inside the Trading
Area for use outside the Industry, in each case where Distributor is not
authorized to sell such Products, to Producer or its nominee.

3\. _Producer s Responsibilities_.

 

(a) Provided Distributor is not in breach of any of its obligations under this
Agreement, Producer shall (i) sell the Products to the Distributor as
provided in this Agreement, and (ii) supply Distributor without charge with
reasonable quantities of its regular promotional materials relating to the
Products, including safety and technical data sheets, bulletins and such
other data as Producer may from time to time have for promotional purposes.

(b) Producer shall conduct its business in a professional and ethical manner,
and in compliance with all applicable laws including, without limitation,
those pertaining to taxes and the prohibition of corruption, bribery and the
offering of inducements to public or semi-public officials, including the
United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

4\. _Pricing_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, the initial
price of each Product to be sold to Distributor under this Agreement for re-
sale by Distributor shall be set at a price equal to 90% of the average sale
price of such Product on the customer market over the 12 months prior to the
Effective Date.

 

(b) Except as otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, at the start of
each Contract Year, the price of each Product to be sold to Distributor under
this Agreement for re-sale by Distributor shall be adjusted by the percentage
increase or decrease in the average sales price of such Product sold by
Distributor on the customer market (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any transportation costs) ("AMSP") between the previous two contract years in
accordance with the following formula:

 

Product price for Contract Year [x]

      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    = |  | _ _AMSP in Contract Year__ _[ _x_  1] ___ __ |  | X
Product price in Contract Year [x  1] 
    | _AMSP in Contract Year_ [ _x_  2] __ | 
 

provided that, if the foregoing adjustment would result in a price increase or
decrease of greater than 10% as a result of extraordinary market
circumstances (for example, a temporary shortage of supply due to unforeseen
circumstances), the parties shall negotiate in good faith an appropriate price
adjustment that excludes, to the extent possible, the impact of
such extraordinary market circumstance. If the parties are unable to agree on
an appropriate price adjustment within 30 days, the price shall be adjusted in
accordance with the foregoing formula. For purposes of the foregoing, each
successive 12-month period during the Term (the first of which will commence
on the Effective Date) is referred to as a "Contract Year".

 



3 (c) Except as set forth in Exhibit B or C with respect to any particular
Industry or Trading Area, all prices are net F.O.B. Producers plant or
warehouse, as applicable (each, the "Producer Location"), and are exclusive of
any sales, use, property, excise, occupation, import or export tax or other
similar tax levied or that may be levied by any federal, state, governmental
or other taxing authorities in connection with the sales of the Products, and
any applicable transportation or other surcharges, all of which shall be paid
by Distributor. Distributor shall bear the risk of loss or damage in transit
after Products have been delivered to a transportation company for shipment to
Distributor or any third party pursuant to Distributors instructions. Special
packaging, if required, shall be priced extra. Delivery dates and shipment
dates are estimates only and are not guaranteed.

(d) Distributor shall pay Producer for Products in US dollars in the full
amount invoiced by Producer, without deduction or set-off of any kind. Payment
shall be made net sixty (60) days after the date of shipment. Failure to pay
an invoice by the due date, at Producers election, makes all subsequent
invoices immediately due and payable, irrespective of terms. In the event of
Distributors (i) insolvency, (ii) failure to pay an invoice by the due date
or (iii) material breach of any of the terms of this Agreement, Producer
shall have the right to stop delivery of the Products (including withholding
deliveries under outstanding orders) until full payment is received or the
breach is otherwise remedied.

 

5\. _Warranty_.

(a) Producer warrants solely to Distributor only that (i) Products furnished
hereunder shall conform to applicable specifications and (ii) Distributor
shall acquire good and marketable title to the Products, and no other warranty
shall be implied. Provided that Distributor gives notice in accordance with
Section 5(b) below, if Products sold hereunder fail to conform to applicable
specifications, demonstrated to Producers reasonable satisfaction to have
existed at the time of departure from Producers plant, Producer, reserving
the right to inspect Products, shall, at Producers option, replace at
Producers expense F.O.B. Distributors plant or give Distributor credit for
Products determined to be non-conforming. Producer shall not be obligated to
replace or provide credit for Products that shall have been subjected to
alteration, contamination, improper maintenance or storage, misapplication,
misuse, negligence or accident during or after shipment from Producers
plant. The remedy set forth in this Section 5(a) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to Distributor for breach of warranty. In no event
shall Distributors remedy exceed the purchase price of the non-conforming
Products, plus any transportation costs paid by Producer to supply replacement
materials to Distributor as described above in this Section 5(a) and Producer
shall not be liable for any other loss or damage, whether direct or indirect.
THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 5 ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES APPLICABLE
TO THE PRODUCTS SOLD HEREUNDER. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED AND SHALL NOT APPLY.
Distributor is solely responsible for determining suitability for use and
Producer shall in no event be liable in this respect. The giving or failure
to give advice, recommendation or safety warnings of any character by Producer
shall not impose any liability upon Producer.

 



4 (b) It shall be the duty of Distributor to thoroughly inspect the Products
purchased from Producer. Except for claims based on latent defects (which the
parties recognize may not be discoverable through an inspection), all claims
of any nature relating to the Products for any defect, non-conformity or
discrepancy in quantity or delivery date, shall be made in writing to
Producers customer service department within 30 days of receipt of such
Products by Distributor. Failure to make any such written claim within the
above-prescribed period shall constitute waiver of any such claims and shall
be deemed acceptance of such materials, quantities or delivery dates.

(c) Neither party shall be liable to the other party for any special,
incidental, consequential, indirect or punitive damages (including loss of
(anticipated) profits) arising in any way out of this Agreement, however
caused and on any theory of liability,  _except_ with respect to claims based
on intentional fraud or intentional misconduct. For the avoidance of doubt, if
any of the foregoing damages are awarded to a third party and a party has a
right to bring a claim against the other party under this Agreement in
respect of such third party claim, such damages will be considered direct
damages.

6\. _Safety Warning and Handling_.

(a) WARNING: RESIN COATED PROPPANTS  POSSIBLE DUST EXPLOSION HAZARD AND MAY
CAUSE ALLERGIC SKIN REACTION. WARNING: FRACTURING SAND AND RESIN COATED
PROPPANTS  MAY CAUSE DELAYED LUNG INJURY AND CANCER HAZARD. BOTH MATERIALS
CONTAIN FREE CRYSTALLINE SILICA. DO NOT BREATHE DUST. PROLONGED INHALATION OF
THE ABOVE AND OF AIRBORNE SILICA CONTAINED IN SILICA SAND, CRISTOBALITE AND
MATERIALS CONTAINING SILICA CAN CAUSE DELAYED LUNG INJURY AND/OR RESPIRATORY
DISEASE, INCLUDING SILICOSIS, A PROGRESSIVE DISABLING AND SOMETIMES FATAL LUNG
DISEASE. THE INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR RESEARCH ON CANCER HAS DETERMINED THAT
SILICA DUST (WHICH INCLUDES CRYSTALLINE AND MICROCRYSTALLINE SILICA),
CRISTOBALITE DUST AND CRYSTALLINE SILICA INHALED FROM OCCUPATIONAL SOURCES CAN
CAUSE CANCER IN HUMANS. AVOID CREATING DUST WHEN HANDLING, USING OR STORING.
FOLLOW OSHA OR OTHER RELEVANT SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS AND USE GOOD
HOUSEKEEPING AND ADEQUATE VENTILATION TO KEEP EXPOSURE BELOW RECOMMENDED
EXPOSURE LIMITS. AVOID PROLONGED OR REPEATED SKIN CONTACT. THE RISK OF LUNG
DISEASE IS INCREASED IF SMOKING IS COMBINED WITH SILICA RESPIRATION. CURRENT
SAFETY DATA SHEET IS AVAILABLE AND SHOULD BE CONSULTED BEFORE HANDLING THIS
MATERIAL. PROPER RESPIRATORY PROTECTION, SILICA DUST PREVENTION AND APPLICABLE
HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATORY PROTOCOLS MUST BE STRICTLY OBSERVED AT ALL TIMES
WHEN HANDLING MATERIALS SUPPLIED BY PRODUCER TO MINIMIZE RISK OF INJURY DUE TO
INHALATION OF AIRBORNE SILICA. RESIN COATED PROPPANTS: UNLOADING OPERATIONS 
DO NOT EXCEED 5 PSI WHEN UNLOADING THIS MATERIAL TO MINIMIZE THE CREATION OF
AIRBORNE DUST AND POSSIBLE DUST EXPLOSION HAZARD.

 



5 (b) PRODUCER WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO DISTRIBUTOR FOR ANY HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS
WHICH MAY BE CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO MATERIALS SUPPLIED BY PRODUCER HEREUNDER.
Distributor warrants that it will adequately warn all of its employees and
customers who may come in contact with materials supplied by Producer of the
above described health hazards. Further, Distributor warrants it will fully
comply with all applicable health and safety regulations and orders relating
to the workplace handling of Products supplied by Producer. Distributor agrees
that if the Products supplied hereunder are resold by Distributor,
Distributor will include in its contract for resale provisions which include
the full substance of those contained in this Section 6, including the
foregoing safety warning.

 

7\. _Producer Label, Products and Information_. Distributor agrees that it
will not remove from any Product purchased hereunder, or obliterate, any
label, decal, trademark, product warning or instruction, patent or
manufacturers lot numbers placed thereon by Producer.

 

8\. _Trademarks_.

 

(a) The Distributor shall not use or register any trademark used by or
registered in the name of Producer, or any affiliate of Producer ("Producer
Trademarks"), or any word or trademark that is similar in sight, sound or
meaning, or otherwise likely to be confused therewith, in any manner except as
permitted by Producer in connection with the promotion, advertising, and sale
of each of the Products. Distributor shall observe all applicable quality
standards specified by Producer as to the manner of use of the Producer
Trademarks applicable to each of the Products being distributed by Distributor
in the packaging, labeling, promoting, advertising and/or selling of such
Products by Distributor. On Producers request, all packaging, labels,
promotional and advertising materials created by Distributor and containing
any Producer Trademark, as well as the promotion of any of the Products with
the applicable Producer Trademark by Distributor at any trade show, shall be
subject to review and approval by Producer. Upon termination of this
Agreement, Distributor shall cease immediately all use of the Producer
Trademarks, and shall remove them or cause them to be removed from all signs,
advertisements, letterheads, bill heads, forms, listings and any other things
on which they may be used by the Distributor, and shall discontinue
all representations from which it might be inferred that Distributor is an
authorized distributor of any of the Products of Producer. The Distributor
acknowledges Producers exclusive ownership of Producer Trademarks and
acquires no right, title or interest in or to the Producer Trademarks
hereunder.

(b) Producer hereby grants to the Distributor for the Term, and subject to the
terms and conditions herein, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
right to use the Producer Trademarks in connection with the marketing and
promotion of the Products in the Trading Area in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and any guidelines issued by Producer from
time to time. During the Term, Distributor shall have the right to indicate to
the public that it is an authorized Distributor of the Products.

9\. _Product Changes_. Producer reserves the right from time to time, in its
absolute discretion, without incurring any liability to the Distributor with
respect to any purchase order previously placed or inventory held by
Distributor, or otherwise, to discontinue or to limit its

 



6  production or alter the specifications of any Product or Product line, to
terminate or limit deliveries of any Product or Product line, the production
of which is so discontinued, limited or altered, and to add new and
additional products or product lines; provided, that, any new products or
product lines shall first be offered to Distributor for exclusive resale in
the Industry in the Trading Area pursuant to the terms and conditions set
forth herein.

10\. _Term; Termination_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall, unless
earlier terminated pursuant to subsections (b) through (f) hereof, continue
for a term of twenty (20) years following the Effective Date ("Term").

(b) Producer may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice to
Distributor, if Distributors annual sales volumes of Products by Industry or
Trading Area fall below the Applicable Minimum for two consecutive calendar
years during the Term; provided however that if Producer has supplied Product
volumes _less than_ 2016 levels in such year(s), Producer may only terminate
if Distributor failed to sell at least 80% of the Product supply made
available by Producer to Distributor in such year(s). For purposes of this
Agreement, "Applicable Minimum" means the amount set forth on Exhibit B with
respect to each Industry or on Exhibit C with respect to each Trading Area, as
the context requires.

 

(c) Producer may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice to
Distributor, if Distributor: (i) fails to make any payment called for under
this Agreement by the date falling ten (10) days after the due date, and such
failure has continued for twenty (20) or more days after Distributor receives
written notice from Producer specifying the failure to pay by such date; (ii)
breaches any of its obligations or restrictions in Section 2(h), 2(j), 7 or 8;
or (iii) for any reason, suffers the loss of any license or permit required by
law that is necessary for Distributor to carry out any of its obligations
under this Agreement, and such loss has continued for thirty (30) or more
days.

(d) Either party may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice
to the other party (i) if such other party fails to observe or perform any of
its obligations in this Agreement (other than those obligations addressed in
Section 10(b) or 10(c)), and such failure has continued for thirty (30) or
more days after such party receives written notice from the other party
specifying the nature of the alleged breach; (ii) if such other party
voluntarily commences any proceeding or files a petition seeking liquidation,
reorganization or other relief under any bankruptcy, receivership or similar
law; or (iii) if an involuntary proceeding is commenced or petition is filed
against such other party seeking liquidation, reorganization or other
relief in respect of such party under any bankruptcy, receivership or similar
law, and such proceeding or petition is not dismissed within sixty (60) days
after first initiated.

 

(e) This Agreement, and all obligations, terms and conditions contained
herein, shall automatically terminate without any further action required by
any party upon [Producer][Distributor], directly or indirectly, ceasing to own
more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of
[Producer][Distributor].1

 





   1  | Note to draft: Select appropriate parties for execution version. 
---|--- 
 



7 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a
termination is based on Section 10(b), 10(c) or 10(d) and the circumstance
giving rise to such termination is attributable to only a particular Industry
or jurisdiction of the Trading Area, then the termination may only apply to
such particular Industry or jurisdiction. If this Agreement is only
terminated in part, it will continue in full force and effect with respect to
the remaining Industry(ies) and jurisdictions of the Trading Area.

 

11\. _Rights on Termination_. Termination of this Agreement shall not affect
any right of Producer or Distributor that shall have arisen prior to such
termination, except that:

(a) Producer thereafter has the right, but shall be under no obligation, to
deliver to Distributor any Product for which it may have accepted an order
from Distributor, whether such order was scheduled for delivery prior to the
date of such termination or subsequent thereto, but Distributor agrees to
immediately pay the agreed price for said Products if delivered.

(b) In the event that Producer shall determine not to deliver to Distributor,
Distributor may, or at Producers option shall, assign any unfilled
customers orders on hand at time of termination for the Products to Producer
and Producer will ship and bill the customer directly, provided that
customers credit is satisfactory to Producer. On such orders Producer will
pay Distributor a selling commission of 5% of Distributors quoted price to
the customer for such Products . No further orders beyond those on hand at
termination would be handled in this manner.

 

(c) Producer has the right, but shall be under no obligation, to take back or
transfer to another distributor any of the Products which Distributor has not
sold within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of termination and
wishes to return to Producer. If such returned Products are unused, undamaged
and in a salable condition, as reasonably determined by Producer, Producer
will repay to Distributor an amount equal to Distributors reasonably
substantiated Laid In Cost therefore. Appropriate adjustments will be made in
the case of used or damaged goods. For purposes of this Agreement, "Laid-In
Cost" means the sum of (i) the price paid by Distributor to Producer for such
inventory, plus (ii) any sales, use, property, excise, occupation, import or
export tax or other non-refundable or non-creditable taxes paid by Distributor
(excluding income tax) for such inventory, plus (iii) the cost of freight,
insurance, warehouse handling, and any other direct expenses paid by
Distributor related to the movement of such inventory from the Producer
Location to Distributors warehouse or distribution center.

 

(d) All promotional literature, data sheets, sales aids, and other similar
materials or effects which the Producer may have furnished to the Distributor
in connection with its activities hereunder, will be returned immediately upon
notice of termination. Such material

 



8  will be shipped to Producer to any location selected by Producer within the
Trading Area. Distributor shall cease immediately upon termination of this
Agreement any activity which could reasonably be understood as Distributor
representing that it is a Producer distributor.

12\. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to Sections 5 and 13, Distributor will indemnify, defend and hold
Producer harmless from and against any and all claims and demands in each
case made by third parties and all resulting liabilities, obligations, costs,
losses and expenses, including court or arbitration costs and reasonable
attorneys and experts fees, that Producer may suffer to the extent
resulting from or arising out of: (i) any breach by Distributor (or any sub-
distributor) of any of its obligations or any of its representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement; (ii) any unauthorized act of
Distributor, its sub-distributors, or any of their agents or employees; (iii)
the negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct of Distributor or
its sub-distributors; or (iv) the relationship between Distributor and any of
its sub-distributors (even if approved in accordance with Section 1(a)), or
the termination thereof. At Producers election, in its sole discretion,
Distributor will take reasonable steps to defend Producer with respect to any
claim by a third party that is subject to the foregoing indemnity obligation
in any action, suit or other proceeding and select counsel that is reasonably
satisfactory to Producer, and Producer may participate in (at Producers
expense) all aspects of, any such proceeding, including any settlement thereof
(subject to Section 12(b)). Where Producer elects to defend the claim,
Distributor may participate (at its expense) in all aspects of any proceeding,
including any settlement of the claim (subject to Section 12(b)).

 

(b) The indemnified party will provide prompt written notice of a claim to the
indemnifying party; provided that the failure of any indemnified party to
give notice will not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under
this Section 12, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by such failure to give notice. The indemnifying party agrees to
timely reimburse the indemnified party for expenses incurred in connection
with a claim for which the indemnified party is entitled to indemnification
under this Section 12\. The party that has assumed the defense of any claim
pursuant to Section 12(a) may not settle the claim without the written
consent of the other party unless (i) the terms of such settlement do not
impose any obligations or restrictions on the indemnified party, (ii) the full
amount of any monetary settlement is paid by the indemnifying party, and
(iii) the indemnified party receives as part of such settlement a legal,
binding and enforceable unconditional release providing that such third party
claim and any claimed liability of the indemnified party with respect to the
third party claim is fully satisfied by reason of such settlement and that the
indemnified party is being released from any and all obligations and
liabilities it may have with respect to the third party claim.

13\. _Limitations on Liability_. Neither Producer nor the Distributor shall,
by reason of the termination or non-renewal of the Distributors
distributorship of the Products, be liable to the other for any
indemnification, compensation, reimbursement or damages on account of the loss
of prospective profits on anticipated sales, or on account of expenditures,
investments, leases or commitments in connection with the business or goodwill
of Producer or the Distributor, or otherwise. Irrespective of whether such
obligations or liabilities may be 

 



9  contemplated in the laws of the Trading Area or elsewhere, both parties
hereby waive any rights (if any) each may have to such indemnification,
compensation, reimbursement and damages in the event of the termination or
non-renewal of the Distributors distributorship of the Products.

 

14\. _Notice_. Except for purchase orders and invoices, which may be sent by
e-mail or such other written means as the parties may agree from time to
time, all notices to be given hereunder shall be deemed sufficient if in
writing and sent to the addresses set forth below, or to such other addresses
as may be subsequently designated by the parties in the manner provided
herein, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, or by nationally recognized overnight courier service: 3

15\. _Excusable Non-Performance_. A party shall not be liable for failure to
perform any part of this Agreement, except for the payment of money (which
obligation is not affected by this Section 15), to the extent and duration
that such failure to perform is on account of Acts of God or any government,
fire, strike, labor dispute, accident, war, insurrection, embargoes, delays of
carriers or suppliers, or for any other causes beyond such partys reasonable
control or without its fault ("Force Majeure"). In the case of any delay or
failure that either party anticipates will cause an excusable delay hereunder,
such party will, within ten (10) days of becoming aware of such delay or
failure, give the other party written notice thereof, including a

(a) This Agreement, including the attached Exhibits, which are incorporated
herein, contains the entire agreement and understanding between Producer and
Distributor with respect to the distribution of the Products and supersedes
and replaces all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with
respect to the same. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
this Agreement shall not be amended or modified except by a written
instrument signed by both Producer and Distributor. It is recognized that
Distributor may from time to time issue a purchase order or other similar
transactional form or document, and that, other than with respect to the
identification of specific quantities of Product being ordered from Producer,
any terms and conditions contained on such forms and documents shall be of no
force and effect, and shall not constitute a modification or amendment of
this Agreement absent Producers specific, written agreement.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties and their respective legal representatives and permitted successors
and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the other partys
prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(c) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, not including the 1980 United Nations
Convention for the International Sale of Goods and notwithstanding the
principles, if any, that would otherwise govern the choice of applicable law.
Each party agrees that any and all litigation it may initiate arising out of
the interpretation, enforcement or breach of any provision of this Agreement
shall be brought in the State of New York in any court having competent
subject matter jurisdiction over such dispute. Additionally, each party
hereby submits itself to the jurisdiction of any court in the State of New
York having competent subject matter jurisdiction.

 

(d) The failure of either party to require the performance of any term or
obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver of either party of any breach of
this Agreement, shall not prevent a subsequent enforcement of such term or
obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach.

 

(e) The section headings used in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only, and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. 

(d) The terms of Sections 4(b), 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17 and this Section
16 (each to the extent applicable after the Term) will survive the expiration
or termination of this Agreement for any reason.

16 EXHIBIT G

 

EXCLUSIVE AGENCY AGREEMENT

THIS EXCLUSIVE AGENCY AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), is dated as of [●], (the
"Effective Date"), by and between Unimin Corporation, a Delaware corporation
[("Producer")][("Agent")] and SCR-Sibelco NV, a Belgian public company
[("Producer")][("Agent")].

WHEREAS, Producer seeks to have Agent serve as its exclusive agent to
promote, market and solicit orders for Producers Products from customers in
the Industries and within the Trading Areas, each as defined below, under the
terms and conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, Agent seeks to promote, market and solicit orders for the sale of the
Products to customers in the Industries within the Trading Areas, and in
accordance with the terms set forth herein;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and provisions
herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is acknowledged by the parties hereto the parties agree
as follows:

 

1\. _Appointment of Sales Agent_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Producer hereby appoints
Agent and Agent hereby accepts appointment as the Producers exclusive sales
agent for the Producer materials listed on the attached Exhibit A ("Products")
for the Industries listed on attached Exhibit B (each, an "Industry") within
the geographical area listed on attached Exhibit C (the "Trading Area"), and
Agent hereby accepts such appointment. Agent shall have the right to solicit
orders for Products only from persons and entities in the Industries and
having their places of business within the Trading Area. Agent shall be the
exclusive agent for the Producer for sale of Products in the Trading Area for
the term of this Agreement. Except as specifically provided herein to the
contrary, any sale of Products in the Industries in the Trading Area shall be
credited as sales made by Agent and Agent shall be entitled to the commission
provided herein. The provisions of this Agreement constitute the entire
agreement and understanding between the parties on the subject matter of this
Agreement, and except as specifically set forth herein, there are no
additional agreements, understandings, representations, covenants, warranties
or guaranties, written or oral, between the parties, relating to the subject
matter of the Agreement. Prior arrangements, agreements and understandings,
if any, are superseded by this Agreement. Agent may appoint any third party to
act as a sub-agent, upon obtaining Producers prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(b) The relationship of the parties created pursuant to this Agreement is, and
is intended to be, that of independent contractors. Agent will not by any
action represent itself as having the authority to assume or create any
obligation or liability on behalf of Producer.

 

2\. _Agent Responsibilities_. The Agent shall:

 

(a) Diligently sample, advertise and promote the sale of the Products to the
Industry in the Trading Area to fulfill the Products sales objectives
mutually established by the parties from time to time;

 



1 (b) Maintain a bona fide sales department adequately staffed, trained and
equipped to enable Agent to serve the Industry in the Trading Area adequately
and properly, to give customers technical sales assistance, address and
resolve customer complaints and to fulfill its other obligations under this
Agreement;

 

(c) Prepare and maintain, and submit to the Producer on a timely basis, all
documentation and reports reasonably required from time to time to be
prepared, maintained or submitted, all in such form and at such times as
Producer may from time to time reasonably request;

(d) Maintain adequate supply of all current literature (including product
data sheets, safety data sheets ("SDS"), brochures, etc.) relating to the
Products and to provide customers and prospective customers with copies of the
same at the time of Product inquiry or order solicitation, acceptance or
thereafter, and, in particular, maintain and provide all customers of Products
with appropriate safety related literature and SDS in full compliance with all
applicable regulatory requirements including, as applicable, the OSHA Hazard
Communication Standard;

(e) Participate in trade shows and exhibitions in the Trading Area where, in
Agents reasonable business judgment, such participation will promote the
Products;

(f) Not make any representation or warranty with respect to any Products,
other than as expressly provided by Producer;

(g) Conduct its business in a professional and ethical manner, and in
compliance with all applicable laws including, without limitation, those
pertaining to taxes and the prohibition of corruption, bribery and the
offering of inducements to public or semi-public officials, including the
United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

(h) Not promote, market or solicit orders for any Products outside the Trading
Area, or inside the Trading Area for use outside the Industries, in each case
where Agent is not authorized to sell such Products, without Producers prior
written consent, which consent may be withheld in Producers absolute
discretion; and,

 

(i) Sell, advertise and promote the Products only to customers in the Industry
within the Trading Area and promptly refer all orders for Products from
outside the Trading Area, and any orders for Products from inside the Trading
Area for use outside the Industry, in each case where Agent is not authorized
to sell such Products, to Producer or its nominee.

 

3\. _Producer s Responsibilities_.

 

(a) Provided Agent is not in breach of any of its obligations under this
Agreement, Producer shall: (i) supply Agent, without charge, with reasonable
quantities of its regular promotional materials relating to the Products,
including safety and technical data sheets, bulletins and such other data as
Producer may from time to time have for promotional purposes; and (ii)
provide Agent with reasonable technical assistance.

(b) Producer shall conduct its business in a professional and ethical manner,
and in compliance with all applicable laws including, without limitation,
those pertaining to taxes and the prohibition of corruption, bribery and the
offering of inducements to public or semi-public officials, including the
United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

 



2 4\. _Quotations, Orders and Payment by Industry Customers_.

 

(a) Agent will make quotations in respect to the sales of the Products only in
accordance with the Producers then current policies and procedures, on
prices agreed between the parties in advance and on the Producers terms and
conditions of sale, including the terms of payment specified by the Producer.
The Agent will assist the Producer in obtaining the appropriate documentation
needed for Industry customers (for example, credit reports, sales tax
exemptions, etc.).

(b) Orders for sales generated by Agent may be submitted to the Producer
either by the Agent or the Industry customer. If Agent receives any order for
Products, it will promptly forward it to the Producer. The Producer will
establish and promulgate the criteria for sales orders to be generated by
Agent and Agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure sales
orders that meet the Producers criteria. The Producer will have the right at
any time to reject any order in whole or in part for good cause. Good cause
shall include the following: (i) the sales order fails to meet the Producers
criteria, (ii) the Industry customer fails to meet the Producers credit
criteria, (iii) lack of Product availability due to no fault of the Producer,
or (iv) poor payment history by the Industry customer.

(c) The Producer will bill the Industry customer for the purchased Products.
Agent will not bill Industry customers for the Products unless expressly
requested to do so by the Producer in writing. Payments against purchase
orders are to be made directly to the Producer, without intervention by Agent
unless expressly requested in writing by the Producer in each instance. If
Agent receives any payment from an Industry customer, Agent will immediately
forward the entire amount of such payment to the Producer.

 

(d) Producer will have the right, in its sole discretion, to issue credits,
make discounts and allowances, and/or accept returns of the Products.

5\. _Commissions_. __

 

(a) The Producer shall pay to the Agent, as compensation for its services
during the Term, a commission of five percent (5%) of Net Sales of Products
generated by Agent to the Industries in the Trading Area for which payment is
received by Producer from any Industry customer. Payment of commission shall
be made by the Producer to Agent on or before 45 days following the calendar
quarter of receipt by Producer of payment for Products from its Industry
customers. At the time of payment of commission, the Producer shall furnish
the Agent with an itemized statement setting forth the computation of
commissions. For purposes of this Agreement, Net Sales means gross sales of
Products by Agent in the Trading Area less: (i) transportation costs; (ii)
replacement costs; (iii) rebates; (iv) warehouse, terminal and handling costs
and (v) import and export fees. 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Producer
shall be obligated to pay commissions only with respect to purchase orders
for Products procured from Industry customers in the Trading Area prior to
termination of this Agreement and subsequently accepted by the Producer and
for which Producer has received payment from the applicable Industry customer.
Any adjustments which may be required pursuant to Section 5(c) hereof shall
be made notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement.

 



3 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, there shall be
deducted from any commissions due the Agent an amount equal to: (i)
commissions previously paid or credited to the Agent for sales of Products
which are thereafter returned by the Industry customer; and (ii) the
applicable portion of commissions previously paid or credited to the Agent
for sales of Products as to which any allowance or adjustment is credited to
the Industry customer for any reason.

 

(d) The Agent and the Producer will agree on an acceptable quarterly expense
level for the Agent. The Producer will pay the agreed upon amount to the
Agent in advance at the beginning of each calendar quarter following receipt
of a proper invoice. Any additional expenditures or extraordinary expenses
must be approved in advance by the Producer in order to be reimbursed.

 

6\. _Trademarks_.

 

(a) The Agent shall not use or register any trademark used by or registered in
the name of Producer, or any affiliate of Producer, ("Producer Trademarks"),
or any word or trademark that is similar in sight, sound or meaning, or
otherwise likely to be confused therewith, in any manner except as permitted
by Producer in connection with the promotion, advertising, and sale of each
of the Products. Agent shall observe all applicable quality standards
specified by Producer as to the manner of use of the Producer Trademarks
applicable to each of the Products being distributed by Agent in the
packaging, labeling, promoting, advertising and/or selling of such Products
by Agent. On Producers request, all packaging, labels, promotional and
advertising materials created by Agent and containing any Producer Trademark,
as well as the promotion of any of the Products with the applicable Producer
Trademark by Agent at any trade show, shall be subject to review and approval
by Producer. Upon termination of this Agreement, Agent shall cease immediately
all use of the Producer Trademarks, and shall remove them or cause them to be
removed from all signs, advertisements, letterheads, bill heads, forms,
listings and any other things on which they may be used by the Agent, and
shall discontinue all representations from which it might be inferred
that Agent is an authorized Agent of any of the Products of Producer. The
Agent acknowledges Producers exclusive ownership of Producer Trademarks and
acquires no right, title or interest in or to the Producer Trademarks
hereunder.

 

(b) Producer hereby grants to the Agent for the Term, and subject to the terms
and conditions herein, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to
use the Producer Trademarks in connection with the marketing and promotion of
the Products in the Trading Area in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and any guidelines issued by Producer from time to time.
During the Term, Agent shall have the right to indicate to the public that it
is an authorized Agent of the Products.

 

7\. _Product Changes_. Producer reserves the right from time to time, in its
absolute discretion, without incurring any liability to the Agent with
respect to any purchase order previously placed or inventory held by Agent, or
otherwise, to discontinue or to limit its production or alter the
specifications of any Product or Product line, to terminate or
limit deliveries of any Product or Product line, the production of which is
so discontinued, limited or altered, and to add new and additional products or
product lines; provided, that, any new products or product lines shall first
be offered to Agent for exclusive agency rights in the Industry in the
Trading Area pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 



4 8\. _Term; Termination_

 

(a) This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall, unless
earlier terminated pursuant to subsections (b) through (e) hereof, continue
for a term of twenty (20) years following the Effective Date ("Term").

(b) Producer may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice to
Agent, if Agents annual volume of orders generated of Products by Industry or
Trading Area fall below the Applicable Minimum for two consecutive calendar
years during the Term; provided however that if Producer has made available
Product volumes less than 2016 levels in such year(s), Producer may only
terminate if Agent failed to generate orders for at least 80% of the Product
supply made available by Producer to Agent in such year(s). For the purposes
of this Agreement, "Applicable Minimum" means the amount set forth on Exhibit
B with respect to each Industry or on Exhibit C with respect to each Trading
Area, as the context requires.

 

(c) Agent may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice to
Producer, if Producer fails to make any payment called for under
this Agreement by the date falling ten (10) days after the due date, and such
failure has continued for twenty (20) or more days after Producer receives
written notice from Agent specifying the failure to pay by such date.

 

(d) Producer may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice to
Agent, if Agent: (i) breaches any of its obligations or restrictions in
Section 2(g), 2(i), 2(h) or 6; or (ii) for any reason, suffers the loss of any
license or permit required by law that is necessary for Agent to carry out any
of its obligations under this Agreement, and such loss has continued for
thirty (30) or more days.

(e) Either party may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice
to the other party (i) if such other party fails to observe or perform any of
its obligations in this Agreement (other than those obligations addressed in
Section 8(b) or 8(c)), and such failure has continued for thirty (30) or more
days after such party receives written notice from the other party specifying
the nature of the alleged breach; (ii) if such other party voluntarily
commences any proceeding or files a petition seeking liquidation,
reorganization or other relief under any bankruptcy, receivership or similar
law; or (iii) if an involuntary proceeding is commenced or petition is filed
against such other party seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief
in respect of such party under any bankruptcy, receivership or similar law,
and such proceeding or petition is not dismissed within sixty (60) days after
first initiated.

(f) This Agreement, and all obligations, terms and conditions contained
herein, shall automatically terminate without any further action required by
any party upon [Producer][Agent], directly or indirectly, ceasing to own more
than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of
[Producer][Agent].1

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a
termination is based on Section 8(b), 8(c) or 8(d) and the circumstance giving
rise to such termination is



 



   1  |

Note to draft: Select appropriate parties for execution version.  

---|--- 
 



5  attributable to only a particular Industry or jurisdiction of the Trading
Area, then the termination may only apply to such particular Industry or
jurisdiction. If this Agreement is only terminated in part, it will continue
in full force and effect with respect to the remaining Industry(ies) and
jurisdictions of the Trading Area.

 

9\. _Rights on Termination_. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Agent
shall cease all marketing and promotion of, and the solicitation of purchase
orders for, the Products and promptly return to the Producer all promotional
literature, data sheets, sales aids and other similar materials or effects
which the Producer may have furnished to the Agent in connection with its
activities hereunder. Upon any termination of this Agreement, the Producer
shall not be liable to the Agent for loss of future commissions, goodwill,
investments, advertising or promotional costs or like expenses.
Neither Producer nor the Agent shall, by reason of the termination or non-
renewal of the Agents agency, be liable to the other for any indemnification,
compensation, reimbursement or damages on account of the loss of prospective
profits on anticipated sales, or on account of expenditures, investments,
leases or commitments in connection with the business or goodwill of Producer
or the Agent, or otherwise. Irrespective of whether such obligations
or liabilities may be contemplated in the laws of the Trading Area or
elsewhere, both parties hereby waive any rights (if any) each may have to such
indemnification, compensation, reimbursement and damages in the event of the
termination or nonrenewal of the Agents agency.

10\. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 11, Agent will indemnify, defend and hold Producer
harmless from and against any and all claims and demands in each case made by
third parties and all resulting liabilities, obligations, costs, losses and
expenses, including court or arbitration costs and reasonable attorneys and
experts fees, that Producer may suffer to the extent resulting from
or arising out of: (i) any breach by Agent (or any sub-agent) of any of its
obligations or any of its representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement; (ii) any unauthorized act of Agent, its sub-agent, or any of their
agents or employees; (iii) the negligent acts or omissions or willful
misconduct of Agent or its sub-agents; or (iv) the relationship between Agent
and any of its sub-agents (even if approved in accordance with Section 1(a)),
or the termination thereof. At Producers election, in its sole discretion,
Agent will take reasonable steps to defend Producer with respect to any claim
by a third party that is subject to the foregoing indemnity obligation in any
action, suit or other proceeding and select counsel that is reasonably
satisfactory to Producer, and Producer may participate in (at Producers
expense) all aspects of, any such proceeding, including any settlement thereof
(subject to Section 10(b)). Where Producer elects to defend the claim, Agent
may participate (at its expense) in all aspects of any proceeding, including
any settlement of the claim (subject to Section 10(b)).

(b) The indemnified party will provide prompt written notice of a claim to
the indemnifying party; provided that the failure of any indemnified party to
give notice will not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under
this Section 10, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by such failure to give notice. The indemnifying party agrees to
timely reimburse the indemnified party for expenses incurred in connection
with a claim for which the indemnified party is entitled to
indemnification under this Section 10\. The party that has assumed the
defense of any claim pursuant to Section 10(a) may not settle the claim
without the written consent of the other

 



6  party unless (i) the terms of such settlement do not impose any obligations
or restrictions on the indemnified party, (ii) the full amount of any monetary
settlement is paid by the indemnifying party, and (iii) the indemnified party
receives as part of such settlement a legal, binding and enforceable
unconditional release providing that such third party claim and any claimed
liability of the indemnified party with respect to the third party claim is
fully satisfied by reason of such settlement and that the indemnified party is
being released from any and all obligations and liabilities it may have with
respect to the third party claim.

 

11\. _Limitations on Liability_. Neither Producer nor the Agent shall, by
reason of the termination or non-renewal of the Agents agency be liable to
the other for any indemnification, compensation, reimbursement or damages on
account of the loss of prospective profits on anticipated sales, or on account
of expenditures, investments, leases or commitments in connection with the
business or goodwill of Producer or the Agent, or otherwise. Irrespective of
whether such obligations or liabilities may be contemplated in the laws of the
Trading Area or elsewhere, both parties hereby waive any rights (if any) each
may have to such indemnification, compensation, reimbursement and damages in
the event of the termination or non-renewal of the Agents agency. Neither
party shall be liable to the other party for any special, incidental,
consequential, indirect or punitive damages (including loss of (anticipated)
profits) arising in any way out of this Agreement, however caused and on any
theory of liability, except with respect to claims based on intentional fraud
or intentional misconduct. For the avoidance of doubt, if any of the foregoing
damages are awarded to a third party and a party has a right to bring a claim
against the other party under this Agreement in respect of such third party
claim, such damages will be considered direct damages.

12.  _Notice_. Except for purchase orders and invoices, which may be sent by
e-mail or such other written means as the parties may agree from time to time,
all notices to be given hereunder shall be deemed sufficient if in writing
and sent to the addresses set forth below, or to such other addresses as may
be subsequently designated by the parties in the manner provided herein, by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or
by nationally recognized overnight courier service: 2

7 13\. _Excusable  Non-Performance_. A party shall not be liable for failure to
perform any part of this Agreement, except for the payment of money (which
obligation is not affected by this Section 13), to the extent and duration
that such failure to perform is on account of Acts of God or any government,
fire, strike, labor dispute, accident, war, insurrection, embargoes, delays of
carriers or suppliers, or for any other causes beyond such partys reasonable
control or without its fault ("Force Majeure"). In the case of any delay or
failure that either party anticipates will cause an excusable delay hereunder,
such party will, within ten (10) days of becoming aware of such delay or
failure, give the other party written notice thereof, including a description
of the steps (if any) such party is taking to alleviate the underlying issue.

 

14\. _General_.

(a) This Agreement, including the attached Exhibits, which are incorporated
herein, contains the entire agreement and understanding between Producer and
Agent with respect to the Agents agency and supersedes and replaces all prior
agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to the same.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not be amended or modified except by a written instrument signed by both
Producer and Agent. It is recognized that Agent may from time to time issue
transactional forms or documents, and that any terms and conditions contained
on such forms and documents shall be of no force and effect, and shall not
constitute a modification or amendment of this Agreement absent Producers
specific, written agreement.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties and their respective legal representatives and permitted successors
and assigns. The rights and obligations of Agent hereunder may not be
assigned, delegated, or transferred without the prior written consent of
Producer, and any attempted assignment, delegation or transfer in violation
of this provision shall be void and automatically terminate this Agreement.

(c) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, not including the 1980 United Nations
Convention for the International Sale of Goods and notwithstanding the
principles, if any, that would otherwise govern the choice of applicable law.
Each party agrees that any and all litigation it may initiate arising out of
the interpretation, enforcement or breach of any provision of this Agreement
shall be brought in the State of New York in any court having competent
subject matter jurisdiction over such dispute. Additionally, each party hereby
submits itself to the jurisdiction of any court in the State of New York
having competent subject matter jurisdiction.

 

(d) The failure of either party to require the performance of any term or
obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver of either party of any breach of

in association with any other person, own, manage, operate, control,
participate in, acquire (or have the right to acquire) voting securities of,
perform services for, or otherwise carry on, any business involved with any
activities other than those set out in _Section_ __ _ 1.2(a)_ above

provisions shall not be deemed void, and the Parties hereto agree that said
limits may be modified by the court and that said covenant(s) contained in
this _Article I_ will be amended in accordance with said modification, it
being specifically agreed by the Parties that it is their continuing desire
that these covenants be enforced to the full extent of their terms and

ARTICLE III

 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 3.1 Termination of this Agreement

This Agreement, and all obligations, terms and conditions contained herein,
shall automatically terminate without any further action required by any
Party upon either (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms, or (ii) Sibelco, together with its controlled Affiliates,
ceasing to own more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of common

Section 3.2 Effect of Termination

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability on
the part of any Party; _provided_ , however, no such termination shall relieve
any Party from any liability for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior
to such termination and the provisions of this _Article III_ , shall survive
any such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, termination of this
Agreement shall not prevent any Party from seeking any remedies (at law or in
equity) against the other Party for that Partys breach of any of the terms of
this Agreement prior to the date of termination.

 

Section 3.3 Entire Agreement; Assignment.

This Agreement (together with the Merger Agreement, the Distribution
Agreement and the Agency Agreement, to the extent referred to in this
Agreement) and any documents delivered by the Parties in connection herewith
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any person other than the

 



4  Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any
Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

Section 3.4 Amendments and Waivers

This Agreement may only be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment
or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by each
Party, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to
be effective. No failure or delay by Sibelco or Unimin in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder.

Section 3.5 Notices

 

All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, or, if confirmed, faxed or emailed, or sent by overnight courier

Section 3.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial



   (a) | This Agreement and all Actions (whether based on contract, tort
or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of
Sibelco or Unimin in the negotiation, administration, performance
and enforcement thereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under any applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | In any Action between the Parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Parties (i) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware or any federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware; (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such
court; and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any such action in any court
other than the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in and for New
Castle County, Delaware, or any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware and appellate courts thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred
to in this _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ in any such Action by mailing copies thereof
by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_.
However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a Party to effect service
of process on the other party by any other legally available method. 
---|--- 



   (c) | EACH OF UNIMIN AND SIBELCO WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. 
---|--- 

Section 3.7 Specific Performance

 

The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an 

 



6  injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement
in any court referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ above, without proof of
actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any such breach.

Section 3.8 Counterparts; Effectiveness

 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered (including
by electronic transmission) to the Parties.

Section 3.9 Headings 

The headings, table of contents and index of defined terms contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 3.10 Severability

 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

 

Section 3.11 Interpretation

When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit,
such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto,"
"hereby," "herein" __ and "hereunder _"_ __ and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive.
The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply
"if." All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of
such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to a person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to dollars _ _ and $ will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States of America.

the Corporation, SCR-Sibelco NV ( _Sierra_ ) and the Stockholders named
therein (the _Stockholders Agreement_ ), the following provisions shall apply
with respect to Common Stock:

 



3 i. Each share of Common Stock shall have identical rights and privileges in
every respect. Common Stock shall be subject to the express terms of
Preferred Stock and any series thereof. Except as may otherwise be provided in
this AandR Certificate, in a Preferred Stock Designation or by applicable law,
the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each
such share upon all questions presented to the Stockholders, the holders of
shares of Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election
of members of the Board of Directors (each such member, a _Director_ ) and
for all other purposes, and the holders of Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to vote at or receive notice of any meeting of Stockholders. Each
holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to notice of any Stockholders
meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation (the _Bylaws_ , as in
effect at the time in question) and applicable law on all matters put to a
vote of the Stockholders.

 

ii. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law,
holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on
any amendment to this AandR Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding
series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled,
either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such
series, to vote thereon pursuant to this AandR Certificate (including any
Preferred Stock Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL (or any successor
provision thereto).

 

iii. Subject to the prior rights and preferences, if any, applicable to shares
of Preferred Stock or any series thereof, the holders of shares of Common
Stock shall be entitled to receive ratably in proportion to the number of
shares of Common Stock held by them such dividends and distributions (payable
in cash, stock or otherwise), if any, as may be declared thereon by the Board
of Directors at any time and from time to time out of any funds of the
Corporation legally available therefor.

iv. Except as otherwise provided in a Preferred Stock Designation, in the
event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the Corporation, after distribution in full of the preferential amounts,
if any, to be distributed to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or any
class or series thereof, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive all of the remaining assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to the Stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of
shares of Common Stock held by them. Except as otherwise provided in a
Preferred Stock Designation, a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
the Corporation, as such terms are used in this Paragraph (d), shall not be
deemed to be occasioned by or to include any consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations or other entity
or a sale, lease, exchange or conveyance of all or a part of the assets of
the Corporation.

v. Except as otherwise provided in a Preferred Stock Designation, the number
of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or
decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the 

 



4  holders of a majority in voting power of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2)
of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders
of either Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall
be required therefor.

3. General.

a. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this AandR Certificate, any then-
existing Preferred Stock Designation and the Stockholders Agreement, the
Corporation may issue shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock from time to
time for such consideration (not less than the par value thereof) as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors, which is expressly authorized to fix the
same in its sole and absolute discretion subject to the foregoing conditions.
Shares so issued for which the consideration shall have been paid or delivered
to the Corporation shall be deemed fully paid stock and shall not be liable to
any further call or assessment thereon, and the holders of such shares shall
not be liable for any further payments in respect of such shares.

 

b. Subject to the Stockholders Agreement, the Corporation shall have authority
to create and issue rights and options entitling their holders to purchase
shares of the Corporations capital stock of any class or series or other
securities of the Corporation, and such rights and options shall be evidenced
by instrument(s) approved by the Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors shall be empowered to set the exercise price, duration, times for
exercise, and other terms of such options or rights; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the consideration to be received for any shares of capital stock subject
thereto shall not be less than the par value thereof.

c. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any
share of its stock is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes and
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest
in, such share on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation
shall have notice thereof, except as expressly provided by applicable law.

FIFTH. Subject to the Stockholders Agreement, the total number of Directors
shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of
Directors. Each Director shall serve for a term of one year or until his or
her earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

SIXTH. Prior to the earlier of (i) the close of business on the tenth business
day following the date on which Sierra and its affiliates (as such term is
used in the Stockholders Agreement) no longer beneficially own more than 50%
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and (ii) the close of business on
the business day following public announcement by Sierra that Sierra has made
an election that the "Trigger Date" has occurred (the earlier of (i) and
(ii), the _Trigger Date_ ), any action required or permitted to be taken at
any annual meeting or special meeting of 

 



5  the Stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote of Stockholders, if a consent or consents in writing, setting
forth the action so taken, is or are signed by the holders of outstanding
stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary
to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to
vote thereon were present and voted. On and after the Trigger Date, subject
to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any action required
or permitted to be taken by the Stockholders must be taken at a duly held
annual or special meeting of Stockholders and may not be taken by any consent
in writing of such Stockholders.

SEVENTH. Special meetings of Stockholders may be called only by the Board of
Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number
of Directors which the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Trigger Date, special meetings of
the Stockholders may also be called by the Secretary of the Corporation at
the request of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock. From and after the Trigger Date, and subject to the rights of
holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the Stockholders do not have the
power to call a special meeting of Stockholders.

EIGHTH. In furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the powers conferred by
the DGCL, subject to the Stockholders Agreement, the Board of Directors is
expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws shall
not be adopted, altered, amended or repealed by the Stockholders (i) prior to
the Trigger Date, except by the affirmative vote of holders of not less than
a majority in voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors (considered for this
purpose as one class) or (ii) after the Trigger Date, except by the
affirmative vote of holders of not less than 66 2/3% in voting power of the
then-outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote generally in the
election of Directors (considered for this purpose as one class).

NINTH. Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the
Corporation and the Stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary
way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on
the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation
under the provisions of Section 291 of the DGCL or on the application of
trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the
Corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of the DGCL order a meeting
of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the Stockholders or class of
Stockholders, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said
court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of
the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the Stockholders or class of
Stockholders, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and
to any reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise
or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization
shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made,
be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the
Stockholders or class of Stockholders, as the case may be, and also on the
Corporation.

 



6 TENTH. No Director shall be liable to the Corporation or the Stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director, except to the
extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted
under the DGCL as it now exists. In addition to the circumstances in which a
Director is not personally liable as set forth in the preceding sentence, a
Director shall not be liable to the fullest extent permitted by any amendment
to the DGCL hereafter enacted that further limits the liability of a Director.

 

The Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to each Director or
Officer to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL.

 

Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article Tenth shall be
prospective only and shall not affect any limitation on liability of a
Director for acts or omissions occurring prior to the date of such amendment,
repeal or modification.

ELEVENTH. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation,
on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy
of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity
to participate in, the business opportunities that are from time to
time presented to Sierra or any of its officers, directors, agents, members,
affiliates and subsidiaries (other than the Corporation and its subsidiaries)
(each, a _Specified Party_ ), or are business opportunities in which a
Specified Party participates or desires to participate, even if the
opportunity is one that the Corporation or its subsidiaries might reasonably
be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted
the opportunity to do so, and each such Specified Party shall have no duty to
communicate or offer such business opportunity to the Corporation and, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall not be liable to the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or any stockholder, for breach of any
fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or controlling stockholder
or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such Specified Party pursues or
acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to
another person or fails to present such business opportunity, or information
regarding such business opportunity, to the Corporation or its subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Specified Party who is a Director and who is
offered any business opportunity in his or her capacity as a Director or
Officer (a _Directed Opportunity_ ) shall be obligated to communicate such
Directed Opportunity to the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that all of
the protections of this Article Eleventh shall otherwise apply to the
Specified Parties with respect to such Directed Opportunity, including,
without limitation, the ability of the Specified Parties to pursue or acquire
such Directed Opportunity or to direct such Directed Opportunity to another
person.

 



7 Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article Eleventh, nor the adoption of
any provision of this AandR Certificate or the Bylaws, nor, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, any modification of law, shall eliminate,
reduce or otherwise adversely affect any right or protection of any person
granted pursuant hereto existing at, or arising out of or related to any
event, act or omission that occurred prior to, the time of such amendment,
repeal, adoption or modification (regardless of when any proceeding (or part
thereof) relating to such event, act or omission arises or is
first threatened, commenced or completed).

If any provision or provisions of this Article Eleventh shall be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any
reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of such
provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this
Article Eleventh (including, without limitation, each portion of any
paragraph of this Article Eleventh containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby
and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article
Eleventh (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of
this Article Eleventh containing any such provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation
to protect the Directors, Officers, its employees and agents from personal
liability in respect of their good faith service to or for the benefit of the
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

This Article Eleventh shall not limit any protections or defenses available
to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any Director or Officer
under this AandR Certificate, the Bylaws or applicable law. Any person or entity
purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any securities of the
Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the
provisions of this Article Eleventh.

TWELFTH. The Corporation elects not to be governed by, and shall not be
subject to the provisions of, Section 203 of the DGCL, as now in effect or
hereafter amended, or any successor statute thereto, as permitted under and
pursuant to subsection (b)(3) thereof.

 

THIRTEENTH. The Corporation shall have the right, subject to any express
provisions or restrictions contained in this AandR Certificate, the Bylaws or
the Stockholders Agreement, from time to time, to amend this AandR Certificate
or any provision hereof in any manner now or hereafter provided by law, and
all rights and powers of any kind conferred upon a Director or Stockholder by
this AandR Certificate or any amendment hereof are subject to such right of the
Corporation.

FOURTEENTH. Notwithstanding any other provision of this AandR Certificate or
the Bylaws (and in addition to any other vote that may be required by law,
this AandR Certificate, the Bylaws or the Stockholders Agreement), following the
Trigger Date, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting
power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote generally in
the election of Directors (voting together as one class) shall be required to
amend, alter or repeal ARTICLES FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, ELEVENTH and
FOURTEENTH of this AandR Certificate or to adopt any provision inconsistent
therewith.

 



8 FIFTEENTH. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for
(i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation,
(ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any
Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or
the Stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation
arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this AandR Certificate or the
Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation governed
by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to said Court of
Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as
defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have
notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article Fifteenth.

Corporations registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust
Company. The registered office and registered agent of the Corporation may be

1.3 _Books and Records_. The books and records of the Corporation may be kept
outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may from time to time
be designated by the Board.

ARTICLE 2

_STOCKHOLDERS_

2.1  _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation shall be held on such date and at such place, if any, either
within or without the State of Delaware, and time as may be fixed by
resolution of the Board, unless, subject to the Corporations Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation as it may be further amended and
restated from time to time (the _Certificate of Incorporation_ ), the
stockholders have acted by written consent as permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, or any successor provisions thereto ( _DGCL_ ). Any
proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting. The Board may
postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of stockholders previously
scheduled by the Board.

2.2 _Special Meeting_. Special meetings of stockholders may be called in the
manner provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. The Board may postpone,
reschedule or cancel any special meeting of the stockholders previously
scheduled by the Board. 2.3 _Record Date_.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which
record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than
sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If
the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board
determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or
before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such
determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case
shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned
meeting.

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record
date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such
record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 

(c) Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, in order
that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record
date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date
for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action
in writing without a meeting is fixed by the Board, (i) when no prior action
of the Board is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be the
first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or
proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with
applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by the Board is required by law, the
record date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

 



2 2.4 _Stock List_. A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any
meeting of stockholders (provided, however, if the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days
before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders
entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in
alphabetical order for each class of stock and showing the address of each
such stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of such
stockholder, shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any
purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior
to the meeting, either on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided
that the information required to gain access to the list is provided with the
notice of the meeting, or during ordinary business hours, at the principal
place of business of the Corporation. The stock list shall also be produced
and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof,
and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to
be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be
open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the
meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information
required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
The stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the only evidence as to who are
the stockholders entitled by this section to examine the list required by
this section or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of the
stockholders.

2.5 _Place of Meeting_. The Board shall designate the place of meeting for
any annual meeting or for any special meeting of the stockholders. If no
designation is so made, the place of meeting shall be the principal executive
offices of the Corporation. The Board, acting in its sole discretion, may
establish guidelines and procedures in accordance with applicable provisions
of the DGCL and any other applicable law for the participation by stockholders
and proxyholders in a meeting of stockholders by means of
remote communications, and may determine that any meeting of stockholders
will not be held at any place but will be held solely by means of remote
communication. Stockholders and proxyholders complying with such procedures
and guidelines and otherwise entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
shall be deemed present in person and entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or
solely by means of remote communication.

 



3 2.6 _Notice of Meeting_. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to
take any action at a meeting, notice of the meeting, stating the place, day
and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which
stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed present in person and vote at such
meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for
which the meeting is called, shall be given. Unless otherwise provided by law,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the notice shall be given
not less than ten (10) days nor more than 60 days before the date of the
meeting, in a manner pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ hereof, to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date
for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. If
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the
United States mail with postage thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder
at his address as it appears on books of the Corporation. The Corporation
may provide stockholders with notice of a meeting by electronic transmission
in accordance with applicable law.

2.7 _Quorum and Adjournment of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by
law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the holders of a
majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled
to vote at the meeting (the _Voting Stock_ ), represented in person or by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. Where a
separate vote by a class or series (or classes or series) of stock is
required, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class
or series (or classes or series), represented in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum of such class or series with respect to the vote on that
matter. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to
another corporation, if a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled
to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation are held,
directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote
nor be counted by quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the
Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by
it in fiduciary capacity. The chairman of the meeting or the holders of a
majority in voting power of the shares so represented at a meeting may adjourn
the meeting from time to time, whether or not there is such a quorum. When a
meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these Bylaws otherwise
require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and
place, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, a
notice shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the
meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of
stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board
shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to receive
notice of the adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for
determination of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the adjourned
meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder
of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date so
fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At the adjournment meeting, the
Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the
original meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called meeting at which a
quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than
a quorum.

 



4 2.8 _Proxies_. At all meetings of stockholders, each stockholder entitled to
vote at a meeting may authorize another person to act for such stockholder by
proxy given in any manner permitted by law. Any copy, facsimile transmission
or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant
to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or
transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile transmission or
other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original
writing or transmission. No proxy may be voted or acted upon after the
expiration of three (3) years from the date of such proxy, unless such proxy
provides for a longer period. Every proxy is revocable at the pleasure of the
stockholder executing it unless the proxy states that it is irrevocable and
applicable law makes it irrevocable. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that
is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing
an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by filing another duly executed
proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary.

quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the
meeting in the place of the absent or disqualified member.

such other duties as from time to time may be assigned to him by the Board,
the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer.

5.9 _Vacancies_. A newly created elected office and a vacancy in any elected
office because of death, resignation, or removal may be filled by the Board

ARTICLE 6

_STOCK CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFERS_

6.1 _Stock Certificates and Transfers_. Shares of stock of the Corporation
shall be represented by certificates,  _provided_ that the Board may provide
by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series
of its stock may be uncertificated shares. The shares of the stock of the
Corporation shall be entered in the books of the Corporation as they are
issued and shall exhibit the holders name and number of shares. Subject to
the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the shares of the stock of
the Corporation shall be transferred on the books of the Corporation, which
may be maintained by a third party registrar or transfer agent, by the holder
thereof in person or by his attorney, upon, in the case of certificated
shares, surrender for cancellation of certificates for at least the same
number of shares, with an assignment and power of transfer endorsed thereon
or attached thereto, duly executed, with such proof of the authenticity of the
signature as the Corporation or its agents may reasonably require and, in the
case of uncertificated shares, upon receipt of proper transfer instructions
from the registered holder of uncertificated shares and upon compliance with
appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form, at
which time the Corporation shall issue a new certificate (or uncertificated
share(s)) to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate(s), if
any, and record the transaction upon its books.

 

Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a
certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman of
the Board or Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or the President or a Vice
President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or
an Assistant Secretary, of the

 



17  Corporation certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the
Corporation. Any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be a
facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or
whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be
such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued,
it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such
officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue

6.2 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new
certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in place of any certificate
theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, destroyed or stolen, and
the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, or such owners legal representative, to give the Corporation a
bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it
on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate
or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

6.3 _Ownership of Shares_. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the
holder of record of any share or shares of capital stock of the Corporation
as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound to
recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares
on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or
other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of
Delaware.

6.4  _Regulations Regarding Certificates_. Subject to applicable law, the
Board shall have the power and authority to make all such rules and
regulations as they may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and
registration or the replacement of certificates for shares of capital stock
of the Corporation. The Corporation may enter into additional agreements with
stockholders to restrict the transfer of stock of the Corporation in any
manner not prohibited by the DGCL.

 

ARTICLE 7

day of January and end on the thirty-first day of December of each year and
may be changed by resolution of the Board.

Incorporation, the Board may from time to time declare, and the Corporation
may pay, dividends on its outstanding shares of capital stock, which dividends
may be paid in either cash, property or shares of capital stock of the
Corporation. A member of the Board, or a member of any committee designated by
the Board shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records
of the Corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements
presented to the Corporation by any of its officers or employees, or
committees of the Board, or by any other person as to matters the director
reasonably believes are within such other persons professional or expert
competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of
the Corporation, as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities and/or
net profits of the Corporation, or any other facts pertinent to the existence
and amount of surplus or other funds from which dividends might properly be
declared and paid.

 



18 7.3 _Seal_. The corporate seal shall have enscribed thereon the words
"Corporate Seal," the year of incorporation and around the margin thereof the
words "Unimin Corporation  Delaware."

7.4  _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given to any
stockholder or director of the Corporation under the provisions of the DGCL,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing,
including by electronic transmission, signed by the person or persons
entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein,
shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business
to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual or special meeting of the
stockholders or the Board or committee thereof need be specified in any waiver
of notice of such meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened and does not further participate in the meeting.

 

7.5 _Resignation_. Any director or any officer, whether elected or appointed,
may resign at any time by giving written notice, including by electronic
transmission, of such resignation to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary, and such resignation shall
be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the date said notice
is received by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the
President or the Secretary, or at such later time as is specified therein. No
formal action shall be required of the Board or the stockholders to make any
such resignation effective.

7.6 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Scope_

(i) Each person who was or is a party, is threatened to be made a party to or
is involved in any Proceeding (other than a Proceeding by or in the right of
the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he
or she is the legal representative is or was, or has agreed to become, a
director or officer of a Subject Enterprise or by reason of any act or
omission by such person in such capacity, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted
the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all Expenses and
liabilities which were suffered or reasonably incurred by such person in
connection therewith, so long as such person acted in good faith and in a
manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests
of the Corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was unlawful. Such
indemnification shall inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors
and administrators.

 



19 (ii) Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is involved in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the
Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he
or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative is or was, or
has agreed to become, a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of a
Subject Enterprise, or by reason of any act or omission by such person in such
capacity, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent authorized by the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such
amendment), against all Expenses suffered or incurred by such person in
connection therewith, so long as such person acted in good faith and in a
manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation. Such indemnification shall inure to the benefit of such
persons heirs, executors and administrators.

(iii) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 7.6(a)(ii)_, no indemnification shall
be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall
have been finally adjudged to be liable to the Corporation in a final
adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction, unless and to the extent
that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the court in which
such Proceeding shall have been brought or is pending, shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled
to indemnification.

(iv) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 7.6(a)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _
7.6(a)(ii)_, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_ or the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person, including any Proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person against the Corporation or its directors, officers,
employees or other indemnitees only if (i) such Proceeding (or part thereof)
was authorized by the Board prior to its initiation or (ii) the Corporation,
by action of its Board, provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion,
pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under applicable law.

(v) The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law,
advance all Expenses incurred by a present or former director or officer in
defending any Proceeding prior to the final disposition of such Proceeding
upon written request of such person and delivery of an undertaking by
such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that
such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Such
advances shall be paid by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after the
receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the claimant
requesting such advance or advances from time to time.

 



20 (b) The Corporation may, by action of its Board, provide indemnification and
advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation,
individually or as a group, within the same scope and effect as the
indemnification of its directors and officers.

 

(c) To obtain indemnification or advancement of Expenses under these Bylaws, a
claimant shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including
documentation and information which is reasonably available to the claimant
and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the
claimant is entitled to indemnification following the final disposition of
such action, suit or proceeding. Upon written request by a claimant who is a
current director and officer of the Corporation for indemnification pursuant
to the first sentence of this paragraph (c), a determination by the
Corporation, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimants
entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (i) by a majority vote of the
Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a
quorum of the Board, (ii) by a committee of Disinterested Directors
designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less
than a quorum, (iii) if there are no such Disinterested Directors, or, if such
Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written
opinion, or (iv) if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the
Corporation. The Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Corporation;
_provided, however_ , that the claimant may, within ten (10) days after
written notice of selection shall be given, deliver to the Corporation
written objection to such selection, which may only be asserted on the grounds
that the Independent Counsel does not meet the definition of Independent
Counsel as defined by these Bylaws. Such determination of entitlement to
indemnification shall be made not later than ninety (90) days after receipt by
the Corporation of a written request for indemnification. If it is so
determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the
claimant shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination. In any
proceeding brought to enforce the right of a person to receive indemnification
to which such person is entitled under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, the
person, persons or entity making such determination shall, to the fullest
extent not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable law and these Bylaws
presume that such person is entitled to indemnification and the Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proof
to overcome that presumption. A prior determination by the Corporation
(including the Board or any committee thereof, its independent legal counsel,
or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard
of conduct does not itself constitute evidence that the claimant has not met
the applicable standard of conduct. In any proceeding brought to enforce a
claim for advances to which a person is entitled under _Section_ __ _ 7.6(a_
_)(_ _v)_ , the person seeking an advance need only show that he or she has
satisfied the requirements expressly set forth in  _Section_ __ _
7.6(a)(v)_.

(d) If the Board or the Independent Counsel, as applicable, shall have failed
to make a determination as to entitlement to indemnification within ninety
(90) days after receipt by the Corporation of such request, such claimant
shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of such claimants option to
such entitlement. Alternatively, such claimant, at his option, may seek an
award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the

 



21  American Arbitration Association. The termination of any Proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere
or its equivalent, shall not, of itself: (i) create a presumption that the
claimant did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or,
with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that the claimant had reasonable
cause to believe that the claimants conduct was unlawful; or (ii) otherwise
adversely affect the rights of the claimant to indemnification, except as may
be provided herein. All Expenses incurred by such person in connection with
successfully establishing such persons right to indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, in whole or in part,
shall also be indemnified by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted
by law.

(e) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.6(c)_ of these Bylaws that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the
Corporation shall be bound by such determination and shall be precluded from
asserting that such determination has not been made in any judicial Proceeding
commenced pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_ of these Bylaws.

(f) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial
Proceeding commenced pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_ of these Bylaws that
the procedures and presumptions of these Bylaws are not valid, binding and
enforceable and shall stipulate in such Proceeding that the Corporation is
bound by all the provisions of these Bylaws.

(g) The right to indemnification and the payment of Expenses incurred in
defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in these
Bylaws shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested
Directors or otherwise. No repeal or modification of these Bylaws shall in any
way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any occurrence or
matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification.

(h) If any provision or provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ shall be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.6_ (including, without limitation, each portion of any
paragraph of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ containing any such provision held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ (including, without limitation, each such portion of
any paragraph of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give
effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable. If this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless (A) indemnify each director and officer of the
Corporation as to Expenses and liabilities paid in settlement with respect to
any Proceeding, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation,

 



22  and (B) advance Expenses to each director or officer of the Corporation
entitled to advancement of expenses under _Section_ __ _ 7.6(a)(v)_ in
accordance therewith, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by any
applicable portion of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ that shall not have been
invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is

customarily incurred in connection with the prosecuting, defending, preparing
to prosecute or defend, investigating, being or preparing to be a witness in,
or otherwise participating in, a Proceeding. Expenses also shall include,
without limitation, (1) expenses incurred in connection with any appeal
resulting from, incurred by the claimant in connection with, arising out of,
or in respect of or relating to any cost bond, supersedeas bond, or other
appeal bond or its equivalent, (2) expenses incurred by the claimant in
connection with interpretation, enforcement or defense of such claimants
rights, by litigation or otherwise, (3) any federal, state, local or foreign
taxes imposed on the claimant as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of
any payments under these Bylaws, and (4) any interest, assessments or other
changes in respect of the foregoing.

 

(C) _Independent Counsel_ means a law firm of at least 50 attorneys or a

affiliate thereof in any matter material to either such party or (2) any
other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall
not include any person who, under the applicable standards of
professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in
representing either the Corporation or the claimant in an action to determine
the claimants right to indemnification under these Bylaws.
