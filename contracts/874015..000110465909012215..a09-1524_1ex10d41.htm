shall equal an average of Ibis Net Sales for similar quantities of Products
sold or Services provided within the same calendar quarter in an arms length
transaction in the same geographic market and class of purchasers or Service
recipients as the non-arms length purchaser or Service recipient.

  



  

2\. In the event that a Product is sold or a Service provided in combination
with any other product(s) or service(s), Ibis Net Sales with respect to the
Product or Service of the combination shall be determined by the fraction A
over A + B in which "A" is Ibis Net Sales of the Product or Service portion
of the combination when sold separately during the applicable calendar
quarter, and "B" is Ibis Net Sales of the other product(s) or service(s) of
the combination product or service when sold separately during the applicable
calendar quarter.

  



        
   

  



  

3\. In the event a Product or Service is incorporated into a profile in which
said Product or Service contributes only a small proportion of the value of
the total package, but the adjustment set forth in paragraph 2, above is
impractical or if similar quantities of product(s) are not sold or similar
quantities of Services are not provided pursuant to paragraph 1, above, then
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to establish an equitable
adjustment to Ibis Net Sales for such Product or Service to fairly reflect
the proportion of the value of the profile contributed by the Product or
Service or the value of the Product or Service.

Closing Date until December 31, 2025 (the " _Earnout Period_ "), Ibis will
pay to Isis an amount equal to five percent (5%) (the " _Earnout Rate_ ") of
cumulative Ibis Net Sales that are (i) in excess of the Earnout Threshold and
(ii) less than or equal to $2,100,000,000. Such amounts payable to Isis will
be reduced by an amount equal to [***] of any [***], but in no event will
such amounts for such Ibis Net Sales be less than two and a half percent
(2.5%) of such cumulative Ibis Net Sales.

  

### 

  

### (b) For cumulative Ibis Net Sales during the Earnout Period that are in
excess of $2,100,000,000, the Earnout Rate will reduce from 5% to 3%.  The
corresponding amounts payable to Isis will be reduced by an amount equal to
[***] of any [***], but in no event will such amounts for such Ibis Net Sales
be less than one and a half percent (1.5%) of such cumulative Ibis Net Sales.

  

### 

  

### (c) In calculating the amount of any reduction to the earn-out payments
permitted by the second sentence of either _Section 2.3(a)_ or _Section
2.3(b)_ that result from any [***] that are [***], the amount of such [***]
[***] will be [***] of the Earnout Period from the date of such [***]. For
example, if Ibis makes a [***] in the form of [***] equal to [***] to [***]
which, in AMIs reasonable judgment was [***] and such [***] was made in
2015, then, in each calendar quarter, Ibis would be able to reduce the
corresponding amounts

  



        
   

  



  

### payable for such quarter by [***], in each case subject to the applicable
2.5% or 1.5% floor under _Section 2.3(a)_ or  _Section 2.3(b)_.

  

### 

  

### (d) The earnout amounts described in _Sections 2.3(a)_ and _2.3(b)_
will be payable on a quarterly basis, within [***] days after the last day of
each calendar quarter, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Isis. Within [***] [***] days of the end of each
calendar quarter, Ibis will deliver to Isis its non-binding, preliminary,
good faith estimate of Ibis Net Sales for such calendar quarter. All amounts
included in Ibis Net Sales shall be in United States funds collectible at par
in Chicago, Illinois. With respect to Product or Service revenues, [***], or
[***] that are used in the calculation of Ibis Net Sales and are in monies
other than United States dollars, the amount to be used will first be
determined in the foreign currency of the country for such monies and then
converted into equivalent United States funds using the same conversion
methodology that Abbott uses to prepare its financial statements filed with
the SEC.

  

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Sections 2.3(a)_ through _2.3(c)_ ,
(i) the earnout amounts described in _Sections 2.3(a)_ and _2.3(b)_
will be payable only on cumulative Ibis Net Sales in excess of the
Earnout Threshold, (ii) no such earnout amounts will be payable in any
calendar year in which total Ibis Net Sales in such calendar year were less
than or equal to [***], (iii) in any calendar year in which Ibis Net Sales
exceed [***] and cumulative Ibis Net Sales exceed the Earnout Threshold, the
earnout amounts described in _Sections 2.3(a)_ and _2.3(b)_ will
be payable with respect to all Ibis Net Sales in such calendar year which are
in excess of the Earnout Threshold and (iv) all Ibis Net Sales, regardless
of whether earnout amounts are payable thereon, will be included in
cumulative Ibis Net Sales for purposes of determining the applicable Earnout
Rate. For example, if Ibis Net Sales in each of the calendar years 1 and 3
are equal to [***] and Ibis Net Sales in each of the calendar years 2 and 4
are equal to [***], no earnout amounts would be payable in calendar years 1
through 3, but earnout amounts would be payable with respect to the entire
[***] in Ibis Net Sales in calendar year 4. The earnout amounts payable by
Ibis to Isis pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ are referred to herein as the "
_Earnout Payments_."

  

### 

  

### (f) Ibis shall maintain its books and records used to determine Ibis Net
Sales, [***], and [***] for a period of three (3) years from the date of the
Earnout Payment to which they pertain. Ibis shall make such books and
records available for inspection by third party representatives of
Isis approved in writing (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) once per calendar year at reasonable times
and upon reasonable written advance notice from Isis.  All information
contained in these books and records shall be Confidential Information and
will be used only for the purpose of determining the accuracy of Ibis
calculation of any Earnout Payment.

  

### 

  

### (g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document to the contrary, except with respect to any [***]
arising as a result of or in connection with a breach of the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 5.1(l)(v)_, the Earnout Payment
reductions set forth in _Sections 2.3(a)_ and _2.3(b)_ will be the AMI
Groups sole and exclusive remedy for any [***].

  

### 

  

2.4 [ _Reserved_ ]

  



        
   

  



  

2.5 _Restricted Assets_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to assign or transfer any interest in any Contract, asset, claim, right or
benefit the assignment or transfer of which is otherwise contemplated by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent such assignment or
transfer (or attempt to make such an assignment or transfer) without the
consent or approval of a third party would constitute a breach or other
contravention of the rights of such third party, or affect adversely
the rights of any Party or their Affiliates thereunder (such assets
being collectively referred to herein as " _Restricted Assets_ "). Any
assignment or transfer of a Restricted Asset shall be made subject to such
consent or approval being obtained. If any such consent or approval is
not obtained prior to the Closing, (a) the assigning or transferring Party
shall continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the other Party in attempting to obtain any such consent or approval and (b)
establish alternative arrangements (such as a license, sublease, subcontract
or operating agreement) until such time as such consent or approval has been
obtained which results in the assignee or transferee Party receiving all the
benefits and bearing all the burdens with respect to any such Restricted
Asset (subject to _Section 8.4_ , pursuant to which Isis shall be liable for
and pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with obtaining third
party consents associated with any Ibis Contract or Restricted Asset in
excess of [***] in the aggregate).

Party proper notice pursuant to _Section 10.6_ prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival period shall survive such expiration until such
claims are resolved by written agreement of the Parties or by order of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

(viii) [***] claims from [***] related to goods and services provided to

_Exhibit C_ to the extent such [***] claims are in excess of the [***].

  



  

### (b) With respect to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Sections
8.2(a)(i)_, _8.2(a)(iii)_ or  _8.2(a)(iv)_ above, Isis will be liable to
the AMI Group for any such Losses only if the aggregate amount of all such

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the recovery limitations set forth in this

  

### 

  

### 44   

     
   

  



  

### _Section 8.2(d)_ shall not apply to any Losses suffered as a result of
the breach by AMI of any [***].

  

### 

  

### (e) If any third party shall notify any Party to this Agreement (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") of any matter which may give rise to a claim (a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") for indemnification against any other Party to this
Agreement (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this _Section 8.2_, then the
following procedures shall apply:

  

### 

  

(i) The Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party thereof;
_provided_ , that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent such failure shall have actually materially prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(ii) If the Third Party Claim pertains to any matter other than those
identified in Sections _8.2(a)(vi)_ or _8.2(a)(vii)_ , once the
Indemnified Party has given notice of the matter to the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnified Party shall defend against the matter in any manner it
reasonably may deem appropriate. The Indemnifying Party may, at its sole
cost and expense, participate in the defense of such Claim with co-counsel of
its choice. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
participate in such defense if the claim in which the Indemnifying Party
seeks to participate (A) seeks non-monetary relief that does not seek to
obtain a license or other access to, restrict the scope of, or adversely
affect the enforceability of, any Intellectual Property controlled by the
Indemnifying Party, (B) seeks injunctive relief, (C) involves criminal
allegations against an Indemnified Party or (D) is one in which the
Indemnifying Party is also a party and joint representation would
be inappropriate or there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified
Party which are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to the matter or enter into any settlement with
respect to the matter without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(iii) If the Third Party Claim pertains to any matter identified in Sections
_8.2(a)(vi)_ or  _8.2(a)(vii)_ , in connection with the prosecution, defense
and resolution of such matter, as among Isis and the members of the AMI
Group, once a member of the AMI Group has given notice of the matter to Isis,
Isis shall control the prosecution, defense and resolution of such matter as
it may reasonably deem appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision in this Agreement to the contrary (A) the AMI Group will have
the right to participate, at its own expense, in the prosecution, defense or
resolution of such Third Party Claim to the extent such Third Party Claim (1)
seeks injunctive relief against a member of the AMI Group, (2) involves
criminal allegations against a member of the AMI Group or (3) is one in which
Isis is also a party and joint representation would be inappropriate or there
may be legal defenses available to a member of the AMI Group which are
different from or additional to those available to Isis (such Third Party
Claims, to the extent meeting the criteria set forth in subsections
(e)(iii)(A)(1), (e)(iii)(A)(2) or (e)(iii)(A)(3) above are referred to as "
_Special AMI Claims_ "), (B) Isis shall not consent to the entry of any
judgment with

  



        
   

  



  

respect to any matter identified in Sections _8.2(a)(vi)_ or  _8.2(a)(vii)_
or enter into any settlement with respect to such matter without AMIs prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
(C) the AMI Group shall not consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to any Special AMI Claims or enter into any settlement with respect to such
Special AMI Claims without Isis prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (D) for any matter that
Isis is entitled to control pursuant to this _Section 8.2(e)(iii)_, Isis
shall promptly advise in-house counsel designated by AMI of all court filings
as well as developments with respect to such matter.

  



  

### (f) None of the AMI Group or the Seller Group shall be entitled to
recover any Losses relating to any matter arising under one provision of this
Agreement to the extent that any such Person has already recovered Losses
with respect to such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement
(including but not limited to the earnout payment reductions provided under
_Sections 2.3(a)_ and _2.3(b)_ ) or the Master Agreement, it being
understood and agreed that application of the foregoing provision shall not
preclude the AMI Group from recovering any Losses incurred by the AMI Group
in connection with the operation of the Business or the exploitation of the
Business IP that are not [***].

  

### 

  

### (g) In determining (i) whether any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein has been breached or (ii) the amount of any Loss
with respect thereto, any materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or similar
qualification contained therein shall be disregarded.

  

### 

  

### (h) Indemnification for each Loss for which an Indemnifying Party, but
for this _Section 8.2(h)_, would be liable under _Section 8.2(a)_ or
_Section 8.2(c)_ shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds
actually paid to any member of the AMI Group or the Seller Group, as the case
may be, by any unaffiliated third party with respect to such Loss, in each
case net of any Losses incurred by any member of the AMI Group or the Seller
Group as the case may be in collecting such proceeds or payments; _provided_
 that this _Section 8.2(h)_ shall not limit in any respect the right of any
member of the AMI Group or the Seller Group, as the case may be, to pursue
indemnification from an Indemnifying Party hereunder or from recovering for
any Loss not reduced to zero pursuant to this _Section 8.2(h)_. Nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to cause any amounts for which a member of
the AMI Group or the Seller Group, as the case may be, would ultimately be
responsible, as a result of deductibles, self-insurance, indemnification of
insurers, caps or similar items or arrangements, to not be subject to
indemnification as "Losses" hereunder.

  

### 

  

### (i) For Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat all payments made under
this _Section 8.2_ as adjustments to the Purchase Price, except to the
extent any applicable Tax Law does not permit such treatment. If any
Governmental Authority disputes treatment as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, the Party receiving notice of such dispute will promptly notify and
consult the other Party concerning resolution of such dispute.

  



  

8.3 _Press Release and Announcements_. On the date hereof, the Parties may
issue a press release announcing the execution of this Agreement,
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G. Each Party agrees not
to issue any other press release or other

  



        
   

  



  

public statement relating to or make any public filing with respect to the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each Party agrees to provide to the
other Party a copy of any public announcement or public filing regarding the
Transaction Documents or the subject matter thereof as far in advance as
practicable under the circumstances prior to its scheduled release. Except
under extraordinary circumstances, each Party will provide the other with an
advance copy of any such announcement at least [***] prior to its scheduled
release. The contents of any announcement or filing or similar publicity
which has been reviewed, approved and released by the reviewing Party may be
re-released by either Party without a requirement for advance notice or re-
approval.

  



  

8.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of AMI and Isis
will bear its own costs and expenses (including, without limitation, all
legal, accounting, consulting, investment banking, brokerage and other
fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided that all costs and expenses
associated with obtaining third party consents with respect to Ibis Contracts
or any Restricted Asset less than or equal to [***] in the aggregate shall be
borne by AMI and that, in accordance with _Section 2.5_ , all such costs and
expenses in excess of [***] in the aggregate shall be borne by Isis; provided
further, that the initial premerger notification and filing fee for HSR shall
be borne by AMI, but any fees arising from any subsequent filings with
respect thereto shall be borne equally by AMI and Isis.

  



  

8.5 _Setoff_. AMI and Ibis shall have the right to set off any claim AMI or
Ibis may have against Isis under this Agreement or the Transition Services
Agreement against any amounts owing to Isis under this Agreement; provided
that (i) AMI provides written notice to Isis of such setoff claim and (ii)
initiates the ADR process described in _Exhibit H_  hereto. AMI shall setoff
any amounts pursuant to the foregoing by [***]

  



  

8.6 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

### (a) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration and
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties, interest and filing expenses)
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by Isis, and Isis
will prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, the Parties
will, and will cause their Affiliates to, cooperate in the execution of such
Tax Returns. If AMI or one of its Affiliates is required to execute any Tax
Return prepared by Isis under this section, Isis will provide a copy of such
Tax Return to AMI at least 10 days prior to the anticipated filing of such
Tax Return and AMI or its Affiliate shall execute the Tax Return, subject to
Abbotts reasonable approval.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Ad Valorem Taxes_. All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes,
ad valorem obligations and similar Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, in each
case levied on Ibis, other than transfer Taxes provided for in _Section
8.6(a)_ above, for a taxable period which includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date shall be apportioned between Isis and AMI as of the Closing Date
based on the number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-
Closing Tax period and the number of days of such taxable period included in
the Post-Closing period. Isis shall be liable for the proportionate amount
of such Taxes that is attributable to the

  



  

### 47   

     
   

  



  

### Pre-Closing Tax period. Within 90 days after the Closing, Isis and AMI
shall present a reimbursement to which each is entitled under this _Section
8.6(b)_ together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the proration amount; _provided_ , that if the final Tax amount
due for a taxable period that includes the Closing Date is not determined
within such period, a reimbursement shall be based on the amount of the
relevant Tax for the preceding taxable year, subject to an adjustment within
30 days after the final amount of such Tax is determined. The proration amount
shall be paid by the Party owing it to the other within 10 days after
delivery of such statement. Thereafter, Isis shall notify AMI upon receipt
of any bill for real or personal property Taxes relating to Ibis, part or all
of which are attributable to the Post-Closing Tax period, and shall promptly
deliver such bill to AMI who shall pay the same to the appropriate taxing
authority, _provided_ , that if such bill covers any portion of the Pre-
Closing Tax period, Isis shall also remit prior to the due date of assessment
to AMI payment for the proportionate amount of such bill that is attributable
to the Pre-Closing Tax period. In the event that either Isis or AMI shall
thereafter make a payment for which it is entitled to reimbursement under
this _Section 8.6(b)_, the other Party shall make such reimbursement
promptly but in no event later than 30 days after the presentation of a
statement setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the presenting
Party is entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably
necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement. Any payment required under
this _Section 8.6(b)_ and not made within 10 days of delivery of the
statement shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate for each day until paid.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Tax Liability_.

  

### 

  

(i) Isis shall, in accordance with _Section 8.2(a)_ (except as
explicitly provided in this _Section 8.6_), indemnify and hold harmless the
AMI Group from any and all Losses arising from: (1) all Taxes (or the non-
payment thereof) of Ibis for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, (2) all Taxes of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which
Ibis (or any predecessor thereof) is or was a member on or prior to
the Closing Date, including pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or
any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign Law, and (3) any and
all Taxes of any Person (other than Ibis) imposed on Ibis as a transferee
or successor, by contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing.

  



  

(ii) To the extent there is any taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes
based on or measured by income or receipts of Ibis for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable
period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which Ibis holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount
of other Taxes of Ibis for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

  



        
   

  



  

(iii) AMI shall, in accordance with _Section 8.2(c)_ (except as
explicitly provided in this _Section 8.6_), indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller Group from any and all Losses arising from: (1) all Taxes (or
the non-payment thereof) of Ibis for the Post-Closing Tax Period, (2)
all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which Ibis (or any successor thereto) is a member after the Closing
Date, including pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local, or foreign Law, and (3) any and all Taxes
of any Person (other than Ibis) imposed on Ibis as a transferee or successor,
by contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring after the Closing.

  



  

(iv) Isis and AMIs obligations to indemnify for any Taxes under this
_Section 8.6_ shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue until 30 days
following the expiration of the statute of limitations on assessment of the
relevant Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for indemnification
shall survive such termination date if the Indemnified Party, prior to such
termination date, shall have advised the Indemnifying Party in writing of
facts that constitute or may give rise to an alleged claim for
indemnification under this _Section 8.6_.

  



  

### (d) _Tax Returns_.

  

### 

  

(i) Isis shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account any
extensions received from the relevant Tax authorities) (1) all Tax Returns
that are required to be filed with respect to Ibis on or before the Closing
Date, and (2) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date with respect to income Taxes of Ibis with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, and shall pay when due (X) any income Taxes due in respect of such
Tax Returns, and (Y) any other Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns that
are due on or before the Closing Date.

  



  

### (e) _Contest Provisions_.

  

### 

  

(i) Isis shall have the sole right to control the conduct and resolution of
any audit, litigation, contest, dispute, negotiation, or other proceeding
with any Tax authority that relates to income Taxes of Ibis relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, including, without limitation, by selecting counsel
of its choice to represent Ibis, unless Isis fails to assert such control
within 30 days of receiving notice of such proceeding (each such proceeding
for which Isis asserts such control, an " _Isis Proceeding_ "); _provided_ ,
that (A) Isis shall consult with AMI and keep AMI informed regarding the
progress and any potential compromise or settlement of each Isis Proceeding;
and (B) AMI shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in each Isis
Proceeding and (C) Isis shall not settle or otherwise compromise any Isis
Proceeding without the consent of AMI to the extent such settlement or
compromise would have an adverse effect on AMI or Ibis with respect to a
Post-Closing Tax Period, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(ii) AMI shall have the sole right to control the conduct and resolution of
any audit, litigation, contest, dispute, negotiation, or other proceeding
with

  



        
   

  



  

any Tax authority relating to Taxes of Ibis that is not an Isis Proceeding,
including, without limitation, by selecting counsel of its choice to
represent Ibis (each such proceeding, an " _AMI Proceeding_ ");  _provided_ ,
that (A) AMI shall consult with Isis regarding the progress and any potential
compromise or settlement of any Isis Proceeding that relates to Taxes for
which Isis may be liable pursuant to _Section 8.6(c)(i)_ of this Agreement
(an " _Applicable AMI Proceeding_ "); (B) Isis shall be entitled to
participate at its own expense in any Applicable AMI Proceeding; and (C) AMI
shall not settle or otherwise compromise any Applicable AMI Proceeding
without the consent of Isis to the extent such settlement or compromise would
have an adverse effect on Isis or Ibis with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  



  

(iii) Provided AMI fails to assert control over an Applicable AMI Proceeding
within 30 days of receiving notice of such proceeding, Isis shall have the
sole right to control the conduct and resolution of an Applicable AMI
Proceeding with any Tax authority, including, without limitation, by
selecting counsel of its choice to represent Ibis; _provided_ , that (A) Isis
shall promptly consult with AMI regarding the progress and any potential
compromise or settlement of any Applicable AMI Proceeding; (B) AMI shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in any Applicable Isis Proceeding;
and (C) neither Isis nor Ibis shall settle or compromise any Applicable AMI
Proceeding without the prior written consent of AMI, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

### (f) _Assistance and Cooperation_. From and after the Closing Date, each
of Isis and AMI shall:

  

### 

  

(i) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist) the other party
in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for
preparing and filing in accordance with this _Section 8.6_;

  



  

(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audit, litigation, contest,
dispute, negotiation, or other proceeding with any Tax authority regarding
Taxes of Ibis;

  



  

(iii) make available to the other party and to any Tax authority, as

Proceeding.

  



  

### (g) _Code § 338(h)(10) Election_. At AMIs option, Isis and AMI shall
join in making an election under Code § 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding
elections under state, local, or foreign tax law) (collectively a " _§
338(h)(10) Election_") with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares,
the Additional Shares and the Remaining Shares, unless and to the extent

  

### 

  

### 50   

     
   

  



  

### the Code is amended to prevent or limit the filing of a § 338(h)(10)
Election. Isis will pay any Tax attributable to the making of the §
338(h)(10) Election and will indemnify the AMI Group against any Losses
arising out of any failure to pay such Tax.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Parties agree that the Purchase
Price and the liabilities of Ibis (and other relevant items) will be
allocated for tax purposes to the assets of Ibis in a manner consistent with
Code §§ 338 and 1060 and the regulations thereunder. AMI, Ibis and Isis
shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund)
and information reports in a manner consistent with such allocation.

  

### 

  

8.7 _Further Assurances_. Isis will execute and deliver such further
instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such additional action as AMI
may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm or evidence the
transfer to AMI of the Remaining Shares and the assets of the Business
(including the Business IP and the Ibis Contracts), and Isis will execute
such documents as may be necessary to assist AMI in preserving or perfecting
its rights in the Shares, the Remaining Shares and the Business. Except for
the services, funding and facilities provided under the Corporate Services
Agreement, to the extent any assets used in the Business on or prior to the
Closing Date (including the Business IP and the Ibis Contracts) or necessary
to conduct the Business as conducted on and prior to the Closing Date
(including the Business IP and the Ibis Contracts) or as contemplated to be
conducted after the Closing Date have not been duly and fully transferred to
Ibis as of such date, Isis hereby covenants, at its sole cost and expense and
without further consideration by AMI, to take all such actions as may be
requested by AMI to promptly transfer such assets to Ibis or AMIs designee.

  



  

8.8 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

### (a) Each Party agrees that for a period of three (3) years after the
Closing Date, a Party (the " _Receiving Party_ ") receiving or that has
received Confidential Information of the other Party (the " _Disclosing
Party_ ") will (i) maintain and cause its Representatives to maintain in
confidence such Confidential Information using not less than the efforts such
Receiving Party uses to maintain in confidence other proprietary information
of similar kind and value (it being understood and agreed that AMI shall have
no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any Ibis Confidential
Information and that Isis shall have an obligation to maintain the
confidentiality of all Ibis Confidential Information pursuant to this
_Section 8.8_), (ii) not disclose such Confidential Information except to
the Receiving Partys employees or Affiliates having a need-to-know such
Confidential Information solely for purposes of performing the Receiving
Partys obligations under the Transaction Documents, (iii) not disclose such
Confidential Information to any Person without the prior written consent of
the Disclosing Party, except for disclosures expressly permitted by the
Transaction Documents, and (iv) not use such Confidential Information for any
purpose except those expressly permitted by the Transaction Documents. The
provisions of this _Section 8.8_ shall supersede the provisions of Section
5.1, Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 of the Master Agreement which shall
terminate and be of no further force or effect from and after the Closing
Date. Upon AMIs request Isis will return or destroy (and certify to AMI any
such destruction) all Confidential Information of AMI or its Affiliates and
upon Isis request, AMI will return or destroy (and certify to Isis any such
destruction) all Confidential Information of Isis that is not Confidential
Information of Ibis;

  

### 

  

### 51   

     
   

  



  

### _provided_ , that AMI may retain one (1) copy of Isis Confidential
Information in Abbotts confidential files.

  

### 

  

### (b) To the extent (and only to the extent) that it is reasonably
necessary, a Party may disclose Confidential Information belonging to the
other Party in the following instances:

  

### 

  

(i) when defending litigation related to the Confidential Information to be
disclosed;

  



  

(ii) when complying with Applicable Laws (including, without limitation, the
rules and regulations of the SEC or any national securities exchange, and
compliance with Tax Laws) and with judicial process; and

  



  

(iii) disclosure, in connection with the performance of the Transaction
Documents and solely on a need-to-know basis, to employees or independent
contractors (including without limitation consultants and clinical
investigators), each of whom prior to disclosure must be bound by written
obligations of confidentiality and non-use no less restrictive than the
obligations set forth in this _Section 8.8_;  _provided_ , that the
Receiving Party will remain responsible for any failure by any Person who
receives Confidential Information pursuant to this _Section 8.8_ to treat
such Confidential Information as required under this _Section 8.8_.

  



  

### (c) If and whenever any Confidential Information is disclosed in
accordance with this _Section 8.8_, such disclosure will not cause any such
information to cease to be Confidential Information except to the extent that
such permitted disclosure results in a public disclosure of such information
(other than by breach of this Agreement). Except as prohibited by Law, the
Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party of the Receiving Partys
intent to make such disclosure pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of _Section
8.8(b)_ sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the
Disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the Disclosing Party
may deem appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the information.  In
addition, in the event any Party proposes to file with any
Governmental Authority a Transaction Document, including, without limitation,
as an exhibit to a registration statement, periodic report, or current
report, the Party proposing to make such filing will notify the other Parties
of such intention and will work in good faith with the other Parties to
obtain confidential treatment of any material terms of the Transaction
Documents that such other Parties request be kept confidential (except to the
extent advised by counsel or such Governmental Authority that confidential
treatment is not available for such information).

  

### 

  

### (d) At the Closing, Isis shall deliver to AMI all Confidential
Information of the Business in Isis or its Affiliates possession and
control and all copies thereof, in whatever form or medium, including,
without limitation, written records, optical and magnetic media, and all
other materials containing any such Confidential Information. If AMI
requests, Isis shall promptly provide written confirmation that all such
materials have been delivered to AMI.

  

### 

  

### 52   

     
   

  

### 

  

### (e) The existence and the terms and conditions of the Transaction
Documents that the Parties have not specifically agreed to disclose pursuant
to _Section 8.8(b)_ or _Section 8.3_ will be considered Confidential
Information of both Parties. AMI and, subject to the terms of _Section
7.8_, Isis may disclose such terms to a bona fide potential investor,
investment banker, acquirer, merger partner or other potential business
partner of AMI or Isis, respectively, and their attorneys and agents,

Management Presentations (a " _Pre-Existing Business_ "), then the provisions
of _Section 8.9(a)_ will not apply to such Pre-Existing Business if (i) such

Affiliates to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of Abbott and Ibis
Confidential Information.

  

### 

  

### (c) _No Solicitation of AMI Employees_. During the period from the date
hereof to and including the [***] anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Nonsolicitation Period_ "), Isis (and until the Closing, Ibis) shall not and
shall not permit any of their respective Representatives to directly
or indirectly, (i) without the prior written consent of AMI, induce
or attempt to induce any employee of AMI or any member of the Abbott

relationship between Isis or Ibis and any of their respective employees, or
Known consultant or independent contractor thereof or (ii) without the prior
written consent of Isis or Ibis (as the case may be), hire directly or
through another entity any employee of Isis or Ibis or any Person who was an
employee of Isis or Ibis who was employed by Isis or Ibis during the [***]

### 

  

### (e) _No Solicitation of Ibis Employees_. During the Nonsolicitation
Period, Isis shall not and shall not permit any of its Representatives to

or attempt to induce any employee of Ibis to leave the employ of Ibis, or in
any way interfere with the relationship between Ibis and any employee,

of their respective Affiliates or the Business, to cease doing business with
Ibis, AMI or any of their respective Affiliates or the Business.

  

### 

  

For purposes of _Sections 8.9(c)_ , _8.9(d)_ and  _8.9(e)_ , "recruit,"
"solicit" or "induce" shall not be deemed to mean (i) circumstances where an
employee, consultant or independent contractor or former employee, consultant
or independent contractor initiates contact with a Party with regard to
possible employment, or (ii) general solicitations of employment
not specifically targeted at specific employees of a Party, including
responses to general advertisements.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.9_ to the contrary, if at any
time a court holds that the restrictions stated in _Section 8.9(a)_, 
_Section 8.9(c)_, _Section 8.9(d)_ or _Section 8.9(e)_ or any part of any
of the foregoing are unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable under
circumstances then existing, the Parties hereto agree that the
maximum period, scope or geographical area determined to be reasonable under
such circumstances by such court will be substituted for the stated period,
scope or area. The Parties acknowledge and agree that money damages may not
be an adequate remedy for any breach or threatened breach of the provisions
of _Section 8.9(a)_, _Section 8.9(c)_,  _Section 8.9(d)_ or _Section
8.9(e)_ and that, in such event, any Party or its successors or assigns may,
in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its or their favor,
apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance,
injunctive and/or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations
of the provisions of this _Section 8.9_ (including, if the court so
determines, the extension of the Noncompete Period or the Nonsolicitation
Period, as applicable, by a period equal to the length of court proceedings
necessary to stop such violation). Any injunction shall be available without
the posting of any bond or other security.  In the event of an alleged
breach or violation by any Party or any of their respective Representatives
of any of

  



        
   

  



  

the provisions of this _Section 8.9_, the Noncompete Period or the
Nonsolicitation Period, as applicable will be tolled until such alleged
breach or violation is resolved. The Parties agree that the
restrictions contained in this _Section 8.9_ are reasonable in all respects.

  



  

8.10 _Access to Books and Records_. After the Closing, Isis will permit AMI
and its representatives, and AMI will permit Isis and its representatives, to
have reasonable access upon prior notice and at reasonable times, and in a
manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations of the
other Party, to all books, records (including Tax records), contracts and
documents of or pertaining to Ibis.

  



  

8.11 _Employee and Related Matters_.

  



  

### (a) _Ibis Employees_. All employees of Ibis employed as of the Closing
Date (the " _Ibis Employees_ ") shall, as of the Closing, receive
compensation and benefits from Abbott that are substantially comparable, in
the aggregate, to the compensation and benefits received by other similarly-
situated employees of Abbott based on Abbotts evaluation of the nature and
scope of such employees duties, principal location where those duties are
performed, grade level and performance. To facilitate Abbotts obligations
to provide such compensation and benefits under this _Section 8.11_, Isis
shall provide AMI promptly, upon AMIs request, but in any event, no
less than [***] prior to the Closing Date (and again on the Closing Date) a
true, complete and accurate list of each Ibis Employee, including the date
of employment and title or job position of each Ibis Employee,
information regarding pay and benefits, including, but not limited to, the
total annual salary, wages, bonus or other compensation of each Ibis
Employee, and, with respect to any Ibis Employees who are inactive Ibis
Employees (as defined in _Section 8.11(f)_), the date such inactive employee
changed from active to inactive status, the reason for such inactive status
and, if applicable, the anticipated date of return to active employment.
Ibis Employees shall be employees at will, subject to Abbotts employment
policies and nothing herein shall be construed to limit Abbotts ability to
(a) terminate or alter the employment terms of any Ibis Employee for any
reason, including without cause, or (b) modify, amend or terminate any
employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement.

  

### 

  

### (b) _WARN_. Isis covenants and agrees to cause Ibis to comply, if
applicable, with all requirements specified under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the " _WARN Act_ ") or any similar or
successor federal, state or local law, including the provision of appropriate
notice to affected employees with respect to any "employment loss" (as
defined in the WARN Act) that occurs on or prior to the Closing Date. Except
as set forth on _Schedule 8.11(b)_ , no Ibis Employee has suffered an
"employment loss" during the ninety (90)-day period prior to the date hereof.
Isis shall update _Schedule 8.11(b)_ as necessary to reflect all "employment
losses" between the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (c) _COBRA_. Isis shall retain responsibility for all liability for any
health care continuation coverage or notice requirement under Section 4980B
of the Code and Part G of Subtitle B of Title 1 of ERISA with respect to any
Plan, including with respect to all former employees of Ibis or the Business,
who are former employees thereof as of the Closing.

  



         
 

  



  

### (d) _Retirement Plans_. Prior to or on the Closing Date, Isis and/or Ibis
shall make all matching contributions and a pro-rated portion of any profit
sharing contributions that would otherwise be made for the plan year (without
regard to any year-end employment requirements) with respect to the Ibis
Employees contributions to any Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Isis Retirement Plans_ "). Isis shall prior
to the Closing: (A) amend each Isis Retirement Plan to cause the account
balances or accrued benefits of Ibis Employees to be fully vested as of the
Closing Date and (B) amend each Isis Retirement Plan that includes a cash or
deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code to permit Ibis
Employees with an outstanding plan loan to roll over such loan to Abbotts
401(k) plan.  Abbott will cause its 401(k) plan to accept a direct rollover
of the Ibis Employees 401(k) account balance, including a direct rollover
of any outstanding plan loan.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Payroll Tax Reporting_. Ibis, Isis and AMI agree that
payroll reporting of the Ibis Employees will be treated in accordance with
the Alternate Procedure set forth in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Retention of Liability_. Isis shall be solely responsible for, and
retain all liabilities with respect to and Isis shall retain, bear and
discharge all liabilities and obligations with respect to (i) all inactive
Ibis Employees until such time as the inactive Ibis Employee returns to

commissions, bonuses, vacation pay and other compensation payable to any Ibis
Employee for all periods through and including the Closing Date. AMI shall
not assume liability for any retention, severance, change-of-control or
similar agreements between Isis and any of the Ibis Employees, and Isis shall
retain or assume liability for all obligations under any such retention,
severance, change-of-control or similar agreements. For purposes of this

Ibis shall cause the number of full-time equivalent employees (not
including temporary employees and consultants) of Ibis to be not greater than
70 in the aggregate and to be not less than 56 in the aggregate.

  

### 

  

### (h) _No Third Party Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, shall create a contract of employment with any Ibis Employee or

employee benefit plan of AMI or Ibis or confer any benefit, entitlement, or
right upon any person or entity other than the parties hereto or result in
AMI or Ibis having any liability under any Plan.

Ibis receives for the payment of [***]. Following the Closing, Ibis shall
collect such [***] using commercially reasonably efforts, taking into account
the manner in which Ibis collected similar receivables prior to the Closing
Date. For Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat all payments made under
this Section 8.14 as adjustments to the Purchase Price, except to the extent
any applicable Tax Law does not permit such treatment. If any Governmental
Authority disputes treatment as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, the

other Party concerning resolution of such dispute.

10.13 _Remedies_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other
Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached.  Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that,
subject to _Section 10.8_ the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in
any action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter (subject to _Section
10.8_ above), in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled,
at law or in equity.

  



  

10.14 _Severability._ In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that

  



        
   

  



  

will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and
other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  



  

10.15 _No Other Compensation._

  



  

The Parties hereby agree that the terms of the Transaction Documents fully
define all consideration, compensation and benefits, monetary or otherwise,
to be paid, granted or delivered by Isis or Ibis to AMI or Abbott and by AMI
or Abbott to Isis or Ibis in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein and therein. No Party previously has paid or entered into any other
commitment to pay, whether orally or in writing, any employee of any
other Party, directly or indirectly, any consideration, compensation or
benefits, monetary or otherwise, in connection with the transactions
contemplated in the Transaction Documents.

 **TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT**

  

 ** **

  

THIS TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of this [ ]
day of **[** **]** , 2009, by and between Ibis
Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Ibis_ "), and Isis
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Isis_ ").  Ibis and Isis
are sometimes referred to herein individually as a " _Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_."

  



  

WHEREAS, Ibis, Isis and Abbott Molecular Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _AMI_
"), have entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of December
17, 2008 **** (the " _Acquisition Agreement_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, among other things, AMI has
acquired the Remaining Shares of Capital Stock of Ibis such that, as of
the date hereof, Ibis is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMI;

  



  

WHEREAS, to facilitate an orderly transition of the Business, Isis has agreed
to provide certain transition services to Ibis, as set forth herein; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Ibis has agreed to cooperate with and offer support to Isis
in connection with closing the books of Ibis as they relate to the operation
of the Business prior to the Closing, as set forth herein.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, representations,
warranties, and covenants hereinafter set forth and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

 **Section 1. _Definitions_**.

  



  

Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Acquisition Agreement. In addition to
the terms defined elsewhere herein and in the Acquisition Agreement, the
following terms when used in this Agreement shall have the following
meanings:

  



  

" _Acquisition Agreement_ " has the meaning set forth in the Recitals.

  



  

" _AMI_ " has the meaning set forth in the Recitals.

  



  

" _Additional Services_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section 2(b)_.

  



  

" _Agreement_ " means this Transition Services Agreement, including all
Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto, as it may be amended from time
to time pursuant to the provisions hereof.

  



  

" _Fees_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section 2(f)_.

  



  

" _Ibis_ " has the meaning set forth in the Preamble.

  



        
   

  



  

" _Initial Services_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section 2(a)_.

  



  

" _Isis_ " has the meaning set forth in the Preamble.

  



  

" _Schedule of Services_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section 2(a)_.

  



  

" _Services_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section 2(b)_.

  



  

" _Term_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section 4(a)_.

  



  

" _Third Party_ " means any Person other than Isis, Ibis and any of their
respective Affiliates.

  



  

 **Section 2. _Services_**.

  



  

(a) _Initial Services_. Commencing on the Closing Date, Isis shall provide
to Ibis the applicable services (the " _Initial Services_ ") set forth on the
Schedule of Services attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Schedule of
Services_ ").

  



  

(b) _Additional Services_. At any time during the Term, Ibis may request in
writing that Isis provide other services to Ibis hereunder. If Isis consents
in writing to such request, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
if such requested service has been provided by Isis to the Business during
the 12-month period ending on the Closing Date, then the Schedule of Services
shall be amended to add such services (the " _Additional Services_ " and,
together with the Initial Services, the " _Services_ "). Each Schedule
describing an Additional Service shall set forth a description of such
Additional Service, the time period during which such Additional Service will
be provided, the charges for such Additional Service and any other terms
applicable thereto.

  



  

(c) _Audit Assistance_. Each of the Parties and their respective Affiliates
are or may be subject to regulation and audit by Governmental Authorities,
standards organizations, customers or other Parties to contracts with such
Parties under Applicable Law and contract provisions. If a Governmental
Authority, standards organization, or customer or other party to a contract
with a Party or an Affiliate of a Party exercises its right to examine or
audit such Partys or its Affiliates books, records, documents or accounting
practices and procedures pursuant to such Applicable Law, standards or
contract provisions and such audit or examination relates to the Services or
the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing, the other Party shall
provide (at its own expense), all reasonable assistance requested by the
Party that is subject to the audit in responding to such audits or requests
for information, to the extent that such assistance or information is within
the reasonable control of the cooperating Party and is related to the
Services or the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing.  Specifically,
Ibis accounting group and contract administration group will assist Isis in
all activities related to Ibis work performed under its government contracts
prior to the Closing.  These activities include (i) preparing and sending
invoices related to 2008 activity, (ii) preparing and filing on or prior to
June 30, 2009 the 2008 incurred cost submission, (iii) planning, preparing
for and executing the 2008 project-specific audit (A-133 audit) so that the
audit report is filed on or prior to September 30, 2009, (iv)
contract closeout audits, (v) incurred cost submission audits and (vi)
any other contract audits pertaining to work Ibis performed prior to the
Closing. Additionally, Ibis accounting

  



        
   

  



  

group and contract administration group will make available to Isis any
documentation related to government contracts, government billings, indirect
rate calculations or any other documents related to government contracts
under which Ibis performed work prior to the Closing that Isis reasonably
requests in writing.  Ibis shall perform such services using due care and in
a commercially reasonable manner that is substantially similar in nature,
quality and timeliness to the same tasks performed by Ibis prior to the
Closing Date. All information provided pursuant to this _Section 2(c)_
shall be subject to Section 8.8 of the Acquisition Agreement
(Confidentiality).

  



  

(d) _Accounting and IT Services_. For [***] to Isis, Ibis will provide Isis
with the accounting and information technology services set forth in _Exhibit
B_ until the termination date set forth in _Exhibit B_ for each such
service.

  



  

(e) _Access_. Subject to Section 8.8 of the Acquisition Agreement
(Confidentiality), Ibis shall make available on a timely basis to Isis all
information and materials reasonably requested by Isis that are necessary to
enable Isis to provide the relevant Services.

  



  

(f) _Performance of Services_. Except as specifically set forth in the
applicable Schedule of Services, Isis shall perform all Services using due
care and in a commercially reasonable manner that is substantially similar in
nature, quality and timeliness to analogous services provided to Ibis prior
to the Closing Date.

  



  

(g) _Charges for Services_. Subject to adjustment in accordance with Section
8.16 of the Acquisition Agreement (Fees for Transition Services), the
aggregate charges for all Initial Services shall be [***] (the " _Fees_ "),
which shall be payable in equal monthly installments. The charges for
an Additional Service, if any, shall be described in detail on the Schedule
of Services with respect to such Additional Service. Ibis will pay the
applicable charges for the Services in accordance with _Section 3_ (Billing;
Taxes).

  



  

(h) _Transitional Nature of Services_. The Parties acknowledge the
transitional nature of the Services and agree to cooperate in good faith and
to use reasonable best efforts to effectuate a smooth transition of the
Services from Isis to Ibis (or its Affiliates).

  



  

(i) _Cooperation_. In the event that (i) there is nonperformance of any
Service as a result of an event described in _Section 7(c)_ (Force Majeure),
or (ii) the provision of a Service would violate Applicable Law, the Parties
agree to work together in good faith to arrange for an alternative means by
which Ibis may obtain, at Ibis sole cost, the Services so affected.

  



  

(j) _Use of Third Parties to Provide Services_.  Isis may perform its
obligations through its Affiliates or, if prior to the Closing, Isis obtains
analogous services for itself from agents, subcontractors or independent
contractors, Isis may perform its obligations hereunder through the use of
agents, subcontractors or independent contractors. If, prior to the
Closing, Isis is not obtaining analogous services for itself from agents,
subcontractors or independent contractors, Isis may perform its obligations
hereunder through the use of agents, subcontractors or independent
contractors only upon obtaining the prior written consent of Ibis, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Isis shall not be relieved of its obligations under this Agreement
by use of such Affiliates, agents, subcontractors or contractors.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 3. _Billing; Taxes_**.

  



  

(a) _Procedure_. For the Initial Services, Isis shall invoice Ibis monthly
for the prior months pro rata share of the Fees. Unless otherwise mutually
agreed by the Parties in writing, for Additional Services, if any, Isis shall
invoice Ibis on a quarterly basis for the Additional Services.  Ibis shall
pay invoiced amounts within 45 days of receipt of the invoice.

  



  

(b) _Taxes_. Ibis shall pay any and all Taxes incurred in connection with
Isis provision of the Services, including all withholding Taxes required by
Applicable Law and all sales, use, value-added, and similar Taxes, but
excluding Taxes based on Isis net income.

  



  

 **Section 4. _Term and Termination_**.

  



  

(a) _Term_. The term of this Agreement (the " _Term_ ") shall commence on the
Closing Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to _Section
4(b)_, shall terminate at the close of business on [***]

  



  

(b) _Early Termination_. This Agreement shall automatically terminate upon
the earlier of (i) termination of the performance of the last Service or (ii)
the date Ibis is no longer occupying Isis premises. If Ibis intends to
vacate Isis premises before [***], then Ibis will provide Isis at least 30
days advance written notice.

  



  

 **Section 5. _Software License_**. Isis hereby grants to Ibis a worldwide,
fully paid, royalty free, perpetual, nonexclusive license (without the right
to grant sublicenses, except to Affiliates of Ibis) to all of Isis rights in
(a) the software programs entitled [***], and [***] (and any dependent
programs specifically referenced therein) used in support of the Ibis
manufacturing process to facilitate [***], and (b) the software application
Ibis uses to enter employee time. Such software is hereby licensed to Ibis
as-is. Each party acknowledges and agrees that Isis has provided the source
code for the software described above to Ibis.

  



  

 **Section 6. _Indemnification_**.

  



  

(a) Isis shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AMI, Ibis and their
respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, representatives,
agents and Affiliates (the " _Ibis Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against
all Losses actually suffered or incurred by them to the extent arising out of
or resulting from (i) a breach of this Agreement by Isis or any of its
Affiliates or (ii) the handling, storage, disposal or transport of any
Hazardous Materials by Isis or any of its Representatives, except, in each
case, to the extent such Losses arise out of the negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith of any Ibis Indemnified Party.

  



  

(b) Ibis shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Isis and its officers,
directors, shareholders, employees, representatives, agents and Affiliates
(the " _Isis Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Losses actually
suffered or incurred by them to the extent arising out of or resulting from
(i) a breach of this Agreement by Ibis or any of its Affiliates, (ii)
the handling, storage, disposal or transport of any Hazardous Materials by
Ibis or any of its Representatives, or (iii) the occupancy of Isis premises
by Ibis or any of its Representatives (including any Third Party invited onto
Isis premises by Ibis), except, in each case, to the extent

  



        
   

  



  

such Losses arise out of the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of
any Isis Indemnified Party.

  



  

(c) If any Third Party shall notify any Party to this Agreement (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any matter which may give rise to a
claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") for indemnification against any other Party
to this Agreement (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this _Section 6_,
then the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party thereof;
provided that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent such failure shall have actually materially prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.  Once the Indemnified Party has given notice of the
matter to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall defend against
the matter in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate.  The
Indemnifying Party may, at its sole cost and expense, participate in the
defense of such Claim with co-counsel of its choice. The Indemnified Party
will not consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to the matter or
enter into any settlement with respect to the matter without the Indemnifying
Partys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to participate in such defense if
the claim in which the Indemnifying Party seeks to participate (i) seeks non-
monetary, including injunctive, relief, (ii) involves criminal allegations
against an Indemnified Party or (iii) is one in which the Indemnifying Party
is also a party and joint representation would be inappropriate or there may
be legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from
or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(d) No Ibis Indemnified Party or Isis Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover any Losses relating to any matter arising under any provision of this
Agreement to the extent that any such Person has already recovered Losses
with respect to such matter pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 7. _Miscellaneous_**.

  



  

(a) _Limitations On Liability_. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY PUNITIVE,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARE AWARDED IN
CONNECTION WITH A THIRD PARTY CLAIM AGAINST AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY AND SUCH
INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS ENTITLED TO BE INDEMNIFIED HEREUNDER AS A RESULT OF THE
FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO SUCH THIRD PARTY CLAIM, IN NO
EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS,
EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO ANOTHER PARTY
FOR ANY PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES IN
CONNECTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ON
BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE IBIS INDEMNIFIED PARTIES OR THE ISIS INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES, AS THE CASE MAY BE, ANY CLAIM FOR SUCH DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM
FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE.

  



  

(b) _Title To Intellectual Property_. Except as explicitly provided in
_Section 5_ (Software License) Ibis acknowledges that it shall acquire no
right, title or interest (including any

  



        
   

  



  

license rights or rights of use) in any intellectual property that is owned
or licensed by Isis, by reason of the provision of the Services provided
hereunder. Ibis shall not remove or alter any copyright, trademark,
confidentiality or other proprietary notices that appear on any intellectual
property owned or licensed by Isis, and Ibis shall reproduce any such notices
on any and all copies thereof. Ibis shall not attempt to decompile,
translate, reverse engineer or make excessive copies of any intellectual
property owned or licensed by Isis, and Ibis shall promptly notify Isis of
any such attempt, regardless of whether by Ibis or any Third Party, of which
Ibis becomes aware. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any rights granted
to a Party under the Acquisition Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Force Majeure_. No Party shall be liable to another Party if, and to
the extent that, the performance or delay in performance of any of its
obligations under this Agreement is prevented, restricted, delayed or
interfered with due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of such
Party, including, but not limited to, government legislation, fires, floods,
explosions, epidemics, accidents, acts of God, wars, acts of terrorism,
riots, strikes, lockouts or other concerted acts of workers and/or acts of
government. The Party claiming an event of force majeure shall promptly
notify the other Party in writing, and provide full particulars of the cause
or event and the date of first occurrence thereof, as soon as possible after
the event and also keep the other Party informed of any further developments.
The Party so affected shall use its reasonable best efforts to remove the
cause of non-performance, and both the Parties shall resume performance
hereunder with the utmost dispatch when such cause is removed unless this
Agreement has previously been terminated under _Section 4_ (Term and
Termination).

  



  

(d) _Independent Contractors_. The Parties each acknowledge that they are
separate entities, each of which has entered into this Agreement for
independent business reasons. The relationships of the Parties hereunder are
those of independent contractors and nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to create a joint venture, partnership or any other relationship.

  



  

(e) _Survival_. _Section 1_ (Definitions), _Section 2(c)_
(Audit Assistance), _Section 3_ (Billing; Taxes), _Section 5_ (Software
License), _Section 6_ (Indemnification) and _Section 7_ (Miscellaneous),
shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(f) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly contemplated in
Section 6 with respect to Ibis Indemnified Parties and Ibis Indemnified
Parties, this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

  



  

(g) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the full and entire
understanding and agreement between the Parties with regard to the subject
hereof and no party will be liable for or bound to any other in any manner by
any oral or written representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
except as specifically set forth herein or therein.

  



  

(h) _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other Party; _provided_ that Ibis may (i) assign any or all of its rights

  



        
   

  



  

and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates, (ii) designate one
or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder (in any or all
of which cases Ibis nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance
of all of its obligations hereunder), and (c) assign any or all of its rights
and interests hereunder in connection with a Change of Control of Ibis or
AMI.

  



  

(i) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any signed
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and
any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means
of a facsimile machine or other electronic means, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party
hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or
thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other
parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise
the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or other
electronic means as a defense to the formation of a contract and each such
party forever waives any such defense.

  



  

(j) _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

(k) _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other
communications hereunder will be in writing. Any notice, request, demand,
claim, or other communication hereunder shall be deemed duly given (i) when
delivered on a Business Day, if personally delivered or sent by facsimile or
other electronic means (subject to confirmation of such delivery), on such
Business Day, (ii) when delivered other than on a Business Day, if personally
delivered or sent by facsimile or other electronic means (subject to
confirmation of such delivery), on the first Business Day after dispatch,
(iii) on the Business Day after dispatch, if sent by nationally-recognized
overnight courier, and (iv) on the third Business Day following the date of
mailing, if sent by mail, in each case, addressed to the intended recipient
as set forth below:

## **Abbott Exercises Its Option to Acquire Ibis Biosciences, a Subsidiary
of Isis**

  

## 

  

CARLSBAD, Calif. and ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Dec 17, 2008 /PRNewswire-FirstCall
via COMTEX News Network/

  



  

Total acquisition price will be $215 million

  



  

Acquisition will expand Abbotts position in molecular diagnostics
for infectious disease

  



  

Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ISIS) and Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced
today that Abbott has exercised its option to purchase the remaining equity
ownership in Ibis Biosciences, Inc., an Isis subsidiary, for a closing
purchase price of $175 million. In addition to the closing purchase price,
Isis will receive earn out payments from Abbott tied to post-closing sales of
Ibis systems, including instruments and assay kits.

  



  

Earlier this year, Abbott invested $40 million in Ibis in exchange
for approximately 18.6% of Ibis outstanding equity. This investment, along
with the $175 million that would be due at closing, would result in a
total acquisition price of $215 million plus earn out payments.

  



  

The closing of the acquisition of the remaining equity ownership in Ibis is
subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of a stock purchase
agreement that has been executed by the parties, including
obtaining clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, and is expected to occur in January, 2009.

  



  

"Abbotts confidence in Ibis is reflected in its decision to invest in Ibis
technology and to exercise its option to purchase Ibis. We have
already presented development plans for the next-generation instrument that
will facilitate our rapid growth into clinical diagnostics," said Michael
Treble, President of Ibis. "This year we have made substantial progress by
advancing our broad pathogen detection and characterization capabilities and
establishing a foundation for our commercial clinical diagnostic products. We
look forward to continuing this progress."

  



  

"The broad applicability of Ibis technology has been demonstrated
in biodefense applications, microbial forensics and infectious disease
detection and surveillance, and we believe that it has the potential to be a
powerful tool in the detection and surveillance of infectious diseases in the
hospital and clinical settings," added Stafford OKelly, Vice President,
Molecular Diagnostics, Abbott.

  



  

"Ibis is an example of Isis broad innovation, and will provide substantial
benefit to our shareholders, both now as well as in the future, as Isis
receives earn out payments associated with sales of Ibis products,"
said Stanley Crooke, M.D., Ph.D., Chairman and CEO of Isis. "Ibis has refined
its approach toward larger commercial markets, and we believe its
relationship with Abbott will allow Ibis to continue to move quickly forward
along this path."

 **EXHIBIT H**

 **ADR PROCEDURE**

  



  

To begin the ADR process, a Party first must send written notice of the
dispute to the other Party for attempted resolution by good faith
negotiations between their respective presidents (or their designees) of the
affected subsidiaries, divisions, or business units within twenty-eight (28)
days after such notice is received (all references to "days" in this
ADR provision are to calendar days). If the matter has not been resolved
within twenty-eight (28) days after the notice of dispute, or if the parties
fail to meet within such twenty-eight (28) days, either Party may initiate an
ADR proceeding as provided herein. The parties shall have the right to
be represented by counsel in such a proceeding.

  



  

1. To begin an ADR proceeding, a Party shall provide written notice to the other Party of the issues to be resolved by ADR. Within fourteen (14) days after its receipt of such notice, the other Party may, by written notice to the Party initiating the ADR, add additional issues to be resolved within the same ADR.

  



  

2. Within twenty-one (21) days following the initiation of the ADR proceeding, the Parties shall select a mutually acceptable independent, impartial and conflicts-free neutral to preside in the resolution of any disputes in this ADR proceeding. If the Parties are unable to agree on a mutually acceptable neutral within such period, each Party will select one independent, impartial and conflicts-free neutral and those two neutrals will select a third independent, impartial and conflicts-free neutral within ten (10) days thereafter. None of the neutrals selected may be current or former employees, officers or directors of either Party, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or a current consultant or independent contractor of either Party or its Affiliates.

  



  

3. No earlier than twenty-eight (28) days or later than fifty-six (56) days after selection, the neutral(s) shall hold a hearing to resolve each of the issues identified by the Parties. The ADR proceeding shall take place at a location agreed upon by the Parties. If the Parties cannot agree, the neutral(s) shall designate a location other than the principal place of business of either Party or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

  



  

4. At least seven (7) days prior to the hearing, each Party shall submit the following to the other Party and the neutral(s):

  



  

(a) a copy of all exhibits on which such Party intends to rely in any oral or
written presentation to the neutral;

  



  

(b) a list of any witnesses such Party intends to call at the hearing, and a
short summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness;

  



  

(c) a proposed ruling on each issue to be resolved, together with a request
for a specific damage award or other remedy for each issue. The proposed
rulings and remedies shall not contain any recitation of the facts or any
legal arguments and shall not exceed one (1) page per issue. The Parties
agree that neither side shall seek as part of its remedy any punitive
damages.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) a brief in support of such Partys proposed rulings and remedies,
_provided_ , that the brief shall not exceed twenty (20) pages. This page
limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR
proceeding.

  



  

Except as expressly set forth in subparagraphs 4(a) - 4(d), no discovery
shall be required or permitted by any means, including depositions,
interrogatories, requests for admissions, or production of documents.

  



  

5. The hearing shall be conducted on two (2) consecutive days and shall be governed by the following rules:

  



  

(a) Each Party shall be entitled to five (5) hours of hearing time to present
its case. The neutral shall determine whether each Party has had the five (5)
hours to which it is entitled.

  



  

(b) Each Party shall be entitled, but not required, to make an opening
statement, to present regular and rebuttal testimony, documents or other
evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to make a closing argument. Cross-
examination of witnesses shall occur immediately after their direct
testimony, and cross-examination time shall be charged against the Party
conducting the cross-examination.

  



  

(c) The Party initiating the ADR shall begin the hearing and, if it chooses
to make an opening statement, shall address not only issues it raised but
also any issues raised by the responding Party. The responding Party, if it
chooses to make an opening statement, also shall address all issues raised in
the ADR. Thereafter, the presentation of regular and rebuttal testimony and
documents, other evidence, and closing arguments shall proceed in the same
sequence.

  



  

(d) Except when testifying, witnesses shall be excluded from the hearing
until closing arguments.

  



  

(e) Settlement negotiations, including any statements made therein, shall not
be admissible under any circumstances. Affidavits prepared for purposes of
the ADR hearing also shall not be admissible. As to all other matters, the
neutral(s) shall have sole discretion regarding the admissibility of any
evidence.

  



  

6. Within seven (7) days following completion of the hearing, each Party may submit to the other Party and the neutral(s) a post-hearing brief in support of its proposed rulings and remedies, _provided_ , that such brief shall not contain or discuss any new evidence and shall not exceed ten (10) pages. This page limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR proceeding.

  



  

7. The neutral(s) shall rule on each disputed issue within fourteen (14) days following completion of the hearing. Such ruling shall adopt in its entirety the proposed ruling and remedy of one of the Parties on each disputed issue but may adopt one Partys proposed rulings and remedies on some issues and the other Partys proposed rulings and remedies on other issues. The neutral(s) shall not issue any written opinion or otherwise explain the basis of the ruling.

  



        
   

  



  

8. The neutral(s) shall be paid a reasonable fee plus expenses. These fees and expenses, along with the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing Party (including all expert witness fees and expenses), the fees and expenses of a court reporter, and any expenses for a hearing room, shall be paid as follows:

  



  

(a) If the neutral(s) rule(s) in favor of one Party on all disputed
issues in the ADR, the losing Party shall pay 100% of such fees and expenses.

  



  

(b) If the neutral(s) rule(s) in favor of one Party on some issues and
the other Party on other issues, the neutral(s) shall issue with the rulings
a written determination as to how such fees and expenses shall be allocated
among the Parties. The neutral(s) shall allocate fees and expenses in a way
that bears a reasonable relationship to the outcome of the ADR, with the
Party prevailing on more issues, or on issues of greater value or gravity,
recovering a relatively larger share of its legal fees and expenses.

  



  

9. The rulings of the neutral(s) and the allocation of fees and expenses shall be binding, non-reviewable, and non-appealable, and may be entered as a final judgment in any court having jurisdiction.

  



  

10. Except as provided in paragraph 9 or as required by law, the existence of the dispute, any settlement negotiations, the ADR hearing, any submissions (including exhibits, testimony, proposed rulings, and briefs), and the rulings shall be deemed Confidential Information. The neutral(s) shall have the authority to impose sanctions for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information.
