and be converted into the right to receive 0.48 of a share (the "Exchange
Ratio") of Purchaser Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor will be issued in the Merger; instead, Purchaser shall pay to each
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction
of a share of Purchaser Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest
cent, determined by multiplying such fraction by the average closing sales
price of Purchaser Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the ten
(10) trading days ending on the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

(d) As of the Effective Time, each Excluded Share shall be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no exchange or payment shall be
made with respect thereto. All shares of Purchaser Common Stock that are held
by the Company, if any, other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in
satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, shall be canceled and shall
constitute authorized but unissued shares.

2.6 Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited with Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions (the
"Exchange Agent"), pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to the Closing,
for the benefit of the holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, for exchange in
accordance with this Section 2.6, (i) the number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration and
(ii) any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5(b),
and Purchaser shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the Merger
Consideration. Appropriate transmittal materials ("Letter of Transmittal") in
a form satisfactory to Purchaser and the Company shall be mailed as soon as
practicable (but not later than five (5) Business Days) after the Effective
Time to each holder of record of Company Common Stock. A Letter of Transmittal
will be deemed properly completed only if the completed Letter of Transmittal
is accompanied by one or more Certificates representing Company Common Stock
(or customary affidavits and, if required by Purchaser pursuant to Section
2.6(h), indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of
such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates)
representing all shares of Company Common Stock to be converted thereby.

  



  

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate shall
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall provide to Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary
for it to perform its obligations as specified herein.

  



  

(c) The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, (ii) be in a form and
contain any other provisions as Purchaser may reasonably determine and (iii)
include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate, or, at the
election of Purchaser, a statement reflecting shares issued in book entry
form, representing that number of whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(a) and a check in
the amount equal to any cash in lieu of fractional shares such holder is
entitled to pursuant to Section 2.5(b) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled. Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. As soon as practicable (but not later than five
(5) Business Days) following receipt of the properly completed Letter of
Transmittal and any necessary accompanying documentation, the Exchange Agent
shall distribute Purchaser Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares
as provided herein. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or
exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall
receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or
distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons
entitled thereto. If there is a transfer of ownership of any shares of
Company Common Stock not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the
Certificates representing such Company Common Stock are presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required, in the reasonable
judgment of Purchaser and the Exchange Agent, to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid.

  



    

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Purchaser Common Stock issued pursuant to this
Agreement shall be remitted to any Person entitled to receive shares of
Purchaser Common Stock hereunder until such Person surrenders his or her
Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.6. Upon the surrender of such
Person's Certificates, such Person shall be entitled to receive any dividends
or other distributions, without interest thereon, which subsequent to
the Effective Time had become payable but not paid with respect to shares of
Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Person's Certificates.

  



  

(e) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
immediately upon the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of
any shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to Purchaser, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.6.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in lieu
of fractions of a share pursuant to Section 2.5, any dividends or
other distributions to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.6 or any proceeds
from any investments thereof that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company
Common Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be repaid by the
Exchange Agent to Purchaser upon the written request of Purchaser. After such
request is made, each holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this Section 2.6 shall look only to Purchaser for the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to Section 2.5 of this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any Affiliate
thereof) shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

(g) Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
the Company's stock transfer books to establish the identity of those Persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. The Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform its obligations as
specified herein. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Certificate, Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to
any claims thereto.

  



  

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of
a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.5.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.7 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Purchaser Common Stock. At the
Effective Time, and except as provided in Section 2.5(d), each share of
Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  



  

2.8 Directors of Surviving Corporation After Effective Time.
Subject to Section 5.14, immediately after the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, the
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of the directors of
Purchaser serving immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

2.9 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Certificate of
Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and
the terms thereof. The bylaws of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and the terms of such
bylaws.

  



  

2.10 Treatment of Stock Options. The Company's Disclosure Letter
sets forth each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding and unexercised as of the date hereof (collectively, a "Company
Stock Option") pursuant to the Company Equity Plans. As of the Effective
Time, all Company Stock Options outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and
be converted into an option to purchase Purchaser Common Stock (a "Converted
Stock Option"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Company Stock Option. The number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
subject to each such Converted Stock Option will be equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) obtained by multiplying (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the applicable Company
Stock Option by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, and the exercise price of Purchaser
Common Stock subject to each Converted Stock Option will be equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per Company Stock Option
by (y) the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The
adjustment provided herein with respect to any Company Stock Options which
are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the IRC) shall be
and is intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with Section
424(a) of the IRC. Except as provided above, after the Effective Time, the
Converted Stock Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Company Equity Plans and any award
agreement. At all times after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall reserve
for issuance such number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock as necessary so
as to permit the exercise of Converted Stock Options in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement and in the instruments pursuant to which such
options were granted.  Shares of Purchaser Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of Converted Stock Options shall be covered by an effective
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form), and Purchaser
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form)
covering such shares as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in
no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, and shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such Converted Stock Options remain
outstanding.

2.11 Bank Merger. Concurrently with or as soon as practicable after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Berkshire Bank, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Purchaser, and Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, shall enter into the Plan of Bank
Merger, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_, with respect to the Bank
Merger. The parties intend that the Bank Merger will become effective
simultaneously with or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

  



  

2.12 Absence of Control. It is the intent of the parties hereto that
Purchaser by reason of this Agreement shall not be deemed (until
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to control, directly or
indirectly, the Company or to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling
influence over the management or policies of the Company.

  



  

2.13 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Purchaser or Berkshire Bank shall consider or be advised that any
further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are
necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in Purchaser or Berkshire Bank its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or Savings
Institute Bank and Trust Company, or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company, the Company and
their officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to Purchaser
and Berkshire Bank an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver,
in such official corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments or
assurances in law or any other acts as are necessary or desirable to (a) vest,
perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in Purchaser or Berkshire Bank
its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Company or Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company or (b)
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of Purchaser or Berkshire Bank are authorized in the name of the
Company or Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company or otherwise to take any
and all such action.

  



  

2.14 Withholding.  Purchaser or the Exchange Agent will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof) or
the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the IRC, or any applicable provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are
properly withheld by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent.

either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a

representations and warranties contained in Section 3.2 or Section 3.3, as
applicable, or to one or more of its covenants contained in Articles IV or V
(and making specific reference to the Section of this Agreement to which they
relate). Disclosure in any paragraph of the Disclosure Letter shall apply only
to the indicated Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is
reasonably clear on the face of such disclosure (notwithstanding the absence
of a specific cross reference) that it is relevant to another paragraph of
the Disclosure Letter or another Section of this Agreement. Documents
are deemed to have been made available by Purchaser to the Company or by the
Company to Purchaser if such documents (i) were included in the virtual data

a consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such
fact, event or circumstance, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or
warranty contained in Sections 3.2 or 3.3, has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or Purchaser, as
the case may be (it being understood that, except with respect to Section
3.2(j), for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and
warranties, all "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and other materiality

(t) _Properties_.

  



  

(i) A list of all real property owned or leased by the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company is set forth in the Company's Disclosure Letter.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all
real property owned by it (including any property acquired in a judicial
foreclosure proceeding or by way of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar
transfer), in each case free and clear of any Liens, except (i) those items
which secure liabilities for public or statutory obligations or any
discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit
facilities, reverse repurchase agreements or any transaction by a Subsidiary
acting in a fiduciary capacity, (ii) liens for Taxes not yet due and payable
and (iii) such easements, restrictions and encumbrances, if any, as are not
material in character, amount or extent, and do not materially detract from
the value, or materially interfere with the present use of the properties
subject thereto or affected thereby. Each lease pursuant to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as lessee, leases real or personal property is
valid and in full force and effect as to the Company and the Subsidiaries and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other party to any such lease, is in default or in violation of
any material provisions of any such lease. The Company has previously made
available to Purchaser a complete and correct copy of each such lease. All
real property owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are
in all material respects in a good state of maintenance and repair (normal
wear and tear excepted), conform in all material respects with all applicable
ordinances, regulations and zoning laws and are considered by the Company to
be adequate for the current business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. To
the Knowledge of the Company, none of the buildings, structures or other
improvements located on any real property owned or leased by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries encroaches upon or over any adjoining parcel or real
estate or any easement or right-of-way. The Company's leases and
commitments to lease constitute or will constitute operating leases for both
tax and financial accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum
rental commitment with respect to such leases and lease commitments are as
disclosed in all material respects in the notes to the Company Financial
Statements. The Company's Disclosure Letter identifies each real estate lease
that will require the consent of the lessor or its agent as a result of the
Merger or the Bank Merger by virtue of the terms of any such lease,
identifying the section of the lease that contains such prohibition or
restriction.

  



  

(ii) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable
title to all tangible personal property owned by it, free and clear of all
Liens except such Liens, if any, that are not material in character, amount
or extent, and that do not materially detract from the value, or materially
interfere with the present use of the properties subject thereto or affected
thereby. With respect to personal property used in the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that is leased rather than owned, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under the terms of any such
lease.

GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed
in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets,
and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
general or specific authorization. Except as disclosed in the Company

were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and
collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with

accommodation to any Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
presently in default or, during the three-year period prior to the date of
this Agreement, has been in default or has been restructured, modified or
extended. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been notified

(vi) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been
asserted or instituted, and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, no set of
circumstances exists that may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim
or lawsuit, against Purchaser Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to Purchaser Benefit Plans or the assets of any of
the trusts under any of Purchaser Benefit Plans, that could reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability of Purchaser or any of its

(r) _Properties_.

  



  

(i) Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable
title to all real property owned by it (including any property acquired in a
judicial foreclosure proceeding or by way of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or
similar transfer), in each case free and clear of any Liens, except (i) those
items which secure liabilities for public or statutory obligations or any
discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit
facilities, reverse repurchase agreements or any transaction by a
Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, (ii) liens for Taxes not yet due
and payable and (iii) such easements, restrictions and encumbrances, if any,
as are not material in character, amount or extent, and do not materially
detract from the value, or materially interfere with the present use of the
properties subject thereto or affected thereby. Each lease pursuant to which
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries as lessee, leases real or personal
property is valid and in full force and effect as to Purchaser and
the Subsidiaries and neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to
the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party to any such lease, is in default
or in violation of any material provisions of any such lease. All real
property owned or leased by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries are in all
material respects in a good state of maintenance and repair (normal wear and
tear excepted), conform in all material respects with all applicable
ordinances, regulations and zoning laws and are considered by Purchaser to be
adequate for the current business of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(ii) Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable
title to all tangible personal property owned by it, free and clear of
all Liens except such Liens, if any, that are not material in character,
amount or extent, and that do not materially detract from the value, or
materially interfere with the present use of the properties subject thereto or
affected thereby. With respect to personal property used in the business of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that is leased rather than owned, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under the terms of any
such lease.

  



    

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(s) _Anti-takeover Provisions Inapplicable_. Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries have taken all actions required to exempt Purchaser, the
Agreement, the Plan of Bank Merger, the Merger and the Bank Merger from any
provisions of an anti-takeover nature contained in their
organizational documents, and the provisions of any federal or state "anti-
takeover," "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or similar
laws or regulations.

  



  

(t) _Corporate Documents and Records_. Purchaser has previously
provided a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation,
bylaws and similar organizational documents of Purchaser and each of
Purchaser's Subsidiaries, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of its
Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents. The
minute books of Purchaser and each of Purchaser's Subsidiaries constitute a
complete and correct record of all actions taken by their respective boards
of directors (and each committee thereof) and their stockholders.

  



  

(u) _CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC and Customer Information
Security_. Berkshire Bank has received a rating of "Satisfactory" or better
in its most recent examination or interim review with respect to the CRA.
Purchaser does not have Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would
cause Berkshire Bank or any other Subsidiary of Purchaser: (i) to be deemed
not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the CRA,
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for
CRA purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than "Satisfactory"; or (ii)
to be deemed to be operating in violation in any material respect of the Bank
Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money
laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets
Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or
regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any
material respect with the applicable privacy of customer information
requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws and regulations,
including without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of
1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of
the information security program adopted by Berkshire Bank. To the Knowledge
of Purchaser, no non-public customer information has been disclosed to or
accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that would cause either
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial action. The
board of directors of Berkshire Bank (or where appropriate of any other
Subsidiary of Purchaser) has adopted, and Berkshire Bank (or such other
Subsidiary of Purchaser) has implemented, an anti-money laundering program
that contains adequate and appropriate customer identification verification
procedures that comply with Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and such anti-
money laundering program meets the requirements in all material respects of
Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and
Berkshire Bank (or such other Subsidiary of Purchaser) has complied in all
material respects with any requirements to file reports and other necessary
documents as required by the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.

(v) _Internal Controls_. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have
devised and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets, and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization. There are no
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect Purchaser's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information. To the Knowledge of
Purchaser, there has occurred no fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Purchaser's internal controls over financial reporting.

  



  

(w) _Tax Treatment of the Merger_. Purchaser has no Knowledge of
any fact or circumstance relating to it that would prevent the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the IRC.

  



  

(x) _Fairness Opinion. _The board of directors of Purchaser has
received the opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally, has been or will
be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same date) of Piper Jaffray and Co.
to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the
assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth therein, the Exchange
Ratio in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to Purchaser.

material to its business. Purchaser's Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete

(a) The Company shall immediately cease, and the Company shall cause
its Subsidiaries and each of their respective representatives to
immediately cease, any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.
Except as permitted by this Section 5.1, the Company agrees that it will not,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their directors, executive
officers and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or encourage any inquiry with respect to, or the making of, any
proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding an
Acquisition Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic information relating to
an Acquisition Proposal to, any Person that has made or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) engage
in discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal with any Person that has
made, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is considering making, an
Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such Person of the existence of the
provisions of this Section 5.1.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.1(a), if, prior to the time the
Requisite Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company receives a
written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (1) furnish
nonpublic information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, but only if (A) prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company has entered into a customary
confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms no less favorable to the
Company than the confidentiality agreement by and between the Company and
Purchaser dated as of November 2, 2018, and (B) all such information has
previously been made available to Purchaser or is provided to Purchaser prior
to or contemporaneously with the time it is provided to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal or such Person's representatives; and (2) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect
to the Acquisition Proposal. The Company promptly (and in any event within 48
hours) shall advise Purchaser orally and in writing of the receipt of (i) any
Acquisition Proposal and any inquiry that is reasonably likely to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms of such proposal or inquiry
(including the identity of the party making such proposal or inquiry and,
if applicable, copies of any documents or correspondence evidencing such
proposal), and (ii) any request for information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for information not reasonably
likely to be related to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep
Purchaser informed on a reasonably current basis (and in any event at least
once every two (2) Business Days) of the status of any such Acquisition
Proposal (including any material change to its terms).

  



    

 | 57|

(c) Except as set forth in Section 5.1(d), the board of directors of
the Company shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, or modify (or publicly propose
to withhold, withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Purchaser, its
recommendation referred to in Section 5.8, or (ii) approve or recommend (or
publicly propose to approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal. Except as
set forth in Section 5.1(d), Company shall not, and its board of directors
shall not allow the Company to, and the Company shall not allow any of the
Company's Subsidiaries to, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, or other agreement (except for confidentiality agreements
permitted under Section 5.1(b)) relating to any Superior Proposal.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the board of directors of the Company may, prior to the time the
Requisite Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, in response to a Superior
Proposal which did not result from a breach of Section 5.1(a) or (b), (i)
make a Change in Recommendation and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1 (and concurrently with such termination cause Company to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal), in each
case of clauses (i) or (ii), if the board of directors of the Company has
determined in good faith, after consulting with its outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that the
board of directors may not take any such action in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal unless (1) the board of directors has determined that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (2) prior to
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f), the Company provides
prior written notice to Purchaser at least four (4) Business Days in advance
(the "Notice Period") of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify all material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and copies
of any documents or correspondence evidencing such Superior Proposal), (3)
during the Notice Period, Company shall, and shall cause its financial
advisors and outside counsel to, negotiate with Purchaser in good faith should
Purchaser propose to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the
good faith judgment of the Company's board of directors) a Superior Proposal
and (4) such Superior Proposal continues to constitute (in the good faith

to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
notice to Purchaser and again comply with the requirements of this Section

14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or, (ii) making any
disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the Company determines that such disclosure would be

the failure by it to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such

no investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made in this Agreement. Neither party
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the entity in possession or control of such information or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties will make appropriate and reasonable substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent, authorization or
approval of any third party that is required to be obtained in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Purchaser and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent
or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that such consent or approval will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such required consent or approval will be materially delayed.

  



  

5.5 Anti-takeover Provisions. The Company and its Subsidiaries
shall take all steps required by any relevant federal or state law or
regulation or under any relevant agreement or other document to exempt or
continue to exempt Purchaser, the Agreement, the Plan of Bank Merger, the

the Company's or its Subsidiaries' Articles of Incorporation and bylaws, or
similar organizational documents, and the provisions of any federal or state

5.6 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable
efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions and to
do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or

5.8 Stockholder Meeting. Company agrees to take, in accordance
with applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company and the
Bylaws of the Company, all action necessary to convene a meeting of its
stockholders to consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and any
other matters required to be approved by the Company's stockholders in order
to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any adjournment or postponement, the "Company Stockholder
Meeting") and, subject to Section 5.1, shall take all lawful action to
solicit stockholder approval. The Company agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to convene the Company Stockholder Meeting
within forty-five (45) days following the time when the
Registration Statement becomes effective. Except with the prior approval of
Purchaser, no other matters shall be submitted for the approval of the
Company's stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company's board
of directors shall at all times prior to and during the Company Stockholder
Meeting recommend approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company and shall not withhold, withdraw, amend, or modify its recommendation
in any manner adverse to Purchaser or take any other action or make any other
public statement inconsistent with their recommendation, except as and to the
extent expressly permitted by Section 5.1 (a "Change in Recommendation"). In
the event that there is present at the Company Stockholder Meeting, in person
or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting power to secure the Requisite Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company will not adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting unless the Company is advised by counsel that failure to
do so would result in a breach of the U.S. federal securities laws or
fiduciary duties of the Company's board of directors. The Company shall keep
Purchaser updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results in connection
with the Company Stockholder Meeting as reasonably requested by Purchaser.

  



  

5.9 Registration of Purchaser Common Stock.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
Purchaser shall prepare and file the Registration Statement with the SEC. The
Registration Statement shall contain proxy materials relating to the matters
to be submitted to the Company's stockholders at the Company Stockholder
Meeting and shall also constitute the prospectus relating to the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (such proxy
statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the
"Proxy Statement-Prospectus"). The Company will furnish to Purchaser the
information required to be included in the Registration Statement with
respect to its business and affairs and shall have the right to review and
consult with Purchaser and approve the form of, and any characterizations of
such information included in, the Registration Statement prior to its being
filed with the SEC. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company will use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be mailed
to its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Purchaser will
advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of
any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Purchaser Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus or the Registration Statement. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to Purchaser or the Company, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
Purchaser or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by
law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed by Purchaser with the SEC and
disseminated by the Company to its stockholders.

  



    

 | 63| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Purchaser shall also take any action required to be taken under
any applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger and
each of the Company and Purchaser shall furnish all information concerning it
and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall notify the New York
Stock Exchange of the additional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be
issued by Purchaser in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt
notice to the other of: (i) any event or notice of, or other
communication relating to, a default or event that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a default, received by it or any of
its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, under any contract material to the financial condition,
properties, businesses or results of operations of each party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which each party or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or is subject; and (ii) any event, condition, change or occurrence
that individually or in the aggregate has, or that, so far as reasonably can
be foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is reasonably likely to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and Purchaser shall give prompt
notice to the other party of any notice or other communication from any third
party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

5.11 Employee Benefit Matters.

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall honor the Company Benefit Plans set forth in the
Company's Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms of such
Company Benefit Plans, except to the extent an alternative treatment is set
forth in Section 5.11 or in Section 2.10 of this Agreement. Following the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall maintain or cause to be maintained employee
benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of all Persons
who are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and whose employment is not specifically terminated at or
prior to the Effective Time (a "Continuing Employee") that, in the aggregate
are substantially comparable to the employee benefit and compensation
opportunities that are generally made available to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries; _provided, however,_ in no event
shall any Continuing Employee be eligible to participate in any frozen plan
of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries.

  



    

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) At the sole discretion of Purchaser, Purchaser may maintain the
Company's health and welfare plans through the end of the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser
determines to terminate one or more of the Company's health and/or welfare
plans, then at the request of Purchaser made at least thirty (30) days prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt resolutions, to the extent
required, providing that one or more of the Company's health and welfare
plans (excluding any plans that are mutually agreed to in writing between the
parties) will be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time
(or such later date as requested by Purchaser in writing or as may be required
to comply with any applicable advance notice or other requirements contained
in such plans) and shall arrange for termination of all
corresponding insurance policies, service agreements and related arrangements
effective on the same date to the extent not prohibited by the terms of such
arrangements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no coverage of any of the
Continuing Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of the
Company's health and welfare plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees
or their dependents, as applicable, become eligible to participate in the
health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries and their dependents and, consequently, no Continuing
Employee shall experience a gap in coverage. Purchaser shall ensure that
Continuing Employees who become covered under health plans, programs and
benefits of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries shall receive credit for any
co-payments, eligible expenses and deductibles paid under the Company's health
plan for the plan year in which coverage commences under Purchaser's health
plan. Continuing Employees shall not be subject to any pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods under any such plans.
Terminated Company employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right
to continued coverage under group health plans of Purchaser in accordance with
COBRA.

  



  

(c) Purchaser shall cause each Purchaser Benefit Plan in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for
all purposes (including eligibility and vesting) under the Purchaser Benefit
Plans all service of such employees with Company (and/or its Subsidiaries) to
the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by the Company
(and/or its Subsidiaries); provided, however, that such service shall not be
recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits under any of the Purchaser Benefit Plans or Company
bonus plans, including without limitation any cash bonuses paid for 2019
pursuant to Section 4.1(i)(i) of this Agreement, or (ii) to the extent, at
the sole discretion of Purchaser, the cash value of unused vacation is paid
to Continuing Employees at the Effective Time. This Agreement shall not be
construed to limit the ability of Purchaser to terminate the employment of
any Company employee or to review any employee benefit plan or program from
time to time and to make such changes (including terminating any such plan or
program) as Purchaser deems appropriate.

  



  

(d) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to
cause the Company 401(k) Plan to be frozen as to future
contributions effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and Purchaser
shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to allow the
Continuing Employees to participate in Purchaser's 401(k) Plan on the first
day immediately following the Effective Time. If requested in writing by
Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days prior to Closing, the Company will
also take all necessary steps to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Time, and if further requested, shall prepare and submit a request
to the IRS for a favorable determination letter on termination. If Purchaser
requests that the Company apply for a favorable determination letter, then
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as are
necessary (determined in consultation with Purchaser) to submit the
application for favorable determination letter in advance of the Effective
Time, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall use its best efforts
in good faith to obtain such favorable determination letter as promptly as
possible (including, but not limited to, making such changes to the
Company 401(k) Plan as may be required by the IRS as a condition to its
issuance of a favorable determination letter). Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser, will adopt such
amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan to effect the provisions of this
Section 5.11(d). In the event Purchaser requests the Company to submit an
application to the IRS for a determination letter, Company 401(k) Plan
participants who are terminated at or after the Closing, but prior to the
receipt of the IRS determination letter, may elect to receive a distribution
from the Company 401(k) Plan upon termination of their employment. Purchaser
shall take any and all actions as may be required to permit Continuing
Employees to roll over their account balances in the Company's 401(k) Plan
into Purchaser's 401(k) Plan; however, plan loans may not be rolled over into
Purchaser's 401(k) Plan.

  



    

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Subject to the occurrence of the Closing, the Company ESOP shall
be terminated by the Company prior to the Closing Date. In connection with
the termination of the Company ESOP and the merger of the Company with
Purchaser, all accounts shall be fully vested, all outstanding indebtedness
of the Company ESOP shall be repaid by delivering a sufficient number of
unallocated shares of Company Common Stock to the Company, at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, all remaining shares of Company
Common Stock held by the Company ESOP shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and the balance of the unallocated shares
and any other unallocated assets remaining in the Company ESOP after repayment
of the Company ESOP loan shall be allocated as earnings to the accounts of
the Company ESOP participants who are employed as of the date of termination
of the Company ESOP based on their account balances under the Company ESOP as
of the date of termination of the Company ESOP and distributed to
Company ESOP participants after the receipt of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
such actions as are necessary (determined in consultation with Purchaser) to
submit the application for favorable determination letter in advance of the
Effective Time, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall use its best
efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable determination letter as
promptly as possible (including, but not limited to, making such changes to
the Company ESOP as may be required by the IRS as a condition to its issuance
of a favorable determination letter). The Company and following the Effective
Time, Purchaser, will adopt such amendments to the Company ESOP to effect the
provisions of this Section 5.11(e). Promptly following the receipt of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of
the Company ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in the Company
ESOP shall either be distributed to participants and beneficiaries
or transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual
retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct.

  



  

(f) Purchaser agrees that each Company employee who is involuntarily
terminated by Purchaser (other than for "Cause" as determined by Purchaser)
at or within twelve months following the Effective Time and who is not covered
by a separate severance, change in control or employment agreement shall
receive a severance payment pursuant to the Company's severance plan or policy
in effect as of the date hereof, as applicable, or Purchaser's severance plan
or policy, as applicable, if such payments would be more favorable to such
Person; provided, however, that in no event shall such severance payments
exceed twelve month's pay.

  



    

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) Purchaser shall honor and maintain the Amended and Restated
Director Retirement Agreements as set forth in the Company's
Disclosure Letter, except to the extent any such agreement is superseded,
with the consent of the beneficiary, as of, or following, the Effective Time
and Purchaser specifically agrees that the timing and amount of the payments
thereunder will not be accelerated and will continue to be made in accordance
with the terms of such agreements.

  



  

(h) Purchaser shall honor all obligations under the employment or
change in control agreements as set forth in the Company's Disclosure Letter,
except to the extent any such agreement is superseded or terminated as of, or
following, the Effective Time. To the extent any payments or benefits made
with respect to, or which could arise as a result of, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, could be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the IRC, the
Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, cooperate in good faith with
Purchaser to effect reasonable measures to minimize any such payments or
benefits from being characterized as "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the IRC.

  



  

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall honor the
Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan, Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan II and other similar arrangements.

  



  

(j) The Company shall take all such actions as Purchaser may
reasonably request to fully and timely comply with any and all
requirements of both federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act of 1988 ("WARN Act") and any state-specific WARN Act statutes, including
providing notices to the Company's employees.

  



  

5.12 Indemnification.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless each of the current or former directors, officers or employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party"), and
any Person who becomes an Indemnified Party between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, based in whole or in part
on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact
that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or was prior to
the Effective Time serving at the request of any such party as a director,
officer, employee, trustee or partner of another corporation, partnership,
trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other entity or (ii) any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to the fullest extent such Person would have been indemnified or
have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to the Company's Articles
of Incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement and as
permitted by applicable law, and Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall
also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification.

  



    

 | 67| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 5.12(a), upon learning of any action, suit, proceeding
or investigation described above, shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof.
Any failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Purchaser under
Section 5.12(a) unless and to the extent that Purchaser is actually prejudiced
as a result of such failure.

  



  

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy with respect to
claims against such Persons arising from facts or events occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser may (i) request
that the Company obtain an extended reporting period endorsement under the

consolidates with or merges into any other Person or entity and shall not

abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time, by action taken or
authorized by the board of directors of the terminating party, either before
or after any requisite stockholder approval:

  



  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and the Company; or

  



  

(b) by either Purchaser or the Company, in the event of the failure
of the Company's stockholders to approve the Agreement at the Company
Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall only be
entitled to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this clause if it has
complied in all material respects with its obligations under Section 5.8;

  



  

(c) by either Purchaser or the Company, if either (i) any approval,
consent or waiver of a Governmental Entity required to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied and
such denial has become final and non-appealable or (ii) any court or other
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final,
unappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(d) by either Purchaser or the Company, if the Merger is not
consummated by December 31, 2019, unless the failure to so consummate by such
time is due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein;

  



  

(e) by either Purchaser or the Company (provided that the party
seeking termination is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), in
the event of a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the other
party set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the
other party shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and (b) or Sections 6.3(a) and (b), as the case
may be, would not be satisfied and such breach or untrue representation or
warranty has not been or cannot be cured within thirty (30) days
following written notice to the party committing such breach or making such
untrue representation or warranty;

  



    

 | 72| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) By Company if at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause unless:

  



  

(i) the Company shall have complied with Section 5.1 of this
Agreement, including the conclusion by the board of directors of the
Company in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(ii) the board of directors of the Company concurrently approves, and
the Company concurrently enters into, a definitive agreement with respect to
the Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(iii) the Company concurrently pays the Termination Fee payable
pursuant to Section 7.2.

  



  

(g) At any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, by
Purchaser if (i) the Company shall have materially breached its
obligations under Section 5.1, (ii) the board of directors of the Company
shall have failed to make its recommendation referred to in Section 5.8 or

shall have failed to publicly recommend against such tender or exchange offer
within five (5) Business Days of being requested to do so by Purchaser, or
(v) the Company shall have materially breached its obligations under Section
5.8 by failing to call, give notice of, convene, and hold the Company
Stockholder Meeting in accordance with Section 5.8; or

  



  

(h) By the Company, at any time during the five-day period
commencing with the Determination Date, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:

  



  

(i) The number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (as defined below) (the "Purchaser Ratio") shall be less than
0.80; and

  



  

(ii) (x) the Purchaser Ratio shall be less than (y) the number
obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the
Starting Date (each as defined below) and subtracting 0.20 from the quotient

to herein as the "Index Ratio");

  



    

 | 73| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If the Company elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 7.1(h), it shall give
written notice to Purchaser (provided that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day
period). During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such
notice, Purchaser shall have the option to increase the consideration to be
received by the holders of Company Common Stock hereunder, by adjusting the
Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one-thousandth) to equal the lesser
of (x) a number (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth) obtained by dividing
(A) the product of the Starting Price, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio (as then
in effect) by (B) the Average Closing Price and (y) a number (rounded to the
nearest one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Index
Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Purchaser
Ratio. If Purchaser so elects within such five-day period, it shall give
prompt written notice to the Company of such election and the revised
Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this
Section 7.1(h) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

  



  

For purposes of this Section 7.1(h) the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

  



  

"Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of Purchaser Common
Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the twenty (20)
consecutive full trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to
the Determination Date.

  



  

"Determination Date" shall mean 10th day prior to the Closing Date, provided
that if shares of Purchaser Common Stock are not actually traded on the New
York Stock Exchange on such day, the Determination Date shall be the
immediately preceding day to the 10th day prior to the Closing Date on which
shares of Purchaser Common Stock actually trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.

  



  

"Final Index Price" shall mean the average of the Index Prices for the twenty
(20) consecutive full trading days ending on the trading day immediately
prior to the Determination Date.

  



  

"Index Price" shall mean the closing price on such date of the NASDAQ Bank
Index.

  



  

"Starting Date" shall mean the last trading day immediately preceding the
date of the first public announcement of entry into this Agreement.

  



  

"Starting Price" shall mean the closing price of a share of Purchaser Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (as reported in The Wall Street
Journal, or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source) on the

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.2 Termination Fee.

  



  

(a) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities
foregone by Purchaser while structuring and pursuing the Merger, the Company
shall pay to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds a
termination fee equal to $7,400,000 (the "Termination Fee"):

   



  

(i) in the event the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(f), in which case the Company shall pay the Termination Fee at or
prior to the time of such termination, and

  



  

(ii) in the event Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(g), in which case Company shall pay the Termination Fee
as promptly as practicable (but in any event within three (3) Business Days
of termination).

  



  

(b) In the event that (A) (i) an Acquisition Proposal, whether or
not conditional, shall have been publicly announced after the date of this
Agreement (or any Person shall have, after the date of this Agreement,
publicly announced an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an
Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) the board of directors of the Company has made a
Change in Recommendation (or publicly proposed to make a Change in
Recommendation), prior to or on the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting
(including any adjournment or postponement at which the vote on the Merger is
held), (B) this Agreement is thereafter terminated by either Purchaser or
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b), by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d), or by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(e), provided that the breach
of the Company giving rise to such termination was knowing or intentional and,
at the time of such termination, Purchaser is not in material breach of any
representation, warranty or material covenant contained herein, and (C) within
twelve (12) months following the date of such termination, the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Transaction, the
board of directors of the Company recommends any Acquisition Transaction or
Company consummates any Acquisition Transaction (whether or not such
Acquisition Transaction resulted from or was related to the Acquisition
Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause (A)(i), if applicable), then the
Company shall pay Purchaser the Termination Fee, which amount shall be payable
by wire transfer of immediately available funds on or prior to the earlier of
the Company entering into a definitive agreement for or consummating such
Acquisition Transaction, provided, however, that for purposes of this clause
(C), all references in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" to "20% or
more" shall instead refer to "50% or more".

  



  

(c) Company and Purchaser each agree that the agreements contained
in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Purchaser would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any
amounts due under this Section 7.2 and, in order to obtain such payment,
Purchaser commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for
such amounts, the Company shall pay interest on such amounts from the date
payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the rate of
interest equal to the sum of (x) the rate of interest published from time to
time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any successor
publication), designated therein as the prime rate on the date such payment
was due, plus 200 basis points, together with the costs and expenses of
Purchaser (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with
the suit.

  



    

 | 75| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, if the Company pays or causes to be paid to Purchaser or to
Berkshire Bank the Termination Fee, neither the Company nor Savings Institute
Bank and Trust Company (or any successor in interest of the Company or
Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company) nor any of their officers, directors
or Affiliates will have any further obligations or liabilities to Purchaser
or Berkshire Bank with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, except in the case of fraud or willful
misconduct, payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole remedy of
Purchaser in the event of termination of this Agreement on the bases
specified in Sections 7.2(a) and (b).

  



  

7.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Purchaser or the Company as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and, subject to Section 7.2, have no
effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto or
their respective officers and directors, except that (i) Sections 5.3(c), 7.2
and 8.6, shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of
its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

8.10 Severability.  If any one or more provisions of this Agreement
shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality

8.11 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be

provisions hereof (including the parties' obligation to consummate the
Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any

Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection
with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the
extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in Person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any
amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or
e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of
a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
