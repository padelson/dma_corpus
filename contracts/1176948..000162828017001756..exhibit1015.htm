Section 3. Representations and Warranties.



(a) Each Borrower, individually as to itself only, represents and warrants to
the Lenders and the Agent, that this Agreement has been duly executed and

as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,

principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).



(b) Each Borrower represents and warrants that on the date hereof the
representations and warranties of such Borrower set forth in Article IV of the
Credit Agreement are true, correct and complete in all material respects on

shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date;
provided, further that, any representation and warranty that is qualified as
to "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar language shall be true
and correct in all respects on such respective dates.



(c) For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from
and after August 5, 2015, the Borrower and the Agent shall treat (and the
Lenders hereby authorize the Agent to treat) the Amended Credit Agreement as
not qualifying as a "grandfathered obligation" within the meaning of Treasury

(d) No Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists or would result

otherwise affect the rights and remedies of the Lenders or the Agent under the
Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, and shall not alter, modify,
amend or in any way affect any of the terms, conditions, obligations,
covenants or agreements contained in the Credit Agreement or any other
provision of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, all of which are
ratified and affirmed in all respects and shall continue in full force and
effect.



Section 6. Confirmation of Loan Documents. As of the date hereof and after
giving effect to this Agreement, the Borrower hereby confirms and ratifies all
of its obligations under the 

Execution Version



Credit Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is a party. By its
execution on the respective signature lines provided below, as of the date
hereof and after giving effect to this Agreement, each of the Guarantors
hereby (a) confirms and ratifies all of its obligations and (b) represents and
warrants that the representations and warranties set forth herein, the Credit
Agreement and in such other Loan Documents are true and correct in all
material respects on the date hereof as if made on and as of such date (except
to the extent that any representation or warranty expressly relates to an
earlier date, in which case such representation or warranty shall have been
true and correct as of such earlier date); provided that any representation
and warranty that is qualified as to materiality or material adverse effect
shall, after giving effect to such qualifications as set forth therein, be
true and correct in all respects. This Agreement is deemed to be a "Loan
Document" for the purposes of the Credit Agreement.



Section 7. Miscellaneous. Except as herein provided, the Credit Agreement
shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same amendatory instrument and any of the parties
hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. Delivery of
a counterpart by electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart hereof. This Agreement and any right, remedy,
obligation, claim, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of

Agent in accordance with Section 2.6 or Section 2.7, as applicable. Each Base
Rate Loan shall be denominated in Dollars. Each Base Rate Loan shall be in a
minimum principal amount of $500,000 and, thereafter, in integral multiples of

otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and except payments
to be made directly to an Issuing Lender as expressly provided herein and

therein) are payable in Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower
shall fail to pay any principal of any Advance when due (whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise) or shall fail
to pay any reimbursement obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit when
due, the unpaid portion of such Advance or reimbursement obligation shall, if
such Advance or reimbursement obligation is not denominated in Dollars,
automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, if such
due date in respect of any such Advance is a day other than the last day of
the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an
amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such
redenomination and such principal or reimbursement obligation shall be payable
on demand; and if Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Advance or on
any reimbursement obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit, or any other
amount (other than any principal or reimbursement obligation), that is not
denominated in Dollars, such interest or other amount shall automatically be
redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date in
respect of any such Advance is a day other than the last day of the Interest
Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal
to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such
interest or other amount shall be payable on demand.

Unless the Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on
which any payment is due to the Agent for account of the Lenders or the
respective Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such
payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such
date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the
amount due. In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then
each of the Lenders or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally
agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to
such Lender or such Issuing Lender with interest thereon at the Defaulting
Lender Rate, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to Defaulting Lenders and except as
otherwise provided in the Loan Documents (including agreements between Agent
and individual Lenders), aggregate principal and interest payments shall be
apportioned ratably among the Lenders (according to the unpaid principal
balance of the Obligations to which such payments relate held by each Lender)
and applied thereto and payments of fees and expenses (other than fees or
expenses that are for Agent's separate account, after giving effect to any
agreements between Agent and individual Lenders) shall be apportioned ratably
among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

Subject to Section 2.3(d)(iii) below, all payments shall be remitted to Agent
and all such payments shall be applied as follows:

first, to pay any fees and Lender Group Expenses then due to Agent under the

second, to pay any fees and Lender Group Expenses then due to the Lenders
under the Loan Documents, on a ratable basis, until paid in full,

third, ratably to pay interest due in respect of the Loans until paid in full,

fourth, so long as no Application Event has occurred and is continuing, to pay
the principal of all Advances until paid in full,

fifth, if an Application Event has occurred and is continuing, ratably (i) to
pay the principal of all Advances until paid in full, and (ii) to Agent, to be
held by Agent, for the ratable benefit of the respective Issuing Lender and
those Lenders having a Revolver Commitment, as cash collateral in an amount up
to 102% of the Letter of Credit Usage until paid in full,

sixth, if an Application Event has occurred and is continuing, to pay any
other Obligations until paid in full, and

seventh, to Borrower (to be wired to the Ares Holdings Designated Account or
Ares Investments Designated Account, as directed by the Administrative Entity)
or such other Person entitled thereto under applicable law.

Agent promptly shall distribute to each Lender, pursuant to the applicable
wire instructions received from each Lender in writing, such funds as it may
be entitled to receive.

In each instance, so long as no Application Event has occurred and is
continuing, Section 2.3(d)(i) shall not apply to any payment made by Borrower
to Agent and specified by Borrower to be for the payment of specific
Obligations then due and payable (or prepayable) under any provision of this
Agreement.

For purposes of the foregoing, "paid in full" means payment of all amounts
owing under the Loan Documents according to the terms thereof, including loan
fees, service fees, professional fees, interest (and specifically including
interest accrued after the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding), default
interest, interest on interest, and expense reimbursements, whether or not any
of the foregoing would be or is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part in
any Insolvency Proceeding, other than any contingent and unasserted
indemnification or similar Obligations.

In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this
Section 2.3 and other provisions contained in any other Loan Document, it is
the intention of the parties hereto that such priority provisions in such
documents shall be read together and construed, to the fullest extent
possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of any actual,
irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and
provisions of this Section 2.3 shall control and govern. 

Execution Version



Subject to Section 2.4, each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest upon the
unpaid principal balance thereof, from and including the date advanced or
converted, to but excluding the date of conversion or repayment thereof, at a
fluctuating rate, per annum, equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable
Margin. Any change in the interest rate resulting from a change in the Base
Rate will become effective on the day on which each change in the Base Rate is
announced by Agent. Interest due with respect to Base Rate Loans shall be due
and payable, in arrears, commencing on the first Interest Payment Date
following the Restatement Effective Date, and continuing on each Interest
Payment Date thereafter up to and including the Interest Payment Date
immediately preceding the Maturity Date, and on the Maturity Date.

Subject to Section 2.4, each LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest upon the
unpaid principal balance thereof, from the date advanced, converted, or
continued, at a rate, per annum, equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable
Margin. Interest due with respect to each LIBOR Rate Loan shall be due and
payable, in arrears, on each Interest Payment Date applicable to that LIBOR
Rate Loan and on the Maturity Date. Anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement notwithstanding, Borrower may not have more than 10 LIBOR Rate Loans
outstanding at any one time.

Borrower shall pay Agent (for the ratable benefit of the Lenders with a
Revolver Commitment), a Letter of Credit fee (in addition to the charges,
commissions, fees, and costs set forth in Section 2.10(f)) which shall accrue
at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin times the Daily Balance of the
undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit (the "Letter of Credit
Fee"). The Letter of Credit Fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears
on the first day of each quarter.

Unless prepaid in accordance with the terms hereof, the outstanding principal
balance of all Advances, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
shall be due and payable, in full, on the Maturity Date.

Any Lender by written notice to Borrower (with a copy to Agent) may request
that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the
Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note,
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2, payable to the order of such Lender
(or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns).
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon
shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9) be
represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order
of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note,
to such payee and its registered assigns). For the avoidance of doubt,
assignments of any Loans by Lenders (irrespective of whether promissory notes
are issued hereunder) shall be in accordance with the provisions of Section 9
of this Agreement. In no event shall the delivery of a promissory note
pursuant to this Section 2.3(i) constitute a condition precedent to any
extension of credit hereunder.

Default Rate 

Execution Version



. (i) If any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount
payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated
maturity, upon acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a
rate per annum equal to (A) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above plus 2.0 percentage
points or (B) in the case of any other amount, 2.0 percentage points plus the
rate applicable to Base Rate Loans as provided above and (ii) upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (A) all Loans
then outstanding shall bear interest at a rate equal to the rate otherwise
applicable to such Loan plus 2.0 percentage points, and (B) the Letter of
Credit Fee shall be increased to 2.0 percentage points above the per annum
rate otherwise applicable thereunder. All amounts payable under this Section
2.4 shall be due and payable on demand by Agent.

Computation of Interest and Fees Maximum Interest Rate; Letter of Credit Fee

.

All computations of interest with respect to the Loans and computations of the
fees (including the Letter of Credit Fee) due hereunder for any period shall
be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days
elapsed in such period (except in the case of Loans denominated in British
Pounds Sterling or Base Rate Loans, which shall be 365/366 days). Interest
shall accrue from the first day of the making of a Loan (or the date on which
interest or fees or other payments are due hereunder, if applicable) to (but
not including) the date of repayment of such Loan (or the date of the payment
of interest or fees or other payments, if applicable) in accordance with the
provisions hereof.

Request for Borrowing

.

Each Base Rate Loan shall be made on a Business Day and each LIBOR Rate Loan
shall be made on a Eurodollar Business Day.

Each Loan or Letter of Credit that is proposed to be made after the
Restatement Effective Date shall be made upon written notice, by way of a
Request for Borrowing, which Request for Borrowing shall be irrevocable and
shall be given by facsimile, mail, electronic mail (in a format bearing a copy
of the signature(s) required thereon), or personal service, and delivered to
Agent and Issuing Bank as provided in Section 11.3.

for a Base Rate Loan, Borrower shall give Agent notice at least one (1)
Business Day prior to the date that is the requested Funding Date, and such
notice shall specify that a Base Rate Loan is requested and state the amount
thereof (subject to the provisions of this Article II). 

Execution Version



for a LIBOR Rate Loan, Borrower shall give Agent notice at least three (3)
Eurodollar Business Days before the date the LIBOR Rate Loan is to be made,
and such notice shall specify that a LIBOR Rate Loan is requested and state
the amount and Interest Period thereof (subject to the provisions of this
Article II); provided, however, that no Loan shall be available as a LIBOR
Rate Loan when any Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing. At any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Agent may convert, and shall convert if so requested by the
Required Lenders, the interest rate on all outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans to the
rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder. If Borrower fails to
designate a Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan in accordance herewith, the Loan will be
a Base Rate Loan. In connection with each LIBOR Rate Loan, Borrower shall
indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders harmless against any loss,
cost, or expense incurred by Agent or any Lender as a result of (A) the
payment of any principal of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on the last day of
an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (B) the conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or (C) the failure to borrow,
convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Rate Loan on the date specified in any
Request for Borrowing or Request for Conversion/Continuation delivered
pursuant hereto (such losses, costs, and expenses, collectively, "Funding
Losses"). Funding Losses shall, with respect to Agent or any Lender, be deemed
to equal the amount determined by Agent or such Lender to be the excess, if
any, of (I) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal
amount of such LIBOR Rate Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBOR Rate
that would have been applicable thereto, for the period from the date of such
event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the
case of a failure to borrow, convert, or continue, for the period that would
have been the Interest Period therefor), minus (II) the amount of interest
that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest
rate which Agent or such Lender would be offered were it to be offered, at the
commencement of such period, Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period
in the London interbank market. A certificate of Agent or a Lender delivered
to Borrower setting forth any amount or amounts that Agent or such Lender is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.6(b)(ii) shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

If the notice provided for in clause (b) of this Section 2.6 (i) with respect
to a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan denominated in Dollars is received by
Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. New York time or (ii) with respect to a LIBOR
Rate Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency is received by Agent not
later than 10:00 a.m. London time, on a Business Day or Eurodollar Business
Day, as applicable, such day shall be treated as the first Business Day or
Eurodollar Business Day, as applicable, of the required notice period. In any
other event, such notice will be treated as having been received immediately
before 1:00 p.m. New York time (or 10:00 a.m. London time), of the next
Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as applicable, and such day shall be
treated as the first Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as applicable,
of the required notice period. 

Execution Version



Each Request for Borrowing shall specify, among other information, (i) whether
the applicable Loan or Letter of Credit will be used for the Loan Parties'
general working capital purposes or to fund an Investment in a Fund (and if
the latter, the identity of the Fund(s) that the proceeds of such Loan will be
used by Borrower to invest in and the amount of each such Investment, if
applicable), (ii) after giving effect to such Loan or Letter of Credit, the
outstanding amount of Loans and Letters of Credit that have been used to
finance an Investment in each Fund (by such Fund), and the outstanding amount
of all Loans and Letters of Credit that have been used for the Loan Parties'
general working capital purposes, (iii) with respect to any Fund as to which
the proceeds of Loans are to be used to fund investments, the fair market
value of the investments of the Loan Parties in such Fund, (iv) with respect
to any Margin Securities held by any Loan Party, a description of such Margin
Securities as well as the fair market value thereof as of the date of such
Request for Borrowing and (v) the amount of the proceeds of such Loan that
will be made available to each of Ares Holdings, Ares Investments, or another
entity comprising Borrower.

Promptly after receipt of a Request for Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.6(b),
Agent shall notify the Lenders not later than 2:00 p.m. Local Time, on the
Business Day immediately preceding the Funding Date applicable thereto (in the
case of a Base Rate Loan), or the third Eurodollar Business Day preceding the
Funding Date (in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan), by telecopy, electronic mail
(in a format bearing a copy of the signature(s) required thereon), telephone,
or other similar form of transmission, of the requested Loan. Each Lender
shall make the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the requested Loan
available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agent's Account, not
later than 1:00 p.m. Local Time on the Funding Date applicable thereto. After
Agent's receipt of the proceeds of such Loans, Agent shall make the proceeds
thereof available to Borrower on the applicable Funding Date by (x)
transferring to the Ares Holdings Designated Account immediately available
funds equal to the proceeds that are requested by Borrower to be sent to Ares
Holdings or another entity comprising Borrower (other than Ares Investments)
in the applicable Request for Borrowing, and (y) transferring to the Ares
Investments Designated Account immediately available funds equal to the
proceeds that are requested by Borrower to be sent to Ares Investments in the
applicable Request for Borrowing; provided, however, that Agent shall not
request any Lender to make, and no Lender shall have the obligation to make,
any Loan if Agent shall have actual knowledge that (1) one or more of the
applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied
on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Loan unless such condition
has been waived, or (2) the requested Loan would exceed the Availability on
such Funding Date.

Unless Agent receives notice from a Lender on or prior to the Restatement
Effective Date or, with respect to any Loan after the Restatement Effective
Date, prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date of such Loan, that such
Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to Agent for the
account of Borrower the amount of that Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Loan,
Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will make such amount available
to Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date and Agent may (but
shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to 

Execution Version



the extent any Lender shall not have made its full amount available to Agent
in immediately available funds and Agent in such circumstances has made
available to Borrower such amount, that Lender shall on the Business Day
following such Funding Date make such amount available to Agent, together with
interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day during such period. A
notice submitted by Agent to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under
this subsection shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount is
so made available, such payment to Agent shall constitute such Lender's Loan
on the date of such Loan for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is
not made available to Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date,
Agent will notify Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent,
Borrower shall pay such amount to Agent for Agent's account, together with
interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Loan, at a rate
per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans
comprising such Loan, without in any way prejudicing the rights and remedies
of Borrower against the Defaulting Lender. The failure of any Lender to make
any Loan on any Funding Date shall not relieve any other Lender of any
obligation hereunder to make a Loan on such Funding Date, but no Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made
by such other Lender on any Funding Date.

If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it
pursuant to Section 2.10(d), 2.6(f) or 8.2, then the Agent may, in its
discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Agent for the account of such Lender for
the benefit of the Agent or the respective Issuing Lender to satisfy such
Lender's obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied
obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated
account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding
obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Agent in its
discretion.

All Advances shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in accordance
with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (i) no Lender shall be
responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to
make any Advance (or other extension of credit) hereunder, nor shall any
Revolver Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any
failure by any other Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) no
failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any
other Lender from its obligations hereunder.

Conversion or Continuation

.

Subject to the provisions of clause (d) of this Section 2.7 and the provisions
of Section 2.14, Borrower shall have the option to (i) convert all or any
portion of the outstanding Base Rate Loans equal to $500,000, and integral
multiples of $100,000 in excess of such amount, to a LIBOR Rate Loan, (ii)
convert all or any portion of the outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans denominated in
Dollars equal to $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of such
amount, to a Base Rate Loan, and (iii) upon the 

Execution Version



expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any of its LIBOR Rate Loans,
continue all or any portion of such LIBOR Rate Loan equal to $500,000, and
integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of such amount, as a LIBOR Rate Loan
denominated in the same Currency, and the succeeding Interest Period of such
continued Loan shall commence on the expiration date of the Interest Period
previously applicable thereto; provided, however, that a LIBOR Rate Loan only
may be converted or continued, as the case may be, on the expiration date of
the Interest Period applicable thereto; provided further, however, that no
outstanding Loan may be continued as, or be converted into, a LIBOR Rate Loan
when any Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing; provided further, however, that if, before the expiration of an
Interest Period of a LIBOR Rate Loan, Borrower fails timely to deliver the
appropriate Request for Conversion/Continuation, such LIBOR Rate Loan, in the
case of a LIBOR Rate Loan denominated in Dollars, automatically shall be
converted to a Base Rate Loan and, in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan
denominated in an Alternative Currency, automatically shall be continued as a
LIBOR Rate Loan having an Interest Period of one month.

Borrower shall by facsimile, mail, electronic mail (in a format bearing a copy
of the signature(s) required thereon), personal service or by telephone (which
shall be confirmed by one of the other means of delivery) deliver a Request
for Conversion/Continuation to Agent (i) no later than 1:00 p.m., Local Time,
one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed conversion date (in the case of a
conversion to a Base Rate Loan), and (ii) no later than 1:00 p.m. Local Time,
three (3) Eurodollar Business Days before (in the case of a conversion to, or
a continuation of, a LIBOR Rate Loan). A Request for Conversion/Continuation
shall specify (x) the proposed conversion or continuation date (which shall be
a Business Day or a Eurodollar Business Day, as applicable), (y) the amount
and type of the Loan to be converted or continued, and (z) the nature of the
proposed conversion or continuation.

Any Request for Conversion/Continuation (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof)
shall be irrevocable and Borrower shall be obligated to convert or continue in
accordance therewith.

No Loan (or portion thereof) may be converted into, or continued as, a LIBOR
Rate Loan with an Interest Period that ends after the Maturity Date.

Mandatory Repayment

.

The Revolver Commitments, including any commitment to issue any Letter of
Credit, shall terminate on the Maturity Date and all Loans, all interest that
has accrued and remains unpaid thereon, all contingent reimbursement
obligations of Borrower with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit, all
unpaid fees, costs, or expenses that are payable hereunder or under any other
Loan Document, and all other Obligations immediately shall be due and payable
in full, without notice or demand (including either (i) providing 

Execution Version



cash collateral to be held by Agent in an amount equal to 102% of the Letter
of Credit Usage, or (ii) causing the original Letters of Credit to be returned
to Agent), on the Maturity Date.

(i) On the last Business Day of each quarter and, in addition, promptly upon
the receipt by the Agent of a Currency Valuation Notice (as defined below),
the Agent shall determine the aggregate Revolving Credit Facility Usage and
Letter of Credit Usage. For the purpose of this determination, the outstanding
principal amount of any Loan or the undrawn amount of any outstanding Letter
of Credit that is denominated in any Alternative Currency shall be deemed to
be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount in the Alternative Currency of such
Loan or Letter of Credit, determined as of such quarterly date or, in the case
of a Currency Valuation Notice received by the Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New
York time on a Business Day, on such Business Day or, in the case of a
Currency Valuation Notice otherwise received, on the first Business Day after
such Currency Valuation Notice is received. Upon making such determination,
the Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and the Borrower thereof.

(i)In the event that, as of the date of such determination, the sum of the
then outstanding Revolving Credit Facility Usage and the Letter of Credit
Usage exceeds 105% of the then extant amount of the Maximum Revolver Amount,
then, and in each such event, promptly upon obtaining notice of such excess
(and in any event within three (3) Business Days of obtaining such notice)
Borrower shall repay such amount or cash collateralize Letters of Credit as
shall be necessary so that the outstanding Revolving Credit Facility Usage and
the Letter of Credit Usage does not exceed the then extant amount of the
Maximum Revolver Amount.

(ii)For purposes hereof, "Currency Valuation Notice" means a notice given by
the Required Lenders to the Agent stating that such notice is a "Currency
Valuation Notice" and requesting that the Agent determine the aggregate
Revolving Credit Facility Usage and Letter of Credit Usage. The Agent shall
not be required to make more than one valuation determination pursuant to
Currency Valuation Notices within any rolling three month period.

All prepayments of the Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall (i) prior
to the Maturity Date, so long as no Application Event shall have occurred and
be continuing, be applied ratably to the outstanding principal amount of the
Advances until paid in full, (ii) if an Application Event shall have occurred
and be continuing, be applied in the manner set forth in Section 2.3(d)(i),
and (iii) so long as an Event of Default has not occurred and is not
continuing, to the extent that such prepayments are to be applied to the
Advances pursuant to Section 2.8(c)(i) above, be applied, first, ratably to
Advances that are Base Rate Loans, until paid in full, and, second, ratably to
Advances that are LIBOR Rate Loans, until paid in full.

Voluntary Prepayments; Termination and Reduction in Commitments

. 

Execution Version



Borrower shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, to prepay
the Loans without penalty or premium. Borrower shall give Agent written notice
not less than 1 Business Day prior to any such prepayment with respect to Base
Rate Loans and not less than 3 Eurodollar Business Days prior written notice
of any such prepayment with respect to LIBOR Rate Loans. In each case, such
notice shall specify the date on which such prepayment is to be made (which
shall be a Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as applicable), and the
amount of such prepayment. Each such prepayment shall be in an aggregate
minimum amount of $1,000,000 and shall include interest accrued on the amount
prepaid to, but not including, the date of payment in accordance with the
terms hereof (or, in each case, such lesser amount constituting the amount of
all Loans then outstanding). Any voluntary prepayments of principal by
Borrower of a LIBOR Rate Loan prior to the end of the applicable Interest
Period shall be subject to Section 2.6(b)(ii).

Borrower has the option, at any time upon 3 Business Days prior written notice
to Agent, to terminate this Agreement and terminate the Revolver Commitments
hereunder without penalty or premium by paying to Agent, in cash, the
Obligations (including contingent reimbursement obligations of Borrower with
respect to outstanding Letters of Credit, but excluding contingent
indemnification obligations in respect of claims that are unasserted and
unanticipated) in full (including either (i) providing immediately available
funds to be held by Agent for the benefit of those Lenders with a Revolver
Commitment in an amount equal to 102% of the Letter of Credit Usage, or (ii)
causing the original Letters of Credit to be returned to each respective
Issuing Lender); provided that the Revolver Commitments shall not be
terminated if after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in
accordance with Section 2.9(a), the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit
Facility Usage and Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the aggregate amount of
the Revolver Commitments. Promptly following receipt of any notice, Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.9(b) shall be irrevocable; provided that a
notice of termination of the Revolver Commitments delivered by Borrower may
state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by Borrower (by notice to
Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not
satisfied. If Borrower has sent a notice of termination pursuant to the
provisions of this Section, then (subject to the proviso in the preceding
sentence) the Revolver Commitments shall terminate and Borrower shall be
obligated to repay the Obligations (including contingent reimbursement
obligations of Borrower with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit, but
excluding contingent indemnification obligations in respect of claims that are
unasserted and unanticipated) in full on the date set forth as the date of
termination of this Agreement in such notice (including either (I) providing
immediately available funds to be held by Agent for the benefit of those
Lenders with a Revolver Commitment in an amount equal to 102% of the Letter of
Credit Usage, or (II) causing the original Letters of Credit to be returned to
each respective Issuing Lender). Any termination of the Revolver Commitments
shall be permanent.

Borrower has the option, at any time upon 3 Business Days prior written notice
to Agent, to reduce the Revolver Commitments without penalty or premium 

Execution Version



to an amount not less than the sum of (A) the Revolving Credit Facility Usage
as of such date, plus (B) the principal amount of all Advances not yet made as
to which a request has been given by Borrower under Section 2.6(b), plus (C)
the amount of all Letters of Credit not yet issued as to which a request has
been given by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.10(a) plus (D) the Letter of
Credit Usage. Each such reduction shall be in an amount which is not less than
$500,000 (unless the Revolver Commitments are being reduced to zero and the
amount of the Revolver Commitments in effect immediately prior to such
reduction are less than $500,000). Each notice delivered by Borrower pursuant
to this Section 2.9(c) shall be irrevocable. Subject to Section 2.18, once
reduced, the Revolver Commitments may not be increased. Each such reduction of
the Revolver Commitments shall reduce the Revolver Commitments of each Lender
proportionately in accordance with its Pro Rata Share thereof.

Letters of Credit

.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including without
limitation the provisions of Article III and this Section 2.10(a)), the Total
Commitments may be utilized in addition to the Loans provided for in Section
2.1, upon the request of Borrower made in accordance herewith not later than
seven (7) days before the Maturity Date, by the issuance by an Issuing Lender
selected by Borrower of letters of credit denominated in Dollars or in an
Alternative Currency for the account of Borrower (each, including the Existing
Letters of Credit, a "Letter of Credit"), such Issuing Lender shall amend,
renew or extend any Letter of Credit. Each request for the issuance of a
Letter of Credit, or the amendment, renewal, or extension of any outstanding
Letter of Credit, shall be made in writing by any of the individuals
identified on Exhibit R-1 attached hereto (or, in certain cases, two of such
individuals, all as set forth in further detail in Exhibit R-1 attached
hereto) and delivered to the respective Issuing Lender and Agent via hand
delivery, facsimile, or other electronic method of transmission reasonably in
advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension.
Each such request shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the
respective Issuing Lender in its sole and absolute discretion and shall
specify (i) the Issuing Lender, (ii) the amount of such Letter of Credit,
(iii) the date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of such Letter of
Credit, (iv) the expiration of such Letter of Credit, (v) the name and address
of the beneficiary thereof, (vi) whether such Letter of Credit is to be
denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency (and if to be denominated in
an Alternative Currency, the Alternative Currency in which such Letter of
Credit is to be denominated) and (vii) such other information (including, in
the case of an amendment, renewal, or extension, identification of the
outstanding Letter of Credit to be so amended, renewed, or extended) as shall
be necessary to prepare, amend, renew, or extend such Letter of Credit. It is
hereby acknowledged that an Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue a
Letter of Credit (A) if, after giving effect to the issuance of such requested
Letter of Credit, (1) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $200,000,000,
(2) the Letter of Credit usage would exceed such Issuing Lender's Letter of
Credit Commitment, or (3) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Maximum
Revolver Amount less the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility Usage, (B) at
any time when one 

Execution Version



or more of the Lenders is a Defaulting Lender, but only until such time as
either (1) the Revolver Commitments of the Defaulting Lender or Defaulting
Lenders have been assumed by a Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender, or (2)
the Maximum Revolver Amount has been reduced by the amount of such Defaulting
Lender's or Defaulting Lenders' Revolver Commitments, (C) if any order,
judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its
terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Lender from issuing such
Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or
request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of
credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon
such Issuing Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction,
reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise
compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Restatement Effective Date, or
shall impose upon such Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense
which was not applicable on the Restatement Effective Date and which such
Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it, or (D) if the issuance of
such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing
Lender applicable to letters of credit generally. Agent shall provide a report
to each Lender on a quarterly basis setting forth the then current Letter of
Credit Usage and Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof.

Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the
date twelve months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit
(or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, twelve months after the
then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit, so long as such renewal
or extension occurs within three months of such then-current expiration date).

(i) If an Issuing Lender shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a
Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender in respect
of such L/C Disbursement by paying to the Agent an amount equal to such L/C
Disbursement not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on (x) the Business
Day that the Borrower receives notice of such L/C Disbursement, if such notice
is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (y) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time, provided that, if such L/C
Disbursement is in Dollars and is not less than $500,000, the Borrower may,
prior to the Maturity Date and subject to the conditions to borrowing set
forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.6 that such payment be
financed with a Base Rate Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so
financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged
and replaced by the resulting Base Rate Loan.

(iii)If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Agent shall
notify each applicable Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement, the payment
then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Pro Rata Share
thereof. 

Execution Version



(i) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of
Credit increasing the amount thereof) by an Issuing Lender, and without any
further action on the part of such Issuing Lender or the Lenders, such Issuing
Lender hereby grants to each Lender (other than the respective Issuing
Lender), and each Lender (other than the respective Issuing Lender) hereby
acquires from such Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit
equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that
its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect
of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected
by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension
of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of any Event of
Default or Unmatured Event of Default or reduction or termination of the
applicable Total Commitments; provided that no Lender shall be required to
purchase a participation in a Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section
2.10(d) if (x) the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 would not be satisfied
in respect of a credit extension at the time such Letter of Credit was issued
and (y) the Required Lenders shall have so notified such Issuing Lender in
writing and shall not have subsequently determined that the circumstances
giving rise to such conditions not being satisfied no longer exist; provided
further that the obligation of the Lenders to participate in Letters of Credit
issued prior to the Maturity Date and remaining outstanding thereafter shall
continue solely to the extent that the Borrower shall have defaulted in its
obligation to cash collateralize such Letters of Credit on the Maturity Date
as required by Section 2.8(a).

(ii) In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for account of the
respective Issuing Lender, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each L/C
Disbursement made by such Issuing Lender in respect of Letters of Credit
promptly upon the request of such Issuing Lender at any time from the time of
such L/C Disbursement until such L/C Disbursement is reimbursed or cash
collateralized by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment
or cash collateral is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.
Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or
reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.6(e) with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and
Sections 2.6(e) and (f) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Lenders), and the Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing
Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following
receipt by the Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to Section
2.10(c), the Agent shall distribute such payment to such Issuing Lender or, to
the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to
reimburse such Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Lender as
their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Lender for any L/C Disbursement shall not
constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse such L/C Disbursement.

The Borrower's obligation to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in
paragraph (c) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement under any 

Execution Version



and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity
or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein,
(ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to
be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being
untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the respective Issuing
Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other
document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of
Credit, and (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this
Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower's
obligations hereunder (other than payment in full by the Borrower).

Neither the Agent, the Lenders, any Issuing Lender, any Agent-Related Person
nor any Lender-Related Person, shall have any liability or responsibility by
reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of
Credit by an Issuing Lender or any payment or failure to make any payment
thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the
preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in
transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or
relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a
drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any
consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Lender;
provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing
Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as
opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived
by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the
Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Lender's gross negligence or willful
misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under
a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly
agree that:



(i) an Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in
substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of
documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit;



(ii) an Issuing Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents
are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and



(iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by an
Issuing Lender when determining whether drafts and other documents presented
under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto
hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care
inconsistent with the foregoing).



Any and all charges, commissions, fees, and costs incurred by an Issuing
Lender relating to Letters of Credit shall be Lender Group Expenses for
purposes of this Agreement and immediately shall be reimbursable by Borrower
to Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender; it being acknowledged and
agreed by Borrower that, as of 

Execution Version



the Restatement Effective Date, the issuance charge imposed by an Issuing
Lender is 0.25% per annum times the undrawn amount of each Letter of Credit,
and that an Issuing Lender also imposes a schedule of charges for amendments,
extensions, drawings, and renewals.

(g) If the Borrower shall be required to cash collateralize Letter of Credit
Usage pursuant to Section 2.3, Section 2.8, Section 2.9 or Section 7.2, the
Borrower shall immediately deposit into a segregated collateral account or
accounts (herein, collectively, the "Letter of Credit Collateral Account") in
the name and under the dominion and control of the Agent cash denominated in
the currency of the Letter of Credit under which such Letter of Credit Usage
arises in an amount equal to the amount required under Section 2.3, Section
2.8(a), Section 2.9 or Section 7.2, as applicable. Such deposit shall be held
by the Agent as collateral in the first instance for the Letter of Credit
Usage for the applicable Issuing Lender(s) under this Agreement, and for these
purposes the Borrower hereby grants a security interest to the Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders and the other Issuing Lenders in the Letter of Credit
Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined in the Uniform
Commercial Code) or other property held therein.

Fees

.

Commitment Fee. A commitment fee shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears, on the first day of each quarter, in an amount equal to the
Applicable Margin times the result of (i) the Maximum Revolver Amount at such
time, less (ii) the sum of (A) the average Daily Balance of Advances that were
outstanding during the immediately preceding quarter, plus (B) the average
Daily Balance of the Letter of Credit Usage during the immediately preceding
quarter.

Fee Letter Fees. Borrower shall pay as and when due and payable under the
terms of each Fee Letter, the fees set forth therein.

Maintenance of Records; Effect

. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice records
evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each
Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts and currency of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The
Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the amount and
Currency of each Loan made hereunder, the type thereof and each Interest
Period therefor, (ii) the amount and currency of any principal or interest due
and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount and currency of any sum received by the Agent
hereunder for account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. The
entries made in the records maintained pursuant to this Section shall be prima
facie evidence, absent obvious error, of the existence and amounts of the
obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the
Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner
affect the 

Execution Version



obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

Increased Costs

.

Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:

impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the
LIBOR Rate) or any Issuing Lender; or

impose on any Lender or any Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any
other condition (other than Excluded Taxes, Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
of such Lender or Issuing Lender covered under Section 2.23) affecting this
Agreement or LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Rate Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or
such Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Lender,
as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

Capital Requirements. If any Lender or any Issuing Lender determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have
the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing
Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's
holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made
by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the
Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, to a level below that which
such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's
holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's policies and the policies
of such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender or
such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's holding company for any such reduction
suffered.

Certificates from Lenders. A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Lender
setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or
such 

Execution Version



Issuing Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender
or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any
such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

Notice: Delay in Requests. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees to use
reasonable efforts to notify the Borrower upon becoming aware of any Change in
Law giving rise to a right to compensation pursuant to this Section.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay on the part of any Lender
or Issuing Lender to give any such notice to the Borrower or to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section shall constitute a waiver of such
Lender\'s or Issuing Lender's right to demand such compensation or otherwise
form the basis of any liability of such Lender or Issuing Lender to Borrower;
provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an
Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions
incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing
Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such
Issuing Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions
is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

Market Disruption and Alternate Rate of Interest

.

If at the time that the Agent shall seek to determine the relevant Screen Rate
on the Quotation Day for any Interest Period for a LIBOR Rate Loan the
applicable Screen Rate shall not be available for such Interest Period and/or
for the applicable Currency with respect to such LIBOR Rate Loan for any
reason and the Agent shall determine that it is not possible to determine the
Interpolated Rate (which conclusion shall be conclusive and binding absent
manifest error), then the applicable Reference Bank Rate shall be the Base
LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period for such LIBOR Rate Loan; provided,
however, if less than two Reference Banks shall supply a rate to the Agent for
purposes of determining the Base LIBOR Rate for such LIBOR Rate Loan then (i)
if such Advance shall be requested in Dollars, such Advance shall be made as a
Base Rate Loan at the Base Rate and (ii) if such Advance shall be requested in
any Alternative Currency either, at Borrower\'s election, (A) any Request for
Borrowing that requests a LIBOR Rate Loan denominated in the affected Currency
shall be ineffective or (B) for each Lender the Base LIBOR Rate for such LIBOR
Rate Loan shall be the cost to such Lender to fund its pro rata share of such
LIBOR Rate Loan (from whatever source and using whatever methodologies as such
Lender may select in its reasonable discretion).

If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Rate Loan (the
Currency of such Loan herein called the "Affected Currency") the Agent is
advised by the Required Lenders that the LIBOR Rate or the Base LIBOR Rate, as
applicable, for a Loan in the applicable currency or for the applicable
Interest Period will not adequately 

Execution Version



and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their
Loans included in such Advance for such Interest Period then, if the Affected
Currency is Dollars, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and
the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter
and, until the Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Request for
Conversion/Continuation that requests the conversion of any Revolver
Commitment to, or continuation of any Revolver Commitment as, a LIBOR Rate
Loan shall be ineffective and (ii) any Request for Borrowing or Request for
Conversion/Continuation shall be made as a Base Rate Loan. If the Affected
Currency is an Alternative Currency, then either, at Borrower's election (A)
any Request for Borrowing that requests a LIBOR Rate Loan in such Affected
Currency shall be ineffective and any Request for Conversion/Continuation of a
LIBOR Rate Loan denominated in such Affected Currency shall be ineffective
and, on the last day of the then current Interest Period, such LIBOR Rate Loan
shall be prepaid by the Borrower, together with accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and all other amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement or
(B) for each Lender the Base LIBOR Rate for such LIBOR Rate Loan shall be the
cost to such Lender to fund its pro rata share of such LIBOR Rate Loan (from
whatever source and using whatever methodologies as such Lender may select in
its reasonable discretion).

Illegality

. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it
becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to honor its
obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans in any Currency hereunder,
then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy to
the Agent), such Lender's obligation to make, convert or continue LIBOR Rate
Loans in such Currency shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may
again make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans in such Currency, and if applicable
law shall so mandate, such Lender's LIBOR Rate Loans in such Currency shall be
prepaid by the Borrower, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon and
all other amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement, on or before
such date as shall be mandated by such applicable law.

Place of Loans

. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate the Lenders (or Agent on behalf
thereof) to obtain the funds to make any Loan in any particular place or
manner and nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute a representation by
Agent or any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain such funds in any
particular place or manner.

Survivability

. Borrower's obligations under Section 2.13 hereof shall survive repayment of
the Loans made hereunder and termination of the Revolver Commitments for a
period of 90 days after such repayment and termination.

Increase in Revolver Commitments. 

Execution Version



Administrative Entity may, by written notice to Agent and the Lenders, elect
to request increases in the existing Revolver Commitments and the Maximum
Revolver Amount (each increase that satisfies the terms and conditions of this
Section 2.18, an "Approved Increase") by an aggregate amount, for all such
increases under this Section 2.18, that does not exceed $250,000,000.00. Each
Approved Increase shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 unless
otherwise agreed by Agent. Each such notice shall specify (i) the amount of
the proposed increase, if any, to the existing Revolver Commitments and the
Maximum Revolver Amount, (ii) the date on which such increase shall become
effective (the "Increase Effective Date"), and (iii) the identity of each
Lender or other Eligible Transferee to whom Administrative Entity proposes any
portion of such increased or new Revolver Commitments be allocated and the
amounts of such allocations; provided that any Lender or other Eligible
Transferee approached to provide all or a portion of the increased or new
Revolver Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide
such increased or new Revolver Commitment and Maximum Revolver Amount, and the
Revolver Commitments, the Maximum Revolver Amount, and the Total Commitments
shall only be increased to the extent of Revolver Commitments agreed to be
provided by Lenders or Eligible Transferees. Any Eligible Transferee who
agrees to provide such increased or new Revolver Commitment and Maximum
Revolver Amount shall execute a joinder agreement to which such Eligible
Transferee and Agent (whose consent thereto shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) are party (the "Increase Joinder"). If such proposed Lender agrees
to execute an Increase Joinder in connection with an Approved Increase, such
Increase Joinder may, without the consent of any other Lender, effect such
amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary
or appropriate, in the opinion of Agent, to effect the provisions of this
Section 2.18. In connection with any such Approved Increase, Borrower shall
execute and deliver to Agent (with sufficient additional originals thereof for
each Lender) a new Form U-1 (together with such other documentation as Agent
shall reasonably request, if any) in order to enable Agent and the Lenders to
comply with any of the requirements under Regulations T, U or X of the Federal
Reserve Board. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references
in this Agreement and any other Loan Document to Loans shall be deemed, unless
the context otherwise requires, to include Loans made pursuant to the
increased Revolver Commitments made pursuant to this Section 2.18.

The increased Revolver Commitments and Maximum Revolver Amount with respect to
an Approved Increase shall become effective as of such Increase Effective
Date; provided that each of the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 shall be
satisfied.

The terms and provisions of Loans made pursuant to an Approved Increase shall
be identical to the terms and provisions applicable to the relevant Loans made
immediately prior to such Increase Effective Date.

To the extent any Advances or Letters of Credit are outstanding on the
Increase Effective Date when the Revolver Commitments and the Maximum Revolver
Amount are increased, each of the Lenders having a Revolver Commitment prior
to the Increase Effective Date (the "Revolver Pre-Increase Lenders") shall
assign to any Lender 

Execution Version



which is acquiring a new or additional Revolver Commitment on the Increase
Effective Date (the "Revolver Post-Increase Lenders"), and such Revolver Post-
Increase Lenders shall purchase from each Revolver Pre-Increase Lender, at the
principal amount thereof, such interests in the Advances and participation
interests in Letters of Credit on such Increase Effective Date as shall be
necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and
purchases, such Advances and participation interests in Letters of Credit will
be held by Revolver Pre-Increase Lenders and Revolver Post-Increase Lenders
ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Share after giving effect to such
increased Revolver Commitments.

The Loans and Revolver Commitments established pursuant to this Section shall
constitute Loans and Revolver Commitments under, and shall be entitled to all
the benefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and
shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from the
guarantees and security interests created by the Loan Documents.

Exchange Rates; Currency Equivalents

.

At any time, any reference in the definition of the term "Alternative
Currency" or in any other provision of this Agreement to the currency of any
particular nation means the lawful currency of such nation at such time
whether or not the name of such currency is the same as it was on the
Restatement Effective Date. The outstanding principal amount of any Loan or
Letter of Credit that is denominated in any Alternative Currency shall be
deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the Alternative Currency
of such Loan or Letter of Credit. Wherever in this Agreement in connection
with a Loan or Letter of Credit an amount, such as a required minimum or
multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Loan or Letter of Credit is
denominated in an Alternative Currency, such amount shall be the relevant
Alternative Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest
1,000 units of such Alternative Currency).

Each obligation hereunder of any party hereto that is denominated in the
national currency of a state that is not a Participating Member State on the
Restatement Effective Date shall, effective from the date on which such state
becomes a Participating Member State, be redenominated in euro in accordance
with the legislation of the European Union applicable to the European Monetary
Union; provided that, if and to the extent that any such legislation provides
that any such obligation of any such party payable within such Participating
Member State by crediting an account of the creditor can be paid by the debtor
either in euros or such national currency, such party shall be entitled to pay
or repay such amount either in Euros or in such national currency. If the
basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in this Agreement with respect
to an Alternative Currency of any country that becomes a Participating Member
State after the date on which such currency becomes an Alternative Currency
shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market
for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the euro, such
convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis effective as of and
from the date on which such state becomes a Participating Member State;
provided that, with respect to any Loan 

Execution Version



denominated in such currency that is outstanding immediately prior to such
date, such replacement shall take effect at the end of the Interest Period
therefor.

Without prejudice to the respective liabilities of the Borrower to the Lenders
and the Lenders to the Borrower under or pursuant to this Agreement, each
provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of
construction as the Agent may from time to time, in consultation with the
Borrower, reasonably specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the
introduction or changeover to the euro in any country that becomes a
Participating Member State after the Restatement Effective Date; provided
that, the Agent shall provide the Borrower and the Lenders with prior notice
of the proposed change with an explanation of such change in sufficient time
to permit the Borrower and the Lenders an opportunity to respond to such
proposed change.

Joint and Several Liability of Each of the Entities Comprising Borrower

.

Each of the entities comprising Borrower expects to derive benefit, directly
or indirectly, from each of the Loans made to each of the entities comprising
Borrower since the successful operation of each of the entities comprising
Borrower is dependent on the continued successful performance of the
integrated group. Each of the entities comprising Borrower is accepting joint
and several liability hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in
consideration thereof, in consideration of the financial accommodations to be
provided by the Lender Group under this Agreement, for the mutual benefit,
directly and indirectly, of each of the entities comprising Borrower and in
consideration of the undertakings of the each of the other entities comprising
Borrower to accept joint and several liability for the Obligations.

Each of the entities comprising Borrower, jointly and severally, hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a
co-debtor, joint and several liability with the each of the other entities
comprising Borrower, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the
Obligations (including any Obligations arising under this Section 2.20), it
being the intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be
the joint and several obligations of each of the entities comprising Borrower
without preferences or distinction among them.

If and to the extent that any of the entities comprising Borrower shall fail
to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or
to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then
in each such event each of the other entities comprising Borrower will make
such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation.

The Obligations of each of the entities comprising Borrower under the
provisions of this Section 2.20 constitute the absolute and unconditional,
full recourse Obligations of each of the entities comprising Borrower
enforceable against each of the entities comprising Borrower to the full
extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of 

Execution Version



the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other
circumstances whatsoever.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each of the entities
comprising Borrower, solely with respect to any action taken or not taken by
the other entity comprising Borrower, hereby waives notice of acceptance of
its joint and several liability, notice of any Advances or Letters of Credit
issued under or pursuant to this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of any
Unmatured Event of Default, Event of Default, or of any demand for any payment
under this Agreement, notice of any action at any time taken or omitted by
Agent or Lenders under or in respect of any of the Obligations, any
requirement of diligence or to mitigate damages and, generally, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, all demands, notices and other formalities of
every kind in connection with this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement). Each of the entities comprising Borrower, solely with respect
to any action taken or not taken by the other entity comprising Borrower,
hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the
time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any payment
of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any
waiver, consent or other action or acquiescence by Agent or Lenders at any
time or times in respect of any default by any of the entities comprising
Borrower in the performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition
or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by
Agent or Lenders in respect of any of the Obligations, and the taking,
addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times,
of any security for any of the Obligations or the addition, substitution or
release, in whole or in part, of any of the entities comprising Borrower.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the entities
comprising Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure
to act on the part of any Agent or Lender with respect to the failure by any
of the entities comprising Borrower to comply with any of its respective
Obligations, including, without limitation, any failure strictly or diligently
to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable
laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this
Section 2.20 afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving any of
the entities comprising Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its
Obligations under this Section 2.20, it being the intention of each of the
entities comprising Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder
remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of each of the entities comprising
Borrower under this Section 2.20 shall not be discharged except by payment in
full (or cash collateralization, cancellation or expiration in the case of
Letters of Credit). The Obligations of each of the entities comprising
Borrower under this Section 2.20 shall not be diminished or rendered
unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation,
reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to any of the entities
comprising Borrower or any Agent or Lender.

Each of the entities comprising Borrower represents and warrants to Agent and
Lenders that such entity comprising Borrower is currently informed of the
financial condition of each of the other entities comprising Borrower and of
all other circumstances which a diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear
upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations. Each of the entities
comprising Borrower further represents 

Execution Version



and warrants to Agent and Lenders that such entity comprising Borrower has
read and understands the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents. Each of
the entities comprising Borrower hereby covenants that such entity comprising
Borrower will continue to keep informed of Borrowers' financial condition, the
financial condition of other guarantors, if any, and of all other
circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the
Obligations.

Each of the entities comprising Borrower waives all rights and defenses
arising out of an election of remedies by Agent or any Lender, even though
that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to
security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed Agent's or such Lender's
rights of subrogation and reimbursement against such entity comprising
Borrower by the operation of Section 580(d) of the California Code of Civil
Procedure or otherwise.

The provisions of this Section 2.20 are made for the benefit of Agent, Lenders
and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by it or them
from time to time as permitted by the terms of this Agreement against any or
all of the entities comprising Borrower as often as occasion therefor may
arise and without requirement on the part of Agent, Lender, successor or
assign first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its
or their rights against any of the entities comprising Borrower or to exhaust
any remedies available to it or them against any of the entities comprising
Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any
of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of
this Section 2.20 shall remain in effect until all of the Obligations shall

. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply
for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 

Execution Version



commitment fees pursuant to Section 2.11(a) shall cease to accrue on the
unfunded portion of the Revolver Commitment of such Defaulting Lender;

the Revolving Credit Facility Usage and Letter of Credit Usage of such
Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required
Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to
any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 11.2);
provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting
Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the
consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby;

if any Letter of Credit Usage exists at the time such Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender then:

all or any part of the Letter of Credit Usage of such Defaulting Lender shall
be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting
Lenders' Revolving Credit Facility Usage plus such Defaulting Lender's Letter
of Credit Usage does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders'
Revolver Commitments and provided that at no time shall the sum of any
Lender's aggregate Advances and such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate
Letter of Credit Usage exceed such Lender's Revolver Commitment;

if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only
partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within two Business Days following
notice by the Agent, cash collateralize for the benefit of each Issuing Lender
only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's
Letter of Credit Usage in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
2.10;

if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's
Letter of Credit Usage pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not
be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section
2.3(g) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Usage during
the period such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Usage is cash
collateralized;

if the Letter of Credit Usage of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated
pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to
Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.3(g) shall be adjusted in accordance with such
non-Defaulting Lenders' Pro Rata Share; and

if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Usage is
neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii)
above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Lender
or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section
2.3(g) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Usage shall
be payable to the respective Issuing Lender until and to the extent that such
Letter of Credit Usage is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and 

Execution Version



so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, an Issuing Lender shall not be
required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is
satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then
outstanding Letter of Credit Usage will be 100% covered by the Revolver
Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be
provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.22(c), and participating
interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated
among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.22(c)(i)
(and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).

If (a) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a parent of any Lender shall occur
following the Restatement Effective Date and for so long as such event shall
continue or (b) an Issuing Lender has a good faith belief that any Lender has
defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in
which such Lender commits to extend credit, such Issuing Lender shall not be
required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, or an Issuing
Lender shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender,
satisfactory to such Issuing Lender to defease any risk to it in respect of
such Lender hereunder.

In the event that the Agent, the Borrower, and such Issuing Lender each agrees
that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such
Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Letter of Credit Usage of the
Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's
Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the
Loans of the other Lenders as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in
order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata
Share.

Taxes

.

Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be
required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments,
then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making
all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section) the Agent, each Lender or each Issuing Lender (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions
and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Lender,
within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Agent, such Lender or such
Issuing Lender, 

Execution Version



as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Lender, or by the Agent on
its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the
Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such
Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting
such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the
Agent

Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on the date on
which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under any Loan Document (and from
time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the
Agent), two original copies of whichever of the following is applicable: (i)
in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty
to which the United States is a party (1) with respect to payments of interest
under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN (or any subsequent versions thereof
or successors thereto) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.
federal withholding tax pursuant to the "interest" article of such tax treaty
and (2) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document,
IRS Form W-8BEN (or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto)
establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax
pursuant to the "business profits" or "other income" article of such tax
treaty, (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or
any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto), (iii) in the case of a
Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest
under section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect
that such Foreign Lender qualifies for such exemption and (y) duly completed
copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any subsequent versions
thereof or successors thereto), (iv) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8IMY, together with forms and certificates described in clauses
(i) through (iii) above (and Forms W-9 and additional Form W-8IMYs) as may be
required or (v) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
claiming exemption from or a reduction in tax duly completed together with
such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to
permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be
made. In addition, in each of the foregoing circumstances, each Foreign Lender
shall deliver such forms, if legally entitled to deliver such forms, promptly
upon the obsolescence, expiration or invalidity of any form previously
delivered by such Foreign Lender. Each Foreign Lender shall promptly notify
the Borrower (or such other relevant Loan Party) at any time it determines
that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered
certificate to the Borrower (or any other 

Execution Version



form of certification adopted by the United States or other taxing authorities
for such purpose).

Any Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on or prior to the date
on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to
time thereafter as prescribed by applicable law or upon the request of the
Borrower or the Agent), duly executed and properly completed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or W-8, as applicable, certifying that it is
not subject to U.S. federal backup withholding.

If a payment made to a Foreign Lender under any Loan Document would be subject
to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Foreign Lender were
to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as
applicable), such Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent,
at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such documentation prescribed by
applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the
Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Agent as may be necessary for the applicable withholding agent to
comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Foreign Lender
has complied with such Foreign Lender's obligations under FATCA or to
determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

If the Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has
received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay over such refund to
the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional
amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or
Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of
the Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by
the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided
that the Borrower, upon the request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to
repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or
other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Agent or
such Lender in the event the Agent or such Lender is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to
require the Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the
Borrower or any other Person.

For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and
after August 5, 2015, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat
(and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) this
Agreement as not qualifying as a "grandfathered obligation" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i) or 1.471-2T(b)(2)(i).

Mitigation of Obligations 

Execution Version



. If any Lender or Issuing Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.23,
then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending
office for funding or booking its Loans or obligations in respect of any
Letters of Credit issued hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the
judgment of such Lender or Issuing Lender, such designation or assignment (i)
would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.13 or 2.23,
as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender or
Issuing Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender or Issuing Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees
to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or Issuing
Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

Financial Statements of the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries on a Stand
Alone Basis, so long as PTP is subject to the reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act, the filing of PTP's report on Form 10-Q for such fiscal quarter
shall satisfy the requirements of this clause (i), so long as such Form 10-Q
is concurrently furnished (which may be by a link to a website containing such
document sent by automated electronic notification) to the Agent upon filing
thereof, and, (ii) a reconciliation (that may be part of the financial
statements) prepared by a Financial Officer of PTP or its general partner (if
applicable) and indicating the differences between (x) the statement of

Subsidiaries, (iii) the LP Annual Financial Statements or LP Quarterly
Financial Statements, as the case may be (or, solely to the extent delivered
in any period, the annual financial statements or quarterly financial

condition and statement of operations of the Loan Parties and their

shall include any Subsidiary all or substantially all of the assets of which
are equity interests (or equity and debt interests) in a Foreign Subsidiary),
then the Loan Parties shall not be required to comply with Section 5.7(a) if
(i) compliance could reasonably result in any material adverse tax consequence
to the Loan Parties or the IPO Entity, or (ii) could cause any Loan Party to
have an inclusion in income under Section 956 of the Code.



Obligation to Upstream Management Fees and Incentive Fees

its failure to do so could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Borrower, and each Guarantor shall duly qualify to conduct business
in all jurisdictions where its failure to do so could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Loan Parties taken as a whole.

provided that (a) immediately before and after such designation, no Event of

merger, consolidation or reorganization, such Loan Party expressly reaffirms
its Obligations, if any, to the Lender Group under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents to which it is a party (provided, in the case of any Loan
Party other than the Borrower, such reaffirmation may be provided within 5
Business Days of the consummation of such transaction), and (ii) the
consummation of such merger, consolidation or reorganization does not result
in a Change of Control Event; and

the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice and to the
extent not otherwise material to the Loan Parties and their Restricted
Subsidiaries; provided that all of the proceeds of such liquidation, winding
up or dissolution allocable to the direct or indirect ownership in such
Subsidiary of Borrower or any other Loan Party are distributed to the direct

Restricted Subsidiary may dispose of any property (including any investment)
(a) in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices or
so long as such disposition would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (b) so long as such disposition would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse 

Execution Version



Effect, to any Person in the ordinary course pursuant to the terms of a

interests of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or with any
Affiliate of Borrower or of any such holder, in each case other than a Loan
Party, on terms taken as a whole that are less favorable to Borrower than
those terms that might be obtained at the time from Persons who are not such a
holder, Subsidiary, or Affiliate, or if such transaction is not one in which
terms could be obtained from such other Person, on terms that are not
negotiated in good faith on an arm's length basis. Prior to Borrower or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries engaging in any such transaction described in this
Section 6.8, other than transactions in de minimis amounts, Borrower shall
determine that such transaction has been negotiated in good faith and on an
arm's length basis. In no event shall the foregoing restrictive covenant apply

the use, transfer, or other disposition of any Assets, to the extent that (i)
the Distribution by Borrower of such Assets would not have violated this
Agreement and (ii) such use, transfer, or other disposition would not
otherwise result in an Event of Default or an Unmatured Event of Default or
(h) transactions approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors
(or similar governing body) of the general partner of PTP (or of the PTP, as
applicable) (which committee shall be comprised of at least one independent

consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, agree to any amendment
to or waiver of the terms or provisions of its Governing Documents except for:
(i) immaterial amendments or waivers permitted by such Governing Documents not
requiring the consent of the holders of the Securities in the applicable Loan
Party or Restricted Subsidiary, or 

Execution Version

collectively, be materially adverse to the interests of the Lender Group.

officers, employees and agents shall not use, the proceeds of any Loan or
Letter of Credit (A) in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or
authorization of the payment or giving of money, or anything else of value, to

manner that would result in the violation of any Sanctions applicable to any
party hereto.

Board, or any other regulation of such board, or to violate the Exchange Act,
or to violate the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Execution Version



in which the Lender Group's rights and remedies are to be exercised. All
payments received by Agent shall be applied in accordance with Section
2.3(d)(i).





EXPENSES AND INDEMNITIES

Expenses

. Irrespective of whether any Loans are made hereunder, Borrower agrees to pay
on demand any and all Lender Group Expenses.

Indemnity

.

In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, and
irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
Borrower agrees to indemnify, exonerate, defend, pay, and hold harmless the
Agent-Related Persons, the Lender-Related Persons, and each Participant
(collectively the "Indemnitees" and individually as "Indemnitee") from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, causes of action, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses, and
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel for such Indemnitees in connection with any
investigation, administrative, or judicial proceeding, whether such Indemnitee
shall be designated a party thereto), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of
the Total Commitments, the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loans,
Letters of Credit or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any matter relating to or arising out of the filing or
recordation of any of the Loan Documents which filing or recordation is done
based upon information supplied by Borrower to Agent and its counsel (the
"Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, however, that Borrower shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent that such Indemnified
Liabilities are found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. Each Indemnitee will promptly notify
Borrower of each event of which it has knowledge which may give rise to a
claim under the indemnification provisions of this Section 8.2. To the extent
that the undertaking to indemnify, pay, and hold harmless set forth in the
preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or
public policy, Borrower shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and
satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities that is permissible under
applicable law. The obligations of Borrower under this Section 8.2 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the discharge of Borrower's
other obligations hereunder. 

Execution Version



Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any
amount required to be paid by it to the Agent or an Issuing Lender under
Section 8.2(a), each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agent or such
Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Pro Rata Share (determined
as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment
is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or
indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may
be, was incurred by or asserted against the Agent or such Issuing Lender in
its capacity as such.

Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any
Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential
or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of,
in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, no Indemnitee referred to in
subsection (a) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by
unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to
such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications,
electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final
and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.





ASSIGNMENT AND PARTICIPATIONS

Assignments and Participations

.

With the consent of Administrative Entity (which consent of Administrative
Entity shall not be (x) required for an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate
of a Lender, or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or (y)
other than with respect to Direct Competitors, unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), any Lender may assign and delegate to one or more
assignees (each an "Assignee") that are Eligible Transferees all, or any
ratable part of all, of the Obligations, the Revolver Commitments, the Loans
and the other rights and obligations of such Lender hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 (or the remaining
amount of any Lender's Revolver Commitment or amount of Loans, if less);
provided, however, that Borrower and Agent may continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with the interest so assigned to an
Assignee until (i) written notice of such assignment, together with payment
instructions, addresses, and related information including any documentation
required pursuant to Section 2.23(e), (f) and (g) with respect to the
Assignee, 

Execution Version



have been given to Administrative Entity and Agent by such Lender and the
Assignee, (ii) such Lender and its Assignee have delivered to Administrative
Entity and Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, fully executed and delivered by
each party thereto, and (iii) the assigning Lender or Assignee has paid to
Agent for Agent's separate account a processing fee in the amount of $3,500.
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the payment of any
fees shall not be required and the Assignee need not be an Eligible Transferee
and the consent of Administrative Entity shall not be required if such
assignment is in connection with any merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, or
other disposition of all or any substantial portion of the business or loan
portfolio of the assigning Lender.

From and after the date that Agent notifies the assigning Lender (with a copy
to Borrower) that it has received an executed Assignment and Acceptance
satisfying clause (a) above and payment of the above-referenced processing
fee, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to
such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a
Lender under the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assigning Lender shall, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights (except with respect to Section 8.2 hereof) and be
released from any future obligations under this Agreement (and in the case of
an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto and thereto), and
such assignment shall effect a novation between Borrower and the Assignee;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall release any assigning
Lender from obligations that survive the termination of this Agreement,
including such assigning Lender's obligations under Section 8.2(b) of this
Agreement relating to any period prior to the effectiveness of such
assignment.

Immediately upon Agent's receipt of the required processing fee payment and
the fully executed Assignment and Acceptance satisfying clause (a) above, this
Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent,
necessary to reflect the addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment
of the Revolver Commitments or the Loans arising therefrom. The Revolver
Commitment and the Loans allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Revolver
Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender pro tanto.

Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks, financial
institutions, or other Persons not Affiliates of such Lender and who are not
Direct Competitors (a "Participant") participating interests in its
Obligations, its Loans, the Revolver Commitment, and the other rights and
interests of that Lender (the "Originating Lender") hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents; provided, however, that (i) the Originating Lender shall
remain a "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and the Participant receiving the participating interest in the
Obligations, the Loans, the Revolver Commitments, and the other rights and
interests of the Originating Lender hereunder shall not constitute a "Lender"
hereunder or under the other Loan 

Execution Version



Documents and the Originating Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, (ii) the Originating Lender shall remain solely responsible
for the performance of such obligations, (iii) Borrower, Agent, and the
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Originating Lender
in connection with the Originating Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant
any participating interest under which the Participant has the right to
approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, except to the extent such amendment to,
or consent or waiver with respect to this Agreement or of any other Loan
Document would (A) extend the final maturity date of the Obligations hereunder
in which such Participant is participating, (B) reduce the interest rate
applicable to the Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is
participating, (C) release all or substantially all of the guaranties (except
to the extent expressly provided herein or in any of the Loan Documents)
supporting the Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is
participating, (D) postpone the payment of, or reduce the amount of, the
interest or fees payable to such Participant through such Lender, or (E)
change the amount or due dates of scheduled principal repayments or
prepayments or premiums, and (v) all amounts payable by Borrower hereunder
shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation, except
that, if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall
have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set
off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this
Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest
were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement. The rights of any
Participant only shall be derivative through the Originating Lender with whom
such Participant participates and no Participant shall have any rights under
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any direct rights as to the
other Lenders, Agent, Borrower, its Subsidiaries, or otherwise in respect of
the Obligations. No Participant shall have the right to participate directly
in the making of decisions by the Lenders among themselves. Each Originating
Lender shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the
Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each
Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participant's interest in the Revolver Commitments or other obligations under
the Loan Documents (the "Participant Register"); provided that no Lender shall
have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register
(including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a
Participant\'s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations
under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such
disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United
States Treasury Regulations.

In connection with any such assignment or participation or proposed assignment
or participation, a Lender may, subject to the provisions of Section 11.11,
disclose all documents and information which it now or hereafter may have
relating to Borrower and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses.

Any other provision in this Agreement notwithstanding, any Lender may at any
time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its
rights under 

Execution Version



and interest in this Agreement in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in
accordance with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Bank or U.S. Treasury
Regulation 31 CFR §203.24 or any other central bank having jurisdiction over
such Lender, and such Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank may enforce
such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under applicable law.

Successors

. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective
successors and assigns of each of the parties; provided, however, that
Borrower may not assign this Agreement or any rights or duties hereunder
without the Lenders' prior written consent and any prohibited assignment shall
be absolutely void ab initio. No consent to assignment by the Lenders shall
release Borrower from its Obligations. A Lender may assign this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and its rights and duties hereunder and thereunder
pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof and, except as expressly required pursuant to
Section 9.1 hereof, no consent or approval by Borrower is required in
connection with any such assignment.





AGENT; THE LENDER GROUP

Appointment and Authorization of Agent

. Each of the Lenders and each of the Issuing Lenders hereby irrevocably
appoints Agent as its agent and authorizes the Agent to take such actions on
its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the
terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto.

The bank serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers
in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not
the Agent hereunder.

The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set
forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Agent
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of
whether an Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, (b) the Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary
action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and
powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Agent is required to exercise in
writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 11.2), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the
Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the
failure to disclose, any information relating to the 

Execution Version



Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the
bank serving as Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Agent
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent
or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage
of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
Section 11.2) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Unmatured
Event of Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof

statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this
Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document
delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions
set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document,
or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere
herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be
delivered to the Agent.

The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability
for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement,
instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any
statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by
the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The
Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower),
independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be
liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice
of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

The Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and
powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent. The
Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise
its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The
exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such
sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent, and
shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication
of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in
this paragraph, the Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the
Issuing Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required
Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed (or if an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, in consultation with the Borrower), to appoint a successor. If
no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives
notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a
bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.
Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent 

Execution Version



hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and
the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the
same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
Borrower and such successor. After the Agent's resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Article X and Sections 8.1 and 8.2 shall continue in effect
for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub‑agents and their respective
Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any
of them while it was acting as Agent.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently
and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and informa-tion as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or
based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

[Reserved].

Reports and Information

. By becoming a party to this Agreement, each Lender:

is deemed to have requested that Agent furnish such Lender, promptly after it
becomes available, a copy of each document delivered to Agent pursuant to
Sections 5.2(a), (b), (c), (d) and (f)(i) (each a "Report" and collectively,
"Reports"), and Agent shall so furnish each Lender with such Reports,

expressly agrees and acknowledges that Agent does not (i) make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any Report, and (ii) shall
not be liable for any information contained in any Report, and

agrees to keep all Reports and other material, non-public information
regarding PTP and its Subsidiaries and their operations, assets, and existing
and contemplated business plans in a confidential manner in accordance with
Section 11.11.

In addition to the foregoing: (x) any Lender may from time to time request of
Agent in writing that Agent provide to such Lender a copy of any report or
document provided by Borrower to Agent that has not been contemporaneously
provided by Borrower to such Lender, and, upon receipt of such request, Agent
promptly shall provide a copy of same to such Lender, and (y) to the extent
that Agent is entitled, under any provision of the Loan Documents, to request
additional reports or information from Borrower, any Lender may, from time to
time, reasonably request Agent to exercise such right as specified in such
Lender's notice to Agent, whereupon Agent promptly shall request of Borrower
the 

Execution Version



additional reports or information reasonably specified by such Lender, and,
upon receipt thereof from Borrower, Agent promptly shall provide a copy of
same to such Lender.

Set Off; Sharing of Payments

.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and
each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any
time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate
to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the
obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement
held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have
made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be
unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender
may have.

If, at any time or times any Lender shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure,
setoff, or otherwise, any payments with respect to the Obligations, except for
any such proceeds or payments received by such Lender from Agent pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) payments from Agent in excess of such
Lender's ratable portion of all such distributions by Agent, such Lender
promptly shall (1) turn the same over to Agent, in kind, and with such
endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to Agent, or in
immediately available funds, as applicable, for the account of all of the
Lenders and for application to the Obligations in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement, or (2) purchase, without recourse or
warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the Obligations owed to
the other Lenders so that such excess payment received shall be applied
ratably as among the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares;
provided, however, that to the extent that such excess payment received by the
purchasing party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases of
participations shall be rescinded in whole or in part, as applicable, and the
applicable portion of the purchase price paid therefor shall be returned to
such purchasing party, but without interest except to the extent that such
purchasing party is required to pay interest in connection with the recovery
of the excess payment.

Payments by Agent to the Lenders

. All payments to be made by Agent to the Lenders shall be made by bank wire
transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to such wire transfer
instructions as each party may designate for itself by written notice to
Agent. Concurrently with each such payment, Agent shall identify whether such
payment (or any portion thereof) represents principal, premium, fees, or
interest of the Obligations.

Several Obligations; No Liability 

Execution Version



. Notwithstanding that certain of the Loan Documents now or hereafter may have
been or will be executed only by or in favor of Agent in its capacity as such,
and not by or in favor of the Lenders, any and all obligations on the part of
Agent (if any) to make any credit available hereunder shall constitute the
several (and not joint) obligations of the respective Lenders on a ratable
basis, according to their respective Revolver Commitments, to make an amount
of such credit not to exceed, in principal amount, at any one time
outstanding, the amount of their respective Revolver Commitments. Nothing
contained herein shall confer upon any Lender any interest in, or subject any
Lender to any liability for, or in respect of, the business, assets, profits,
losses, or liabilities of any other Lender. Each Lender shall be solely
responsible for notifying its Participants of any matters relating to the Loan
Documents to the extent any such notice may be required, and no Lender shall
have any obligation, duty, or liability to any Participant of any other
Lender. No member of the Lender Group shall have any liability for the acts of
any other member of the Lender Group. No Lender shall be responsible to
Borrower or any other Person for any failure by any other Lender to fulfill
its obligations to make credit available hereunder, nor to advance for it or
on its behalf in connection with its Revolver Commitment, nor to take any
other action on its behalf hereunder or in connection with the financing
contemplated herein.





MISCELLANEOUS

No Waivers, Remedies

. No failure or delay on the part of Agent or any Lender, or the holder of any
interest in this Agreement in exercising any right, power, privilege, or
remedy under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall impair or
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right, power, privilege, or remedy preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, privilege, or remedy. The
waiver of any such right, power, privilege, or remedy with respect to
particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed to be a waiver with
respect to other facts and circumstances. The remedies provided for under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of
any remedies that may be available to Agent or any Lender, or the holder of
any interest in this Agreement at law, in equity, or otherwise.

Waivers and Amendments

. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (other than an
amendment pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.18) or any other Loan
Document (other than any Fee Letter), and no consent with respect to any
departure by Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the Required Lenders (or by Agent at the written
request of the Required Lenders) and Borrower and then any such waiver or
consent shall be effective, but only in the specific instance and for the 

Execution Version



specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such waiver,
amendment, or consent shall:

increase or extend any Revolver Commitment of any Lender without the written
consent of such Lender; provided that no amendment, modification or waiver of
any condition precedent, covenant, Event of Default or Unmatured Event of
Default shall constitute an increase in any Revolver Commitment of any Lender,

postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document
for any payment of principal, interest, fees, or other amounts due hereunder
or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender
adversely affected thereby,

reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest on, any loan or other
extension of credit hereunder, or reduce any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each
Lender adversely affected thereby,

change "Pro Rata Share" or Sections 2.3 or 10.4 in a manner that would alter
the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent
of each Lender adversely affected thereby,

amend or modify this Section or any provision of this Agreement providing for
consent or other action by all Lenders without the written consent of each
Lender,

change the definition of "Required Lenders" without the written consent of
each Lender, or

other than as permitted by Article XII, release any Loan Party from any
obligation for the payment of money without the written consent of each
Lender, and

provided further, however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless
in writing and signed by Agent or the respective Issuing Lender, as
applicable, affect the rights or duties of Agent or such Issuing Lender, as
applicable, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. The foregoing
notwithstanding, any amendment, modification, waiver, consent, termination, or
release of, or with respect to, any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document that relates only to the relationship of the Lender Group among
themselves, and that does not affect the rights or obligations of Borrower,
shall not require consent by or the agreement of Borrower. The foregoing to
the contrary notwithstanding, an amendment to this Agreement to effectuate an
Approved Increase shall only require the consent of Borrower, the Agent and
the new Lender and shall not require the consent of any other Lender.

If any action to be taken by the Lender Group or Agent hereunder requires the
greater than majority or unanimous consent, authorization, or agreement of all
Lenders, 

Execution Version



and a Lender ("Holdout Lender") fails to give its consent, authorization, or
agreement or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender hereunder, then Agent or, if
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower, upon at least 5
Business Days' prior irrevocable notice to the Holdout Lender or Defaulting
Lender, may permanently replace the Holdout Lender or Defaulting Lender with
one or more substitute Lenders (each, a "Replacement Lender"), and the Holdout
Lender or Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced
hereunder. Such notice to replace the Holdout Lender or Defaulting Lender
shall specify an effective date for such replacement, which date shall not be
later than 15 Business Days after the date such notice is given. Prior to the
effective date of such replacement, the Holdout Lender or Defaulting Lender,
as applicable, and each Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an
Assignment and Acceptance, subject only to the Holdout Lender or such
Defaulting Lender being repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations
(including an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of any participation in any
Letter of Credit Usage) without any premium or penalty of any kind whatsoever.
If the Holdout Lender or Defaulting Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and
deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of such
replacement, the Holdout Lender or Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have
executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance. The replacement of any
Holdout Lender or Defaulting Lender shall be made in accordance with the terms
of Section 9.1. Until such time as the Replacement Lenders shall have acquired
all of the Obligations, the Revolver Commitments, and the other rights and
obligations of the Holdout Lender or Defaulting Lender hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, the Holdout Lender or Defaulting Lender, as applicable,
shall remain obligated to make its Pro Rata Share of Loans and to purchase a
participation in each Letter of Credit, in accordance with this Agreement.

assignment or transfer shall be absolutely void.

different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and
delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic method
of transmission shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original
executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an executed
counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic method of

Agreement but the failure to deliver an original executed counterpart shall
not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of this Agreement.

HERETO TO WAIVER OF ITS OR THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Independence of Covenants

. All covenants under this Agreement and other Loan Documents shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not
permitted by any one covenant, the fact that it would be permitted by another
covenant, shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event of Default or Unmatured
Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists.

. Agent and Lenders each individually (and not jointly or jointly and
severally) agree that material, non-public information regarding PTP, the Loan
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, their operations, assets, and

only in connection with this Agreement and in compliance with applicable laws,
including United States federal or state securities laws, and shall not be
disclosed by Agent and the Lenders to Persons who are not parties to this
Agreement, except: (a) to attorneys for and other advisors, accountants,
auditors, and consultants to any member of the Lender Group, (b) to
Subsidiaries and Affiliates of any member of the Lender Group and any of their

nature of such information and instructed to keep such information
confidential, (c) as may be required by statute, decision, or judicial or
administrative order, rule, regulation or any Governmental Authority (other
than any state, federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating banks or
banking); provided that, to the extent it may lawfully do so, Agent or any
such Lender shall notify Borrower of such requirement prior to any disclosure
of such information to a party that Agent or such Lender reasonably believes
may not keep such information confidential and shall reasonably cooperate with
Borrower in any lawful effort by Borrower to prevent or limit such disclosure
or otherwise protect the confidentiality of such information, (d) as may be

prevent or limit such disclosure or otherwise protect the confidentiality of
such information, (e) as requested or required by any state, federal or

Affiliates to be from a confidential source and information that is provided

Execution Version



Complete Agreement

. This Agreement, together with the exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Statement,
and the other Loan Documents is intended by the parties hereto as a final
expression of their agreement and is intended as a complete statement of the
terms and conditions of their agreement with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and shall not be contradicted or qualified by any other
agreement, oral or written, before the Restatement Effective Date.

USA Patriot Act Notice

. Each Lender hereby notifies the Loan Parties that pursuant to the
requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56) signed into
law October 26, 2001 (the "USA Patriot Act"), it may be required to obtain,
verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which
information includes the name and address of such Loan Party and other
information that will allow such Lender to identify such Loan Party in
accordance with the USA Patriot Act.

No Novation

. Borrower, the Lenders and Agent hereby agree that this Agreement amends and
restates the Existing Credit Agreement in its entirety (and therefore, this
Agreement shall not constitute or effectuate a novation thereof) and all
Loans, Letters of Credit and other Obligations of the Loan Parties outstanding
under the Existing Credit Agreement as of the Closing Date shall be deemed to
be Loans, Letters of Credit and Obligations outstanding under this Agreement
(and the Borrower and each Guarantor hereby assume all such Obligations)
without further action by any Person except as otherwise expressly modified by
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The rights and duties of Ares and
AIH (as predecessors in interest to the Borrower), Agent, and the Lenders with
respect to all matters relating to time periods prior to the Restatement
Effective Date shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the
Existing Credit Agreement, and the rights and duties of Borrower, Agent, and
the Lenders with respect to all matters relating to time periods from and
after the Restatement Effective Date shall be determined in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents. This Agreement does
not extinguish the obligations for the payment of money outstanding under the
Existing Credit Agreement (including without limitation, Section 12.8) or
discharge or release the obligations or the liens or priority of any mortgage,
pledge, security agreement or any other security therefor. Nothing herein
contained shall be construed as a substitution or novation of the obligations
outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement or instruments securing the
same, which shall remain in full force and effect, except as modified hereby
(including without limitation, Section 12.8) or by instruments executed
concurrently herewith. Except as expressly set forth herein (including without
limitation, Section 12.8), nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a
release or other discharge of any Loan Party from any of their obligations or
liabilities under the Existing Credit Agreement.

Judgment Currency 

Execution Version



. This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of
Dollars or any Alternative Currency, as the case may be (the "Specified
Currency"), and payment in New York City or the country of the Specified
Currency, as the case may be (the "Specified Place"), is of the essence, and
the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating
to Loans or reimbursement obligations denominated in the Specified Currency.
The payment obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement shall not be
discharged or satisfied by an amount paid in another currency or in another
place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the
amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the
Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of
the Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder. If for the
purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum
due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the "Second
Currency"), the rate of exchange that shall be applied shall be the rate at
which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase
the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next
preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of the
Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Agent or any Lender
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (in this Section called an
"Entitled Person") shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually
applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on
the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged
to be due hereunder in the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in
accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the
Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency
so adjudged to be due; and the Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person
against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in the Specified Currency,
the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due to such Entitled Person in
the Specified Currency hereunder exceeds the amount of the Specified Currency
so purchased and transferred.

Ares Holdings as Agent for Each Entity Comprising the Borrower

. Each of the entities comprising the Borrower hereby appoints Ares Holdings
as its agent, attorney-in-fact and representative (the "Administrative
Entity") for the purpose of (i) making any borrowing requests or other
requests required under this Agreement, (ii) the giving and receipt of notices
by and to Borrower under this Agreement, (iii) the delivery of all documents,
reports, financial statements and written materials required to be delivered
by Borrower under this Agreement, and (iv) all other purposes incidental to
any of the foregoing. Each entity comprising Borrower agrees that any action
taken by Ares Holdings as Administrative Entity shall be binding upon such
entity to the same extent as if directly taken by such entity. Each of the
entities comprising the Borrower hereby jointly and severally hereby
indemnifies the Indemnitees and holds the Indemnitees harmless as set forth in
Section 8.2 hereof.

No Fiduciary Duties 

Execution Version



. Each of the Loan Parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Agent, the
Issuing Lenders and the Lenders may have economic interests that conflict with
those of the Loan Parties and/or their Affiliates and nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document creates any fiduciary relationship with
or duty to such Loan Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Agent,
the Issuing Lenders and Lenders, on the one hand, and such Loan Party, on the
other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of creditor and
debtor.

Acknowledgment and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any
other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each
party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution
arising under any Loan Document may be subject to the write-down and
conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to,
and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA
Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be
payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and



(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if
applicable:



(i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;

(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other
instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent entity,
or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it,
and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it
in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document; or

(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the
exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution
Authority.





GUARANTY

Guaranty of Payment

. Subject to Section 12.7, each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably and jointly and severally guarantees to the Agent, for the benefit
of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, the prompt payment of the Obligations
in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by
acceleration or otherwise). Any payment 

Execution Version



hereunder shall be made at such place and in the same currency as such
relevant Obligation is payable. This guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not
solely of collection and is a continuing guaranty and shall apply to all
Obligations whenever arising.

Obligations Unconditional.

(a) Guarantee Absolute. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article
XII are primary, absolute and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective
of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the
obligations of the Loan Parties under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents
or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any
substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for
any of the Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor
other than payment in full of the Obligations, it being the intent of this
Section 12.2 that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be
absolute and unconditional, joint and several, under any and all circumstances
and shall apply to any and all Obligations now existing or in the future
arising. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that
the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not affect the
enforceability of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or affect,
limit, reduce, discharge, terminate, alter or impair the liability of the
Guarantors hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as
described above:

at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Guarantors, the time
for any performance of or compliance with any of the Obligations shall be
extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;

any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein
or therein shall be done or omitted;

the maturity of any of the Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the
Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any
right under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or
instrument referred to herein or therein shall be waived or any other
guarantee of any of the Obligations or any security therefor shall be released
or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

any application by any member of the Lender Group of the proceeds of any other
guaranty of or insurance for any of the Obligations to the payment of any of
the Obligations;

any settlement, compromise, release, liquidation or enforcement by any member
of the Lender Group of any of the Obligations; 

Execution Version



the giving by any member of the Lender Group of any consent to the merger or
consolidation of, the sale of substantial assets by, or other restructuring or
termination of the corporate existence of, the Borrower or any other Person,
or to any disposition of any Securities by the Borrower or any other Person;

the exercise by any member of the Lender Group of any of their rights,
remedies, powers and privileges under the Loan Documents;

the entering into any other transaction or business dealings with the Borrower
or any other Person; or

any combination of the foregoing.

Waiver of Defenses. The enforceability of this Agreement and the liability of
the Guarantors and the rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the Lender
Group under this Agreement shall not be affected, limited, reduced, discharged
or terminated, and each Guarantor hereby expressly waives to the fullest
extent permitted by law any defense now or in the future arising, by reason
of:

the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any
Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument whatsoever relating to any
of the Obligations;

any disability or other defense with respect to any of the Obligations,
including the effect of any statute of limitations, that may bar the
enforcement thereof or the obligations of such Guarantor relating thereto;

the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any other guaranty of or
insurance for any of the Obligations;

the cessation, for any cause whatsoever, of the liability of the Borrower or
any Guarantor with respect to any of the Obligations;

any failure of any member of the Lender Group to marshal assets, to pursue or
exhaust any right, remedy, power or privilege it may have against the
Borrowers or any other Person, or to take any action whatsoever to mitigate or
reduce the liability of any Guarantor under this Agreement, the Lender Group
being under no obligation to take any such action notwithstanding the fact
that any of the Obligations may be due and payable and that the Borrower may
be in default of its obligations under any Loan Document;

any counterclaim, set-off or other claim which the Borrower or any Guarantor
has or claims with respect to any of the Obligations;

any failure of any member of the Lender Group to file or enforce a claim in
any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other proceeding with respect to
any Person; 

Execution Version



any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, winding-up or adjustment of debts,
or appointment of a custodian, liquidator or the like of it, or similar
proceedings commenced by or against the Borrower or any other Person,
including any discharge of, or bar, stay or injunction against collecting, any
of the Obligations (or any interest on any of the Obligations) in or as a
result of any such proceeding;

any action taken by any member of the Lender Group that is authorized by this
Section or otherwise in this Agreement or by any other provision of any Loan
Document, or any omission to take any such action; or

any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor other than payment in
full of the Obligations.

Waiver of Counterclaim. The Guarantors expressly waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, for the benefit of the Lender Group, any right of set-off
and counterclaim with respect to payment of its obligations hereunder, and all
diligence, presentment, demand of payment or performance, protest, notice of
nonpayment or nonperformance, notice of protest, notice of dishonor and all
other notices or demands whatsoever, and any requirement that any member of
the Lender Group exhaust any right, power, privilege or remedy or proceed
against the Loan Parties under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any
other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or against any
other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the
Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Agreement or of the
existence, creation, incurrence or assumption of new or additional
Obligations. Each Guarantor further expressly waives the benefit of any and
all statutes of limitation, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Other Waivers. Each Guarantor expressly waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, for the benefit of the Lender Group, any right to which it
may be entitled:

that the assets of the Borrower first be used, depleted and/or applied in
satisfaction of the Obligations prior to any amounts being claimed from or
paid by such Guarantor;

to require that the Borrower be sued and all claims against the Borrower be
completed prior to an action or proceeding being initiated against such
Guarantor; and

to have its obligations hereunder be divided among the Guarantors, such that
each Guarantor's obligation would be less than the full amount claimed.

Modifications

. Each Guarantor agrees to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law that
(a) all or any part of any security which hereafter may be held for the
Obligations, if 

Execution Version



any, may be exchanged, compromised or surrendered from time to time; (b) the
Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders shall not have any obligation to
protect, perfect, secure or insure any such security interests or Liens which
hereafter may be held, if any, for the Obligations or the properties subject
thereto; (c) the time or place of payment of the Obligations may be changed or
extended, in whole or in part, to a time certain or otherwise, and may be
renewed or accelerated, in whole or in part; (d) the Borrower and any other
party liable for payment under this Agreement may be granted indulgences
generally; (e) any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document may be modified, amended or waived; (f) any party liable for the
payment thereof may be granted indulgences or be released; and (g) any deposit
balance for the credit of the Borrower or any other party liable for the
payment of the Obligations or liable upon any security therefor may be
released, in whole or in part, at, before or after the stated, extended or
accelerated maturity of the Obligations, all without notice to or further
assent by such Guarantor, which shall remain bound thereon, notwithstanding
any such exchange, compromise, surrender, extension, renewal, acceleration,
modification, indulgence or release.

Waiver of Rights

. Each Guarantor expressly waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law: (a) notice of acceptance of this guaranty by the Agent, the
Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, and of all Loans made to the Borrower by the
Lenders and Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lenders; (b) presentment
and demand for payment or performance of any of the Obligations; (c) protest
and notice of dishonor or of default (except as specifically required in this
Agreement) with respect to the Obligations or with respect to any security
therefor; (d) notice of the Lenders obtaining, amending, substituting for,
releasing, waiving or modifying any Lien, if any, hereafter securing the
Obligations, or the Agent's, Lenders' or Issuing Lenders' subordinating,
compromising, discharging or releasing such Liens, if any; (e) all other
notices to which the Borrower might otherwise be entitled in connection with
the guaranty evidenced by this Section 12.4; and (f) demand for payment under
this guaranty.

Reinstatement

. The obligations of each Guarantor under this Section 12.5 shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment
by or on behalf of any person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or
must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as
a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and
each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Lenders on demand for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Agent, Lenders and Issuing Lenders in
connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and
expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment
constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

Remedies 

Execution Version



. Each Guarantor agrees to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Agent, Lenders and
Issuing Lenders, on the other hand, the Obligations may be declared to be
forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VII (and shall be deemed to
have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in
Article VII) notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition
preventing such declaration (or preventing such Obligations from becoming
automatically due and payable) as against any other person and that, in the
event of such declaration (or such Obligations being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable), such Obligations (whether or not due and
payable by any other person) shall forthwith become due and payable by such
Guarantor.

Limitation of Guaranty

. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, to the
extent the obligations of a Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any
applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or
transfers) then the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall be limited
to the maximum amount that is permissible under applicable law (whether
federal or state and including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code).
Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document, the partners of
the Loan Parties shall not be personally liable under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document.

Termination of Existing Guarantee

. As and effective from the Restatement Effective Date, the obligations of the
Guarantors (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) under the Guaranty
(as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) shall be terminated and of no
further force or effect.
