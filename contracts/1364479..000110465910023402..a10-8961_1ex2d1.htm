further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder
of any of the following securities:

  

### 

  

##### (i) subject to _Section 2.02(e)_, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
2.01(a)(ii)_) shall be converted into the right to receive:

  

##### 

  

(A) 0.6366 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("

Amount (the " _Cash Consideration_ ," and together with the Stock
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  



  

##### (ii) each share of Company Common Stock that immediately prior to the
Effective Time is owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company (as treasury stock
or otherwise) or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be canceled
without any consideration being exchanged therefor; and

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger

lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock), into which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall have

  



        
   

  



  

### been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.01_ and _Section 2.02(e)_,
as well as any dividends to which holders of Company Common Stock have become
entitled in accordance with _Section 2.02(c)_.

  

### 

  

### (c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number
or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split or other similar change in capitalization (but excluding any
change that results from (i) the exercise of stock options or the conversion
into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock of other equity awards
relating to the Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock or (ii) the grant
of stock-based compensation to directors or employees of Parent or
(other than any such grants not made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement) the Company or their respective Subsidiaries under Parents or the
Companys, as applicable, stock option or compensation plans or
arrangements), the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted to reflect such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar change in capitalization.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Exchange Agent_.  At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, on behalf of Merger Sub, with a bank
or trust company designated by Parent with the Companys prior consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock for
exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ through the Exchange Agent:
(i) certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
that is sufficient to deliver, and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent
to timely deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration; (ii) immediately
available funds sufficient to pay, and Parent shall instruct the Exchange
Agent to timely pay, the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the
extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_) and (iii) from time to
time as needed, additional cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to  _Section 2.02(e)_ and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_ (such shares of Parent
Common Stock and aggregate Cash Consideration, together with any dividends or
other distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the
Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_ and any cash payments in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.02(e)_, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_.  As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event within five business days thereafter, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of
Company Common

  



        
   

  



  

### Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_: (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall
have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may agree) and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for certificates or book-
entries representing shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Stock
Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration and cash comprising the
Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions to which holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.02(e)_. Upon surrender of a Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and/or such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Book-Entry
Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a
certificate or book-entry representing that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ after taking into account all the shares of
Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all such Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates so surrendered and (B) a check for the cash that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_, including (1) the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger
Consideration, (2) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_ and (3) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_, and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, (x) a certificate or book-
entry representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
comprising the Stock Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration and
(y) a check for the proper amount of cash (1) comprising the Cash
Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, (2) comprising any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.02(c)_ and (3) in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_, shall
be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if, upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. The shares of Parent Common Stock
constituting the Stock Consideration, at Parents option, shall be
in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested
by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or is

  



        
   

  



  

### otherwise required under applicable Law. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.02(b)_, each Book-Entry Share
and Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender, the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of
such Certificate is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_ and cash in lieu
of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_.  No interest will be paid or will
accrue for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock on the
Merger Consideration or on any other cash payable to holders of Company
Common Stock pursuant to this _Article II_.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Book-Entry Share or Certificate with respect to any shares of Parent Common
Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_,
in each case, until the holder of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall
surrender such Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with this
_Article II_. Following surrender of any Book-Entry Share or Certificate,
there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) at the time
of such surrender, in addition to all other amounts to which such holder is
entitled under this _Article II_, the amount of dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and paid with respect to
Parent Common Stock prior to such surrender and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ (including any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant
to _Section 2.02(c)_ and cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant
to _Section 2.02(e)_) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates, and at the
close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity
of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of _Section
2.02(f)_, if, at any time after the Effective Time, Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_.

  



         
 

  



  

### (e) _No Fractional Shares_.  No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates, no dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share and no such fractional share will entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of
the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A)
the fractional share interest to which such former holder (after taking
into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by
such holder and rounded to the nearest ten thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the per share closing price
of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date (or, if such date is not a trading
day, the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date) on the New York
Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") (such price described in this clause (B), the "
_Parent Trading Price_ ").

  

### 

  

### (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock on the date
that is twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand. Any holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this
_Article II_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares
of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto) or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or
cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock
five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior
to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claim or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
_provided_ , that (i) no such investment gains or losses thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement, (ii) following any losses in the Exchange Fund, Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent
such losses result in the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund being less than
the amounts that remain payable to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock under this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be in

  



        
   

  



  

### (A) short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America with maturities of no more than 30 days, (B) in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Financial Services LLC, respectively or (C) short-term
certificates of deposit with maturities of no more than thirty days or
overnight bank repurchase agreements, in each case, of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $5 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available). The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Lost Certificates_.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
requested by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent may reasonably request as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent with respect to such Certificate, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the
holder of such Certificate would be entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_
and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder would be entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_, in each case in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Withholding_.  The Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options or stock-based awards such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of the Company Common
Stock, Company Options or stock-based awards in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 2.03 _Dissenters  Rights_.  Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock that are
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a
stockholder who has properly exercised such stockholders appraisal rights in
respect of such shares (any such shares being referred to herein as "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01_
and instead shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of
the DGCL (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to timely
perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholders
right to dissent from the

  



        
   

  



  

## Merger under the DGCL) and to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and
subject to the requirements of the DGCL. The Company shall (i) give Parent
prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of
Company Common Stock or any withdrawals of such demands received by the
Company and (ii) give Parent the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands and not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate any such
demands.

## SECTION 2.04 _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

  

## 

  

### (a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted to employees or directors of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under any Company Benefit Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company
Options_ ") shall be converted into an option (an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to
purchase, on the same terms and conditions as applied to each such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (taking into account any
accelerated vesting of such Company Options in accordance with the terms
thereof), the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Incentive
Award Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each such share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by the Incentive Award Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Incentive Award Exchange Ratio_ " shall be the sum of (x)
plus (y), where (x) is the Exchange Ratio and (y) is the quotient of (i)(A)
the Cash Consideration plus (B) the Special Dividend Per Share Amount divided
by (ii) the Parent Trading Price.

  

### 

  

### (b) With respect to each grant of performance or performance unit share
awards outstanding as of the Effective Time (each, a " _Performance Share
Award_ "), the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in lieu of such
Performance Share Award from Parent and Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
to the holder thereof, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time and in any event within ten days thereafter, a lump sum
cash payment equal to (x)(i) the Merger Consideration (valuing the
stock portion of the Merger Consideration at the Parent Trading Price) plus
(ii) the Special Dividend Per Share Amount multiplied by (y) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that would be delivered to the holder under
such Performance Share Award if performance was achieved at the target level.

  

### 

  

### (c) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit of Company
Common Stock granted to any employee or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under a Company Benefit Plan that is outstanding immediately
prior to the

  



        
   

  



  

### Effective Time other than the Performance Share Awards (collectively, the
" _Company Restricted Stock Units_ ," and together with the Company Options
and the Performance Share Awards, each, a " _Company Incentive Award_ ")
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, immediately accelerate and vest, be cancelled and converted
into the right of the holder thereof to receive from Parent, and Parent shall
pay or cause to be paid to each such holder of Company Restricted Stock
Units, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and in
any event within ten days thereafter, a lump sum cash payment equal to (x)(i)
the Merger Consideration (valuing the stock portion of the Merger
Consideration at the Parent Trading Price) plus (ii) the Special Dividend Per
Share Amount multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
to which such holders Company Restricted Stock Units pertain.

  

### 

  

### (d) All account balances outstanding as of the Effective Time under the
Companys Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan, Retirement Plan,
2009 Deferred Compensation Plan, Deferred Compensation Plan  Management 2010
and any individual deferral agreements with executive officers and directors
(collectively, the " _Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") will be paid out in
cash to participants therein by the Company at the Effective Time, or as soon
as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than five days after the
Effective Time) by the Surviving Entity, less any required withholding taxes.

  

### 

  

### (e) Parent shall take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to
have available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Adjusted Options.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parents
obligations under this _Section 2.04_.

  

### 

  

### (f) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall each take
all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of
shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
" _Exchange Act_ "), including any such actions specified in the No-Action
Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom, LLP.

on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to another
Section of this Agreement, _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item in

reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

## SECTION 3.01 _Corporate Organization_.  The Company and each of its

## SECTION 3.05 _Company SEC Reports; Financial Statements; No Undisclosed
Liabilities; Internal Controls_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Since January 1, 2008, the Company has timely filed all forms,
reports and documents required to be filed by it with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), all of which have complied as of their
respective filing dates or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing
prior to the date hereof, the date of the last such amendment or superseding
filing, in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ ") and the Exchange Act. None of the
forms, reports or documents filed by the Company with the SEC since such date
(the " _Company SEC Reports_ "), or that will be filed with the SEC after the
date hereof, including any financial statements or schedules included or
incorporated by reference therein, at the time filed (and, in the case of a
registration statement, as of its effective date) or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of
the last such amendment or superseding filing, contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

### 

  

### (b) The financial statements of the Company included or incorporated by
reference in the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of
the respective dates therein set forth (subject, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments), (iii) complied
as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all
material respects with published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied
during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such
statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been and are being maintained in all material respects
in accordance with GAAP.

  

### 

  

### (c) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or
obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, known or
unknown, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that is
required to be set forth on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP,
except for those liabilities and obligations: (i) that are reflected or
reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance sheet dated as of
December 31, 2009 included in the Company SEC Reports, including any notes
thereto, (ii) arising out of this Agreement and (iii) incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December
31, 2009, which

  



        
   

  



  

### would not be prohibited by this Agreement and that have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Company has designed a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and such system is effective at the reasonable assurance level. The
Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed
to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries is made known to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and such
controls and procedures are effective in ensuring such disclosures and
communications, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Companys Board of Directors (and made summaries of such
disclosures available to Parent): (x) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
substantially addressed any such deficiency, material weakness or fraud. As
of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that the Companys outside
auditors, chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be
able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when required.

  

### 

  

### (e) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and each

### (d) Parent has designed a system of internal control over financial

Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.01_, and except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to and
shall not authorize or permit its and their respective directors, officers,

### any event, not in contemplation of any Company Competing Proposal), any
Company Competing Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding a
Company Competing Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Competing Proposal and
promptly request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished, and the Company shall take all reasonably
necessary actions to secure its rights and ensure the performance of any such
persons obligations under any applicable confidentiality agreement to return
or destroy such information. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
enforce its rights under the provisions of any "standstill" agreement between
the Company and any person (other than Parent), and shall not grant any
waiver of, or agree to any amendment or modification to, any such agreement,
to permit such person to submit a Company Competing Proposal. The Company
shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the provisions of this
_Section 5.03_, and any violation of the restrictions contained in this
_Section 5.03_ by its Board of Directors (including any committee thereof)
or its Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
5.03_ by the Company.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.03(a)_, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if after the
date hereof the Company receives an unsolicited Company Competing Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) below would be inconsistent
with the Board of Directors fiduciary duties under Delaware Law, and such
Company Competing Proposal has not resulted from the Company breaching its
obligations under this _Section 5.03_, the Company may (i) furnish nonpublic
information to the person making such Company Competing Proposal, if, and
only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from
such person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable
to such person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii)
participate in discussions or negotiations with such person (and its
Representatives) making such Company Competing Proposal with respect to such
Company Competing Proposal; _provided_  that the Company shall give written
notice to Parent after any such determination by the Companys Board of
Directors and before taking any of the actions described in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii). The Company shall promptly notify Parent (within no
more than 48 hours) of the communication or receipt of any Company Competing
Proposal, any request for information that could reasonably be expected to be
related to a Company Competing Proposal, or any request for discussions or
negotiations that could reasonably be expected to be related to a Company
Competing Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity
of the person making such Company Competing Proposal or request and the
material terms and conditions thereof.  

  



        
   

  



  

### The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis
(within no more than 48 hours) of any material developments in the status and
terms of any such Company Competing Proposal or request (including whether
such Company Competing Proposal or request has been withdrawn or rejected and
any material change to the terms thereof) and shall concurrently provide
Parent with copies of any material written information or materials that it
provides to the person making the request therefor that have not been
previously provided to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (c) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.01_ and except as otherwise provided for in the
immediately following sentence and _Section 5.03(d)_, neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or
modify, in any manner, the Company Recommendation (a " _Company Change of
Recommendation_ "); (ii) approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve
or recommend, any Company Competing Proposal; or (iii) approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition or other agreement
relating to any Company Competing Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement permitted by _Section 5.03(b)_). Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
and other than in connection with a Company Competing Proposal (which is
addressed in _Section 5.03(d))_, the Board of Directors of the Company may
make a Company Change of Recommendation if the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys
financial and outside legal advisors that the failure of the Board of
Directors of the Company to withdraw, qualify or modify the Company
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that the Company has provided Parent two Business Days prior
written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that an unsolicited Company
Competing Proposal made after the date hereof that has not resulted from a
breach of the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.03_ constitutes a
Superior Proposal, then the Board of Directors of the Company shall provide
written notice to Parent at least two business days in advance of making or
effecting a Company Change of Recommendation (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ "). A Notice of Superior Proposal shall advise Parent that the
Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal and shall
include any information and materials required to be delivered under _Section
5.03(b)_ that have not yet been provided to Parent (including the most recent
version of any written agreement relating to the

  



        
   

  



  

### transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal or, if no such agreement
exists, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal). If Parent, within two business days following its receipt
of a Notice of Superior Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), makes an offer
that, as determined in good faith by the Companys Board of Directors, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, results
in the applicable Company Competing Proposal no longer being a Superior
Proposal, then the Company shall not make a Company Change of Recommendation
with respect to such Company Competing Proposal and shall have no right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ as a result of such
Company Competing Proposal.  If Parent shall not have made such an offer
within the Notice Period, then the Board of Directors of the Company may make
a Company Change of Recommendation with respect to the Superior Proposal to
which such Notice Period applied and/or may terminate this Agreement to
accept such Superior Proposal pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ after paying the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.02_. During the Notice
Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives, including,
without limitation, its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, to
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to any offer from Parent. Any (i)
material revisions to the terms of a Superior Proposal or (ii) material
revisions to a Company Competing Proposal that the Companys Board of
Directors had determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall
constitute a new Company Competing Proposal and shall require the Company to
deliver to Parent a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new Notice Period
shall commence thereafter. Except in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this _Section 5.03(d)_, the Company shall have no right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_.

  

### 

  

### (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the
Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable to a Company
Competing Proposal, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with any applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Board of
Directors of the Company may not effect a Company Change of
Recommendation, unless permitted to do so by _Section 5.03(c)_ and _Section
5.03(d)_;  _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any disclosure (other than a "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) made pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) shall be deemed to
be a Company Change of Recommendation, unless the Companys Board
of Directors expressly reaffirms its recommendation to the Companys
stockholders in favor of approval of the Merger and this Agreement. The
Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company
Competing Proposal or Superior Proposal prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

### (f) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Competing Proposal_ " shall
mean any inquiry, offer or proposal (from any person other than Parent or its
Subsidiaries) for (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) the direct
or indirect acquisition of assets or businesses representing 15% or more of
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether
pursuant to an acquisition of securities, assets or otherwise; or (iii) the
acquisition of 15% or more of any class of the issued and outstanding equity
or voting securities of the Company.

  

### 

  

### (g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona
fide written Company Competing Proposal ( _provided_ , that for purposes of
the definition of Superior Proposal, references to "15%" shall be deemed to
be references to "50%"), which the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account all the terms of the
Company Competing Proposal (including, without limitation, the
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such proposal, the identity of the
person making such proposal and the conditions for completion of such
proposal) (i) is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
Companys stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(taking into account any revised proposal by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 5.03(d)_) and the
failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to approve or recommend such
Company Competing Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (ii) the financing of which is fully committed or
reasonably likely to be obtained and (iii) is reasonably expected to be
consummated on a timely basis.

Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set

Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

Company Recommendation, unless there has been a Company Change of
Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.03(c)_ and _Section 5.03(d)_.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has
been terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the Company shall submit the

party, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of December 10, 2009, between Parent and
the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be
obligated to provide any such access or information to the extent that doing
so (x) may cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney
work product protection, (y) would violate a confidentiality obligation to
any Person or (z) would violate any Law applicable to it, its Subsidiaries or
its business. The disclosing party shall be entitled to have its

portions thereof.

be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and

proceeding by any Governmental Authority, prior to the Termination Date; (iv)
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the receipt thereof, respond
to (or properly reduce the scope of) any formal or informal request for
additional information or documentary material received by the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any Governmental
Authority; and (v) consult and cooperate with each other and consider in good
faith the views of each other in connection with any analyses, appearances,

proceedings before any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate with each other to the extent necessary to assist each

for any filing or submission under any Antitrust Law and (y) keep each other
reasonably informed with respect to the status of each action or nonaction,
waiver, consent or approval sought from a Governmental Authority, in each
case, in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

counsel with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other partys outside legal counsel may reasonably request in connection with
its preparation of necessary submissions of information to any such

the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that
subject to its undertakings in _Section 6.03(c)_, the final determination as
to the appropriate course of action shall be made by Parent.  The Board of
Directors of the Company shall (a) take all action reasonably necessary to

administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by
a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
the transactions provided for in this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust
Laws or that

  



        
   

  



  

### would otherwise prevent, materially impede or delay the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate and
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to as promptly as reasonably practicable vigorously

have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that restrains, enjoins, prohibits, prevents, or restricts
or would otherwise materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, to permit the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated in the most
expeditious manner practicable.

  

### 

  

### (c) For purposes of Section 6.03(a) and (b), Parents "reasonable best
efforts" shall include an obligation of Parent and its Subsidiaries to
license, franchise, divest or hold separate any business locations or
business lines of the Company, Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries (including the Advantage business locations and business line
owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries (" _Advantage_ ")), or to take any
similar measure, reasonably necessary to secure HSR Approval or CBC Approval
(a " _Divestiture Action_ "). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, "reasonable best efforts" shall not require Parent or its
Subsidiaries to license, franchise, divest or hold separate any business
locations or business lines of the Company, Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries other than (i) Advantage and (ii) in addition
to Advantage, business locations or business lines that produced aggregate
gross revenues in an amount not in excess of $175 million (" _Divested
Revenues_ ") for Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries during
the 2009 calendar year, calculated in accordance with GAAP, on a basis
consistent with the accounting principles used in preparing their respective
2009 financial statements included in the Company SEC Reports or Parent SEC
Reports, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, in calculating Divested
Revenues, only the business locations (or in the case of an entire business
line, the business locations within such business line) for which a
Divestiture Action is taken, shall be included. For example, if a Divestiture
Action is required at an airport where the Parent and the Company each have a
business location (or multiple business locations), only the business
location at such airport that is divested shall be included in the
calculation of Divested Revenues.

  

### 

  

### (d) Neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, person
or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if,
upon advice of such partys outside legal counsel, the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, (i)
would reasonably be expected to delay or to increase the likelihood of not
obtaining the applicable action, nonaction, waiver, clearance, consent or
approval under the HSR Act or applicable requirements of the

  



        
   

  



  

### Competition Act in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby prior to the Termination Date or (ii) would reasonably be
expected to require any action, nonaction, waiver, clearance, consent or
approval of any Governmental Authority not listed on Section 7.01 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

### 

  

### (e) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
consents listed on Section 6.03(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and
each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to

## 

  

### (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the
Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates) or in any agreement (a " _Company Indemnity Agreement_ "), each
as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The Company
has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all Company
Indemnity Agreements. Parent and the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Entity to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
advance expenses to Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions
by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent provided by: (i) the Company Certificate, the Company
Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates) as in effect on the date of this Agreement;
and (ii) any Company Indemnity Agreement between any such Indemnified Party
on the one hand and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the other hand.

  

### 

  

### (b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.04(a)_, from and after
the Effective Time, Parent will: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified Party from
and against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement (including, in each case, any interest or assessments
thereon) in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out
of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission
in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the

  



        
   

  



  

### Effective Time; or (B) the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions
contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay (within 30 days following any request for
advancement) the expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of any
Indemnified Party incurred in connection with any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified, in
each case, if such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
Companys or any of its Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
other similar governing documents or any applicable Company Indemnity
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties as a group
may retain only one law firm to represent them with respect to each such
matter unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more
Indemnified Parties.

  

### 

  

### (c) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Entity to provide, for a
period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Indemnified
Parties who are insured under the Companys directors and
officers insurance and indemnification policy with an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less
favorable than the existing policy of the Company; _provided_ , that Parent
and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid as of the date
hereof by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage at any time exceed such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may
and at Parents request shall, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail"
directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy, _provided_
that payment for each year of insurance coverage provided by such "tail"
directors and officers insurance policy shall not exceed 300% of the annual
premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company. Any such "tail" directors
and officers insurance and indemnification policy will satisfy Parents
obligation under this _Section 6.04(c)_ to provide DandO Insurance.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.04_ applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.04_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.04_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party
and his or her successors, heirs and representatives.

  

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this _Section
6.04_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be
binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the

to duplicate any benefits payable to the Covered Employee with respect to the
same period of service, and (ii) with respect to any health, dental or vision

Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee commences to participate, in the
plan year that includes the year in which such Covered Employee commences to
participate, (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations under such
Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee

8.02_, this _Section 8.03_, _Article IX_, the third sentence of _Section
6.02(a)_ and the last sentence of  _Section 6.15(a)_, which provisions shall
survive such termination; _provided_  that nothing herein (including the
payment of any amounts under _Section 8.02_) shall relieve any party from
any liability for any willful and material breach hereof prior to such
termination. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and material breach"
shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken by
the breaching party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act
would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a material breach of this
Agreement, _provided_ , _that_ , for purposes of _Section 6.14_ and _Section
7.01(e)_, the failure of the Company to declare or pay the Special Dividend,
solely due to its legal or practical inability to do so, shall not constitute
a "willful and material breach" of this Agreement as long as such inability
does not result from any action or omission of the Company taken,

  



        
   

  



  

## or not taken, with the purpose of frustrating the satisfaction of the
condition set forth in _Section 7.01(e)_.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after such approval has been
obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further
approval by the stockholders of the Company or Parent without such further
approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) subject to the proviso to the first
sentence of _Section 8.04_, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein.  Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.06 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
