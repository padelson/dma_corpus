(g) _Labor Matters; WARN Act.

 _

(i) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the U.S. Target Companies and their

Date, without fully complying with the notice and other requirements of the
WARN Act or any similar applicable state or local law, regulation or
ordinance, effectuate (x) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act or
such other similar legal obligation) affecting any site of employment or one
or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment of any of
the Asset Sellers or any of the Target Companies or their Subsidiaries, or (y)
a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act or such other similar legal
obligation) affecting any site of employment of any of the U.S. Target
Companies or their Subsidiaries.

 

(ii) If Buyer takes any action after the Closing Date which independently,
or in connection with any reduction in the size of the Business\' work force
occurring within the ninety day period prior to the Closing Date, could be
construed as a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as those terms are defined in
the WARN Act or any similar applicable state or local law, regulation or
ordinance, Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing any notice required
by the WARN Act (or such other similar legal obligation) and for making
payments, if any, and paying all penalties and costs (of Buyer or Seller), if
any, which may result from any failure to provide such notice.

 

(h) _Insurance.

 _

(i) From and after the Closing Date for a period of not less than 5 years,
Buyer will maintain product liability insurance policies with insurance
companies that have a current Best\'s or Standard and Poor\'s rating of not less
than "A-" and a current policyholder\'s surplus of not less than
$1,000,000,000 (or the equivalent if a non-U.S. insurer). Such insurance
policies will designate Seller and each Asset Seller, as its interest may
appear, as additional insureds. The limits of liability, deductibles or
retentions of such product liability insurance will be similar in all material
respects to the limits of liability, deductibles or retentions maintained by
companies of a similar financial size and a similar business purpose as Buyer
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(ii) From and after the Closing Date, Seller will maintain the interest
and rights of the Asset Sellers (to the extent related to the Business) and
the Target Companies and their Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date as
additional named insureds as their interests may appear or beneficiaries or in
any other capacity under the "occurrence based" policies within the Alpharma
Global Insurance Program (other than Foreign Local Insurance Policies assigned
to Buyer or its designees) in respect of occurrences during the period prior
to the Closing Date and will cause such interest and rights to survive the
Closing for a period of not less than 5 years), and shall continue to
administer such policies and programs on behalf of Buyer and its Subsidiaries.
Any Insurance proceeds received by Seller after the Closing under such
policies and programs in respect of the Asset Sellers (to the extent related
to the Business) and the Target Companies and their Subsidiaries shall be for
the benefit of Buyer and its Subsidiaries.

 

(iii) For six years after the Closing Date, Seller shall maintain
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date, covering each director and officer of
each of the Target Companies and their Subsidiaries, on terms with respect to
coverage and amount (including with respect to the payment of attorneys\'
fees) no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; provided that, if the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance
during such period shall exceed 150% of the per annum rate of premium paid by
Seller as of the date hereof for such insurance, then Seller shall provide or
cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best
coverage as shall then be available at 150% of such rate.

 

(i) _Confidentiality_. _

 _

(i) Each of the Sellers shall keep confidential, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to keep confidential, all information relating to the Business ("
_Confidential Business Information_ "), except with respect to Confidential
Business Information (A) that is available to the public prior to the Closing
Date, or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of
a breach of this _0_ or (B) that becomes available to any of the Sellers or
their Subsidiaries after the Closing Date on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than Buyer or its Subsidiaries (provided that such source was not
known by the recipient, after due inquiry, to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with Buyer, with respect to such information, or otherwise
prohibited from transmitting such information due to other contractual, legal
or fiduciary obligations of confidentiality). The covenant set forth in this
_0_ shall terminate three years after the Closing Date.

 

(ii) In the event that any of the Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries is
requested or required, by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
process, to disclose Confidential Business Information, it is agreed that such
Person will provide Buyer with prompt notice of such event so that Buyer may
seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with
this _0_ by such Person. In the event Buyer determines to seek such protective
order or other remedy, any such Person will cooperate with Buyer in seeking
such protective order or other remedy. In the event that such protective order
or other remedy is not obtained and disclosure of Confidential Business
Information is required under applicable law, or Buyer grants a waiver
hereunder, such Person (A) may, without liability hereunder, furnish that
portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Business Information
which, in the written opinion of such Person\'s counsel, such Person is
legally required to disclose and (B) will exercise its commercially reasonable
efforts to have confidential treatment accorded any Confidential Business
Information so furnished.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions of this
_0_ were not performed in accordance with their specific terms and,
accordingly, it is agreed that Buyer shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this _0_ in
any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which Buyer is entitled in law or in equity.

violation of its obligations under _0_.

Agreement. Seller shall be solely responsible for fulfilling all requirements
thereunder, including establishing and maintaining in full force and effect

Without limitation upon the foregoing, Buyer shall execute all certifications
required of the owner or operator of an industrial establishment in connection
with application for the Remediation Agreement (for avoidance of doubt

be responsible for any investigation, remediation or other costs or
requirements under ISRA except to the extent arising from releases of
Hazardous Substances occurring after the Closing Date).

 

(iii) Following the Closing, Seller shall take all actions necessary, at
its sole cost and expense, to achieve ISRA Compliance with respect to the
Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property located in the State of New

occurring after the Closing Date (for which Buyer shall bear sole liability
and responsibility). For purposes of this Agreement, "ISRA Compliance" shall
mean performance by Seller of any requirements imposed under ISRA as a result
of the transactions to be performed in connection with the Closing, and shall
(along with all liability of Seller hereunder with respect to the Owned Real
Property and the Leased Real Property located in the State of New Jersey) be
deemed completed upon a receipt by Seller of a "No Further Action" letter with
respect to these ISRA requirements and upon completion by Seller of any and
all conditions imposed by NJDEP in such "No Further Action" letter.

 

(iv) To the extent it does not incur any material cost or Adverse
Consequences in doing so, Buyer shall timely cooperate with Seller\'s efforts
to comply with ISRA and this provision including providing Seller access to
such real property after the Closing on reasonable terms to be reflected in a
mutually acceptable access agreement to be executed at Closing.

 

(v) Seller shall provide Buyer with reasonable advance notice of, and an
opportunity to comment on, any planned activities and any documents proposed
to be submitted to NJDEP, and with any opportunity for Buyer to participate in
any material meetings or conference calls with NJDEP or Seller\'s
environmental consultants with respect to the actions necessary to achieve
ISRA Compliance provided that Buyer shall take no action which will
unreasonably interfere with Seller\'s prompt and cost-effective completion of
its ISRA responsibilities hereunder. Seller shall not enter into any
agreement, plan or order with respect to ISRA Compliance without Buyer\'s
prior written consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(k) _Cooperation Relating to Exercises of Stock Options._ Buyer shall
cause each of the Foreign Target Companies and their Subsidiaries to (i)(A)

them shall suffer caused, directly or indirectly, by (i) any liability that is
an Assumed Liability and (ii) any liability of any of the Target Companies or
their Subsidiaries that is not a Retained Liability or an Excluded Liability,
except, in each case, to the extent such liability results from a breach of
Seller\'s representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement.

 

(d) _Matters Involving Third Parties.

 _

(i) If any third party shall notify any Person entitled to indemnification
under _Section 8(b)_ or _8(c)_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to
any matter (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against any other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under
this _0_ , then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within
ten business days after receiving notice of the Third-Party Claim) notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure
to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under
this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure; _provided_ _further_ that any
claim with respect to Taxes shall be governed by the procedures set forth in
_0_ and not by this _0_.

 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party will have the right at any time within 60 days
after having received written notice of a Thirty-Party Claim to assume and
thereafter conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld) unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves
only the payment of money damages payable solely by the Indemnifying Party,
does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Party, includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from the
third party in respect of the claim and would not reasonably be expected to
result in any future expenses or costs, or otherwise restrict the future
activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim if (A) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Third
Party Claim and, in the Indemnified Party\'s good faith judgment and based on
the advice of outside counsel, it is advisable for the Indemnified Party to be
represented by separate counsel because a conflict or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or (B) the
Indemnified Party irrevocably waives its right to indemnification under this
_Section 8_ with respect to such Third-Party Claim. Any Remedial Measures
associated with a Third-Party Claim shall be governed by _0_ hereof.

 

(iii) Unless and until an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the
Third-Party Claim as provided in _000_ above, however, the Indemnified Party
may defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem
appropriate. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
at its own expense counsel not reasonably objected to by the Indemnifying
Party separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party.

 

(iv) In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment on or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of each of the Indemnifying Parties (not to
be unreasonably withheld), unless the Indemnified Party shall have irrevocably
and expressly waived in writing its right to indemnification under this
_Section 8_ with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

 

(e) _Limitations on Indemnification

 _

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller shall be required to
indemnify Buyer for any Adverse Consequences arising from Sellers\' breach of
any representations or warranties contained in _Sections 4(f)_ - _(v)_ of this
Agreement unless and until the aggregate amount of all such claims is at least
1% of the Purchase Price (and Sellers shall only be required to indemnify
Buyer for such claims in excess of such amount). Sellers\' aggregate liability
under this _0_ for breaches of any representations or warranties contained in
_Sections 4(f)-(v)_ of this Agreement and for any claims pursuant to _0_ is
limited to an amount equal to 20% of the Purchase Price.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Sellers
shall be obligated to indemnify Buyer against any Adverse Consequences arising
from or relating to any claim or liability to the extent such claim or
liability and the Adverse Consequences therefrom are taken into account in
determining the adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price pursuant to _0_
above.

 

(iii) None of the Sellers shall be obligated to indemnify Buyer against
any Adverse Consequences arising from or relating to any Remedial Measures
except to the extent such Remedial Measures are (a) required by Environmental,
Health, and Safety Requirements or (b) reasonably undertaken in response to a
Third-Party Claim, and then only to the extent of any such action, approved by
the Sellers (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned and subject to Buyer\'s right, acting reasonably, to take actions
in response to exigent circumstances pending receipt of such approval),
reasonably necessary to attain compliance in a cost effective manner with
Environmental Laws or to resolve in a cost effective manner such Third-Party
Claim, in each case assuming continued commercial or industrial use of the
subject property and employing risk based standards and institutional controls
where available.

 

(f) _Determination of Adverse Consequences._ All indemnification payments
under this 0 and under Section 9 below shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party
net of any Tax benefit and insurance coverage that may be available to the
Indemnified Party. All indemnification under this 0 and under Section 9 below
shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 

(g) _Exclusive Remedy._ Subject to Section 11(i), the Parties acknowledge
and agree that, after the Closing, the foregoing indemnification provisions in
this Section 8 and, with respect to Taxes, the provisions of 0, shall be the
exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant hereunder or with respect to the Acquired
Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Excluded Liabilities and Retained Liabilities,
including with respect to any environmental, health and safety matters.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that it shall not have any remedy after the Closing for any breach of
the representations and warranties in Sections 4(f)-(v) above or for any claim
with respect to Taxes under Section 9(b) below, with respect to which Buyer
fails to make a written claim for indemnification within the applicable
survival period set forth in Section 8(a) above.

    _

SECTION 9. Tax Matters.

   _

(a) _Tax-Sharing Agreements._ Any tax-sharing agreement between Seller
and any of the Target Companies or their Subsidiaries shall be terminated as
of the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Tax Indemnification._ Subject in each case to Sections 8(f), 8(g),
and 11(m), the Sellers shall be responsible for and shall pay, and shall
indemnify and hold the Buyer and any of its assignees and Subsidiaries and
their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each a "Tax
Indemnitee") harmless from and shall reimburse such Tax Indemnitee for any and
all Taxes of or attributable to the Acquired Assets, the Target Companies or
the Target Subsidiaries, and any expenses or other losses related thereto that
are incurred, suffered or accrued, (A) for any Pre-Closing Period to the
extent such Taxes exceed the reserve for Non-Income Tax liabilities included
in the Closing Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet, and (B) for (i) any obligation to
contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a consolidated, combined, or
unitary basis with respect to any group of which a Target Company or Target
Subsidiary is a member prior to the Closing for Taxes in respect of a Pre-
Closing Period or a taxable period which includes the Closing Date, (ii) any
Taxes of any Person (other than Buyer or its Affiliates) as transferee or
successor by contract or otherwise for Taxes in respect of a Pre-Closing
Period or (iii) subject to Section 8(a), any misrepresentation, inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, or any breach of a warranty or covenant, related
to Taxes by any of the Seller, the Share Sellers, the Asset Sellers and/or any
of their subsidiaries contained in this Agreement (or in any certificate,
document, list or schedule delivered to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
hereunder) (any of the foregoing, a "Tax Loss"); provided, however, no Tax
Loss may be claimed under this Section 9 by any Tax Indemnitee other than a
single or aggregated Tax Loss in excess of $100,000. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall
have no indemnification obligation pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) for
Taxes included in the reserve for Non-Income Tax liabilities included in the
Closing Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet.

 

(c) _Returns for Periods Through the Closing Date.

 _

(i) Seller shall be responsible for the timely filing (taking into account
any extensions received from the relevant tax authorities) of all Tax Returns
required by law to (A) be filed by the Asset Sellers, (B) be filed by any of
the Target Companies on or prior to the Closing Date, (C) include the Target
Companies in a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed by Seller or
any Affiliate (other than the Target Companies and their Subsidiaries) with
respect to any taxable period ending prior to or including the Closing Date or
(D) any other Income Tax Return of any Target Company that ends on or includes
the Closing Date but is filed after the Closing Date (subject, in the case of
Tax Returns described in clause (D), to the consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). All Taxes due and
payable with respect to such Tax Returns will be paid by Seller as and when
required by law, other than (1) Taxes reflected in the reserve for current
Non-Income Tax liabilities included in the Closing Date Pro Forma Balance
Sheet and (2) Taxes attributable to the Business that are allocable to a Post-
Closing Period, which Taxes shall be paid by Buyer as and when required by
law. Such Tax Returns (and Tax Returns described in the first sentence of this
_0_ that include a Pre-Closing Period) shall be prepared and filed on a basis
consistent with those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different
treatment of any item is required by law, a closing agreement or other
settlement entered into with a taxing authority, or decision of a judicial
authority. Buyer shall be responsible for the filing (or causing to be filed)
of all other Tax Returns related to Target Companies or their Subsidiaries and
the payment of any Taxes related to such Tax Returns.

 

(ii) Seller shall include the income of the U.S. Target Companies and
their Subsidiaries (including any deferred items triggered into income by Reg.
Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under Reg.
Section 1.1502-19) on Seller\'s consolidated federal Income Tax Returns for
all periods through the end of the Closing Date. The U.S. Target Companies and
their Subsidiaries shall furnish Tax information to Seller for inclusion in
Seller\'s federal consolidated Income Tax Return for the period that includes
the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the U.S.
Target Companies and their Subsidiaries. In the case of Income Taxes, the
income and expenses of the U.S. Target Companies and their Subsidiaries shall
be apportioned to the period up to and including the Closing Date and the
period after the Closing Date by closing the books of the U.S. Target
Companies and their Subsidiaries as of the end of the Closing Date. Taxes
other then Income Taxes shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and
the Post-Closing Period based on the relative number of days in such taxable
period that fall within the Pre-Closing Period or the Post-Closing Period, as
the case may be.

 

(d) _Tax Proceedings._ If any third party shall notify any Person
entitled to indemnification under Section 9 (the "Tax Indemnified Party") of
any Tax audit or proceeding, proposed Tax assessment or other Tax matter (a
"Tax Proceeding") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against
any other Party (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") under Section 9, then the Tax
Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within ten business days
after receiving notice of the Tax Proceeding, with an expedited time frame
where necessary to comply with governmental deadlines in connection with such
Tax Proceeding) notify the Tax Indemnifying Party thereof in writing;
provided, however, that failure to timely give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided under this Agreement except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Any such notice shall describe in reasonable detail the type of Tax
involved in the Tax Proceeding, the tax year(s) at issue and the basis for the
Tax Claim against the Tax Indemnifying Party, and shall include a copy of any
materials received from the applicable Taxing Authority in connection
therewith. In the case of any Tax Proceeding that is subject to this Section
9(d), the Controlling Party shall be entitled to appoint as lead counsel any
legal counsel of its choice and shall control the conduct of the Tax
Proceeding. In the case of any such Tax Proceeding, (i) the Controlling Party
shall provide the Noncontrolling Party with a timely and reasonably detailed
account of each stage of the Tax Proceeding and a copy of the portions of all
documents relating to the Tax Proceeding that are relevant to any Tax for
which the Noncontrolling Party may be required to indemnify or may otherwise
be liable, (ii) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Noncontrolling
Party before taking any significant action in connection with the Tax
Proceeding that might adversely affect the Noncontrolling Party, (iii) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Noncontrolling Party and offer the
Noncontrolling Party a reasonable opportunity to comment before submitting any
written materials prepared or furnished in connection with the Tax Proceeding
(including, to the extent practicable, any documents furnished to the
applicable Taxing Authority in connection with any discovery request) to the
extent such materials concern matters in the Tax Proceeding that could
adversely affect the Noncontrolling Party, (iv) the Controlling Party shall
defend the Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith, (v) the Noncontrolling
Party shall reasonably facilitate to the extent requested by the Controlling
Party, and shall not impede, the Tax Proceeding, and (vi) except in the case
of a Tax Proceeding with respect to a consolidated, combined, unitary or group
Tax Return of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries for a taxable period that ends
on or before the Closing Date (other than such a Tax Return that includes
solely Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries), the Controlling Party shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, of the Noncontrolling Party if such settlement,
compromise or abandonment would have an unindemnified adverse impact on the
Noncontrolling Party. If the Noncontrolling Party reasonably withholds such
consent pursuant to the preceding clause (vi), the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve their differences and, failing that, shall submit the
matter to binding arbitration with a mutually acceptable arbitrator (with
expedited time frames where necessary to comply with governmental deadlines in
connection with such audit or proceeding) to resolve the parties\' dispute in
connection with the Tax Proceeding. "Controlling Party" means (I) Seller for
any Tax Proceeding relating to a taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date, (II) Seller for any Tax Proceeding concerning any consolidated,
combined, unitary or group Tax Return that includes Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (except for a consolidated, combined, unitary or group Tax Return
that includes solely Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries), and (III) Buyer for
any Tax Proceeding relating to a taxable period that includes but does not end
on the Closing Date with respect to Buyer or the applicable Subsidiary, or any
taxable period that begins after the Closing Date with respect to Buyer or the
applicable Subsidiary (other than a Tax Proceeding of which Seller is the
Controlling Party pursuant to the preceding clause (II)). "Noncontrolling
Party" shall mean (IV) Seller in the case of a Tax Proceeding with respect to
which Buyer is the Controlling Party and (V) Buyer in the case of a Tax
Proceeding with respect to which Seller is the Controlling Party. The
Controlling Party and the Noncontrolling Party shall cooperate reasonably and
in good faith in connection with any Tax Proceeding that is subject to this
Section 9(d). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither
Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, nor any other person shall have any right to
receive or obtain any information relating to, or have any rights with respect
to, any consolidated, combined, unitary or group Taxes or Tax Returns of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries other than information and rights relating
solely to items of the Target Companies, the Target Subsidiaries and the
Acquired Assets. Furthermore, any rights of Buyer with respect to any
consolidated, combined, unitary or group Taxes or Tax Returns of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries shall apply only to the extent that Buyer might be
adversely affected, it being understood that any claim or issue that would
increase Tax for which Seller is responsible and liable hereunder and decrease
Tax for which Buyer is responsible and liable hereunder would not adversely
affect Buyer.

 

(e) _Code Section 338(h)(10) Election.

 _

(i) At Buyer\'s option, Seller and Buyer shall join in making an election
under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding elections under state,
local, or foreign tax law) (collectively, a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ")
with respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of the U.S. Target
Companies hereunder. As a condition precedent to Seller making a Section
338(h)(10) Election (other than with respect to Alpharma USPD Inc.), Buyer
shall pay to Seller, in cash, the amount of additional consideration necessary
to cause Seller\'s after-Tax net proceeds from the sale of the Target Shares
with the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be equal to the after-Tax net proceeds
that Seller would have received had the Section 338(h)(10) Election not been
made, taking into account all appropriate United States federal, state and
local, and non-United States Tax implications (the " _Tax Adjustment_ "). The
amount of the Tax Adjustment shall be paid to Seller prior to or at the time
Seller signs Forms 8023 and 8883 to make the federal Section 338(h)(10)
Election. Seller shall provide Buyer with a schedule computing the amount of
the Tax Adjustment within 20 days after the Parties have agreed to the
allocation of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 11(n)_. In calculating
the Tax Adjustment with respect to any Section 338(h)(10) Election, the gain
arising from the hypothetical sale of the applicable U.S. Target Company\'s
stock with no Section 338(h)(10) Election (the " _Hypothetical Stock Sale_ ")
and the hypothetical sale of the Target Company\'s assets arising from the
Section 338(h)(10) Election (the " _Hypothetical Asset Sale_ ") each shall be
deemed to be taxable at the highest U.S. federal, state and local, and
non-U.S. corporate tax rates to which Seller is subject, and any other items
of income, deduction, gain, loss or credit of Seller and its Subsidiaries,
including any carryover of such items from prior years, shall be ignored;
provided that any net operating loss carryover, net capital loss carryover and
excess credits attributable to the applicable U.S. Target Company and each
other U.S. Target Company (except Alpharma USPD) shall be taken into account
to the extent available. In furtherance of the cooperation provisions in
_Section 9(i)_ , Seller will furnish Buyer with such information and
assistance as Buyer may reasonably request to enable Buyer to determine the
desirability and consequences of a making Section 338(h)(10) Election with
respect to any of the U.S. Target Companies other than Alpharma USPD Inc., and
all determinations required pursuant to this clause (i) shall be made in good
faith.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall jointly execute
at the Closing and shall file a Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to
the purchase and sale of the stock of Alpharma USPD Inc., and no Tax
Adjustment shall be payable by Buyer in connection with such election. The
Purchase Price allocated to the Alpharma USPD Inc. shares shown on the
Allocation Schedule (as the amount so shown is adjusted pursuant to _Section
11(n)_ to reflect any adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2(f)_ ) shall be increased to the extent necessary (but only to the
extent necessary) to ensure that the aggregate tax basis of the assets of
Alpharma USPD Inc., as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is not
reduced, immediately following the Closing Date, as a result of the Section
338(h)(10) Election. Any such increase shall reduce the amount of Purchase
Price allocated to the shares of the other U.S. Target Companies in a matter
mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good
faith, and each shall provide to the other such assistance as the other may
reasonably request, to effect the adjustments described in this clause (ii).

 

(iii) Except to the extent permitted or required by this _00_ , neither
Buyer nor any of the Target Companies, nor any of their Affiliates, shall make
any election under Code Section 338 with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) _Indemnification for Post-Closing Transactions._ Buyer agrees to
indemnify Seller for any additional Tax owed by Seller (or any of its
Subsidiaries) (including Tax owed by Seller (or any of its Subsidiaries) due
to this indemnification payment) resulting from (i) any transaction engaged in
by Buyer, the Target Companies or their Subsidiaries not in the Ordinary
Course of Business on the Closing Date after Buyer\'s purchase of the Target
Shares or (ii) any action taken by Buyer, or after Closing by any Target
Company or any Subsidiary of a Target Company, during or in respect of a
taxable year of Seller that precedes or includes the Closing Date not in the
Ordinary Course of Business, in each case that affects the amount, timing or
character to Seller and its Subsidiaries of any Tax item relating to the
Target Companies or their Subsidiaries. Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer (or
any of its Subsidiaries) for any additional Tax owed by Buyer (or any of it
Subsidiaries) (including Tax owed by Buyer (or any of it Subsidiaries) due to
this indemnification payment) resulting from any action taken by Seller after
the Closing not in the Ordinary Course of Business, in each case that affects
the amount, timing or character to Buyer or its Subsidiaries of any Tax item
relating to the Target Companies or their Subsidiaries. For purposes of this
Section 9(f), the making of any Section 338(h)(10) Election pursuant to
Section 9(e) and any consequences deemed to occur as a result of such election
shall not be treated as an action that is outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business.

 

(g) _Post-Closing Transactions Not in Ordinary Course._ Buyer and Seller
agree to report all transactions not in the Ordinary Course of Business
relating to the Target Companies or Target Subsidiaries and occurring on the
Closing Date after Buyer\'s purchase of the Target Shares on Buyer\'s federal
Income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Reg. Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

 

(h) _Tax Refunds and Credits._ Subject to the following sentence, any Tax
refunds that are received by Buyer or any Target Company or any Target
Subsidiary, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer or any Target
Company or any Target Subsidiary becomes entitled, that relate to a Pre-
Closing Period shall be for the account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to
Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15)
days after receipt or entitlement thereto, to the extent such refund or credit
exceeds the amount reserved therefor as a Tax asset on the Closing Date Pro
Forma Balance Sheet. Any Income Tax refunds that are received by Seller or any
affiliate (other than Target Company or any Target Subsidiary), and any
amounts credited against Income Tax to which Seller or any affiliate (other
than any Target Company or any Target Subsidiary) becomes entitled, that are
attributable to a carryback of Post-Closing Tax losses or credits attributable
to the Business or any Target Company or Target Subsidiary, shall be for the
account of Buyer, and Seller shall pay over to Buyer any such refund or the
amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or
entitlement thereto, provided that this sentence shall apply only to the
extent that such Post-Closing Tax losses or credits are required by law to be
carried back to a Pre-Closing Period and such carryback cannot be waived. To
the extent requested by Seller, and at Seller\'s expense, Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller in applying for and obtaining any available
Tax refunds with respect to Pre-Closing Periods.

 

(i) _Cooperation._ Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller (on behalf of its
Affiliates), on the other, agree, in each case to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party and at no cost to the other party, to (i) furnish
to the other party in a timely manner information and documents for purposes
of preparing any original or amended Tax Returns to which 0 applies and
contesting or defending any Audit, (ii) cooperate in any Audit, (iii) retain
and provide on demand books, records, documentation or other information
relating to any Tax Return until the later of (A) the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any extension, waiver, or
mitigation thereof) and (B) in the event any claim is made under this
Agreement for which such information is relevant, until a final determination,
as defined under Section 1313(a) of the Code, with respect to such claim; and
(iv) take such action as such other party may deem appropriate in connection
therewith. From the execution of this Agreement through the Closing Date, none
of the Sellers (to the extent it relates to the Business), the Target
Companies or the Target Subsidiaries that are organized under the laws of a
Core Jurisdiction shall (1) make or change any election in respect of Taxes,
(2) adopt or change any accounting method in respect of Taxes, (3) enter into
any closing agreement, (4) settle any material claim or assessment in respect
of Taxes, (5) consent to any extension or waiver of any statute of limitation
applicable to any claim or assessment in respect of Taxes (to the extent it
relates to the Business), or (6) amend any Tax Return, in each case in a
manner that would adversely affect Buyer, without the consent of Buyer, which
shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld; provided that the
foregoing limitation shall not apply with respect to the actions described in
clauses (3) through (6) above in the case of a consolidated, combined, unitary
or group Tax Return of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than a Tax
Return that includes solely one or more Target Companies or Target
Subsidiaries), or a Tax relating to such a Tax Return. After the Closing, the
Buyer shall not (to the extent it relates to the Business), and shall not
permit any of the Target Companies or the Target Subsidiaries that are
organized under the laws of a Core Jurisdiction to, make or change any
election in respect of Taxes, adopt or change any accounting method in respect
of Taxes, enter into any closing agreement, settle any material claim or
assessment in respect of Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of any
statute of limitation applicable to any claim or assessment in respect of
Taxes (to the extent it relates to the Business), or amend any Tax Return, in
each case with respect to a Pre-Closing Period and in a manner that would
adversely affect Seller, without the consent of Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld.

 

(j) _VAT.

 _

(i) Subject to _Section 9(j)(ii)_ , the consideration specified for all
supplies made or deemed to be made under or in connection with this Agreement
shall be exclusive of VAT. Seller and Buyer shall procure that any of their
respective Affiliates receiving the supply in question shall pay to the Person
making that supply (in addition to the specified consideration) all VAT for
which the Person making the supply is required by any Taxing Authority to
charge in relation to that supply. All VAT payable under this Agreement shall
be paid two business days before that Person has to account for the same and
the supplier shall provide a VAT invoice.

 

(ii) The Parties intend that any sale of the Acquired Assets within the
European Union will be treated by the relevant Taxing Authority as a TOGC and
the Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to procure that any such sale
is so treated. This obligation shall not require Seller or the Asset Sellers
to make any appeal to any tribunal or court of law against any determination
of any Taxing Authority that the sale does not amount to a TOGC, unless Buyer
shall by such date as shall reasonably allow Seller to make such appeal or
challenge within any applicable time limit give written notice to Seller that
it requires such appeal or challenge to be made and shall first agree to
indemnify Seller against all irrecoverable costs and expenses that Seller may
incur by taking any such action.

 

(iii) Seller and Buyer shall procure that the Person retaining at the
Closing the VAT records relating to a Business that is sold shall preserve
such records for such periods as may be required by the relevant law and
during such periods shall permit the other Party or its agents at all
reasonable times and subject to reasonable written notice to inspect and take
copies of such records at the cost of the Person requesting such inspection
and/or copies.

 

(iv) If it is finally determined by the relevant Taxing Authority that any
sale of the Acquired Assets under this Agreement does not constitute a TOGC,
then Buyer shall procure that VAT chargeable shall be paid by the relevant
Affiliate to the relevant Asset Seller two business days before the Asset
Seller has to account for the same and against production of a valid VAT
invoice and any VAT records provided by the Asset Seller to the Buyer or
Buyer\'s Affiliate shall be returned to the Asset Seller. Buyer shall
indemnify or procure that such Affiliate shall indemnify the Asset Seller on
an after Tax basis against any penalty and interest charges incurred by the
Asset Seller to any Taxing Authority in relation to such VAT.

 

(k) _Exclusive Tax Remedy._ The rights and obligations of the Parties
with respect to indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be governed
solely by the provisions of this Section 9 and Sections 8(a), 8(c) (which
shall apply to any Tax Claim without regard to the limitations of Section
8(e), but with regard to the Tax Loss dollar threshold specified in Section
9(a)), 8(f) and 8(g), but shall not be subject to the provisions of Sections
8(b), 8(d) and 8(e).

 

SECTION 10. _Termination.

 _

(a) _Termination of Agreement._ Certain of the Parties may terminate this
Agreement as provided below:

 

(i) Buyer and Seller may terminate this Agreement by mutual written
consent at any time prior to the Closing;

 

(ii) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Seller
at any time prior to the Closing in the event (A) Sellers has within the then
previous ten business days given Buyer any notice pursuant to _0_ above and
(B) the development that is the subject to the notice has had a Material
Adverse Effect:

 

(iii) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
Seller at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event Seller has breached
any material representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement
in any material respect, Buyer has notified Seller of the breach, and the
breach has continued without cure for a period of thirty days after the notice
of breach or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before April 16,
2006, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under _0_ hereof
(unless the failure results primarily from Buyer itself breaching any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement); and

 

(iv) Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Buyer
at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event Buyer has breached any
material representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement in
any material respect, Seller has notified Buyer of the breach, and the breach
has continued without cure for a period of thirty days after the notice of
breach or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before April 16,
2006, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under _0_ hereof
(unless the failure results primarily from Seller breaching any

 _

press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Party;
provided, however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes

other Parties prior to making the disclosure) and any Party may issue a press
release upon entering into this Agreement after reasonable consultation with
the other Parties.

(h) _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 

(i) _Specific Performance._ Each Party hereto acknowledges that money
damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach
of this Agreement by such Party and that any such breach would cause the other
Parties thereto irreparable harm. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, each Party hereto also agrees that, in the event of any
breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by such Party,
the other Parties hereto shall be entitled to equitable relief without the
requirement of posting a bond or other security, including in the form of
injunctions and orders of specific performance.

 

(j) _Amendments and Waivers._ No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
Buyer and Seller (on behalf of itself and each of the other Sellers). No
waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Party making such waiver, nor shall such waiver be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

 

(k) _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

 

(l) _Expenses._ Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Buyer and
Seller, on behalf of the other Sellers and the Target Companies and their
Subsidiaries, each will bear its own costs and expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(m) _Transfer Taxes._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to
Section 9(e), all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees
and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as well
as the cost of the filing of all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, shall be borne and paid
equally by Seller and Buyer when due, and Seller and Buyer shall file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation required to be filed by it with
respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by applicable
law, the Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Taxes described in this Section 11(m) shall be governed by this
Section 11(m) and not by Section 8 or 9.

 

(n) _Allocation of Purchase Price._ The Parties agree that the Purchase
Price (and other capitalized costs) will be allocated among the Asset Sellers,
the Share Sellers and the Note Sellers for all purposes (including Tax and
financial accounting purposes) as shown on (or pursuant to the methodology
provided by) the Allocation Schedule attached hereto. Within 90 days following
the Closing Date (or such later time as may be reasonable after the Purchase
Price is determined), Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a schedule
that further allocates (i) the portion of the Purchase Price (and other
capitalized costs) shown on the Allocation Schedule for each Asset Seller,
together with the Assumed Liabilities applicable to such Asset Seller, among
the Acquired Assets sold by such Asset Seller to Buyer, and (ii) the portion
of the Purchase Price (and other capitalized costs) shown on the Allocation
Schedule for each seller of Target Shares among the Target Companies sold by
such seller; provided that, if the Parties make a Section 338(h)(10) election
with respect to the sale of the U.S. Target Companies, such schedule shall
allocate the portion of the Purchase Price (and other capitalized costs)
attributable to each U.S. Target Company, together with the liabilities of
such Target Company, among the assets of such U.S. Target Company. If Buyer
does not receive written notice of Seller\'s objection to such allocation
within 30 days of its delivery to Seller, then such allocation shall be the
final allocation and each of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates
shall report, act, and file Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such
allocation prepared by Buyer. If the Purchase Price is subsequently adjusted,
the adjusted Purchase Price shall be reasonably allocated among the assets in
a manner agreed by Buyer and Seller consistent with the methodology previously
used.

 

(o) _Construction._ The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state,
local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
The word "including" shall mean "including without limitation".

 

(p) _Incorporation of Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules._ The Exhibits,
Annexes, and Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.

 

(q) _Governing Language._ This Agreement has been negotiated and executed
by the Parties in English. In the event any translation of this Agreement is
prepared for convenience or any other purpose, the provisions of the English
version shall prevail.
