To the extent that, despite any attempted restructuring of the Transaction, Tax is nevertheless required to be withheld by Buyer (or any of its assignees) and such withholding of Tax would be required regardless of whether the purchasing entity were formed under the laws of any of Iceland, the jurisdiction of the selling entity, or the jurisdiction of the target entity, the Buyer (or, if different, the applicable purchasing entity) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such Tax, and such withheld Tax shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller, the Share Seller, the Asset Seller or the Note Seller in respect of which such Tax withholding was made by Buyer or its assignee.  Except to the extent provided in this <U>Section 2(b)</U> and <U>Section 7(a)(viii)</U>, the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Purchase Price shall be paid without reduction or offset for any withholding or similar Tax.
