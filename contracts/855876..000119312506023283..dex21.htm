advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders the
merger of the Company with and into the Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ ") upon
the terms and conditions set forth herein in accordance with the Indiana
Business Corporation Law (the " _IBCL_ ") (the Merger Sub, following the
effectiveness of the Merger, being hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Parent and the Company have
approved this Agreement and the Merger pursuant to which the Company will
merge with and into the Merger Sub and each outstanding share of Company
common stock, no par value (the " _Company Stock_ "), will be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein;



WHEREAS, it is intended that for federal income tax purposes the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ");



WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
pursuant to Section 6.16, the Parent is entering into agreements with
the directors and certain shareholders of the Company pursuant to which such
shareholders shall agree to take certain actions to support the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Shareholders Agreements_ "); and



NOW, THEREFORE, on the basis of the foregoing recitals and in
consideration of the respective covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

shall cease. The Merger will have the effects set forth in the IBCL. As used
herein, (i) " _Effective Time_ " means the date and time at which the

the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any Person:



(a) _Outstanding Company Stock_. Except as otherwise provided in this Article
I, each share of Company Stock (excluding any shares of Company Stock held by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case other than in a
fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted in good faith
(" _Treasury Stock_ "), and Company Stock held by Parent) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive (i) a number of shares of the common stock of the Parent,
without par value, (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") based upon a fixed exchange
ratio of 4.38 shares of Parent Common Stock for each share of Company Stock
(the " _Stock Exchange Ratio_ ") and (ii) cash in the amount of $80.07 for
each share of Company Stock (the " _Cash Exchange Ratio_ ," together with the
Stock Exchange Ratio, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").



(b) _Treasury Shares and Shares Held by Parent_. Each share of Company Stock
held as Treasury Stock or held by the Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor. For purposes of this
provision, shares held by Subsidiaries of the Parent shall not be deemed to be
held by the Parent.



(c) _Outstanding Parent Common Stock_. Each share of Parent Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding and unaffected by the Merger.



(d)  _Effect on the Merger Sub Stock_. Each issued and outstanding membership
interest in the Merger Sub shall remain issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time and shall remain unchanged by the Merger.



1.3 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the
Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and cease to exist and holders of Company Stock shall cease to be,
and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company, other than to
receive any dividend or other distribution with respect to such Company Stock
with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time, the consideration
provided under this Article I and the appraisal rights in the case of
Dissenting Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Entity of any Company
Stock (other than Dissenting Shares, if applicable).



1.4 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger
and no Parent dividend or other distribution or stock split or combination
will relate to any fractional share of Parent Common Stock, and
such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder of the Parent; instead,
the Parent shall pay to each holder of Company  



 

2  Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates delivered by such
holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which the holder would be entitled
by the Average NMS Closing Price.



1.5 _Exchange Procedures_.



(a) On the Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with such bank or trust
company as shall be selected by the Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as exchange agent (in such capacity, the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
pursuant to an Exchange Agent Agreement in form and substance mutually
acceptable to the Company and the Parent, for the benefit of the holders of
certificates representing Company Stock (" _Old Certificates_ "), for exchange
in accordance with this Article I, certificates representing the Parent Common
Stock (" _New Certificates_ ") and an amount of cash sufficient to pay the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration, including a good faith estimate of
the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such
cash and New Certificates, together with any dividends or distributions with
a record date occurring on or after the Effective Time with respect thereto
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") to be paid pursuant
to this Article I in exchange for outstanding Company Stock. The Parent shall
make available directly or indirectly to the Exchange Agent, from time to time
as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.4 and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.5(e). As used herein, " _Business Day_ "
means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banks in
Indianapolis, Indiana are required or authorized by Law to be closed.



(b) No interest will be paid on any cash, including any cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or in respect of dividends or
distributions, that any such Person shall be entitled to receive pursuant to
this Article I.



(c) Within five Business Days after the Effective Time, the Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of an Old
Certificate, (i) a form of letter of transmittal specifying that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates will pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
(ii) instructions and procedures for surrendering such Old Certificates in
exchange for the New Certificates. Upon surrender of an Old Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate shall receive in exchange
therefor (A) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article I, and (B) a check in an amount equal to the sum of
the cash to be paid to such holder as part of the Merger Consideration, the
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.4 and the cash to be paid
in respect of any dividends or distributions to which such holder may be
entitled pursuant to Section 1.5(e), after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings, and the Old Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a New Certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be
issued, and the cash to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration, in lieu
of any fractional share of Parent Common  



 

3  Stock and in respect of any dividends or distributions may be paid, to a
transferee if the Old Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer,
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.5(c), each Old Certificate will
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender a New Certificate and a check in an amount equal
to the sum of the cash to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration, the
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock and
the cash to be paid in respect of any dividends or distributions to which the
holder may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.5(e) hereof.



(d) Promptly following the date that is six months after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Entity all cash,
certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions described in this Agreement; and any holders of Company Stock who
have not theretofore complied with this Article I may look thereafter only to
the Surviving Entity for the Parent Common Stock, any dividends or
distributions thereon and any cash to be paid as part of the Merger
Consideration or in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to this Article I, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent
nor any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Company Stock for
any Parent Common Stock, any dividends or distributions thereon or any cash
to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration or in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.



(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock with a record date occurring on or after the date of the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate representing
Company Stock converted in the Merger into the right to receive such Parent
Common Stock until the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive New
Certificates in exchange therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Section 1.5. After becoming so entitled in accordance with this
Section 1.5, the record holder thereof also shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to Parent Common Stock such holder
had the right to receive upon surrender of the Old Certificates.



(f) If any Old Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Old
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Parent
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate (i) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section
1.2(a) with respect to the shares of Company Stock formerly represented
thereby, and (ii) a check in an amount equal to the sum of the cash to be paid
to such Person as part of the Merger Consideration, the cash to be paid in
lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such Person is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.4 and the cash to be paid in respect of any
dividends or distributions to which such Person may be entitled pursuant to
Section 1.5(e).



 

4 (g) The Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the
Companys stock transfer books to establish the identity of those Persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Old Certificate, the Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration or dividends or
distributions thereon represented thereby in escrow with an independent third
party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto. 



(h) The Parent is entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Stock
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any other applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Parent, such withheld amounts may be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of
Company Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made by
the Parent.



1.6  _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by Company shareholders who have asserted
dissenters rights and demanded payment of fair value for such shares of
Company Stock in the time and manner provided in the IBCL and, as of the
Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to
such demand for payment under the IBCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted as described in this Article I, but shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the IBCL; _provided_
, _however_ , that if such holder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
his, her or its right to demand payment of fair value under the IBCL, such
holders shares of Company Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.



(b) The Company shall give the Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
payment of fair value pursuant to the IBCL received by the Company, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
IBCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment of fair value
under the IBCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of the Parent or as otherwise required by applicable Law, make any payment
with respect to any such demands for payment of fair value, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.



1.7 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_.



(a) In the event the Parent changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding
between the date hereof and the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, split up, combination,
exchange of shares, readjustment or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Parent Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior
to the Effective Time, the Stock Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately
adjusted.



 

5 (b) Each share of Parent Common Stock issued as Merger Consideration shall be
accompanied by Rights issued pursuant to the Shareholder Rights Plan of
Parent (then known as Citizens Bancshares, Inc.) dated July 21, 1998, (the "
_Parent Rights Plan_ ") and each New Certificate shall contain the legend
contained in Section 3(c) of the Parent Rights Plan. As used herein, "
_Rights_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Parent Rights
Plan.



1.8 _Company Stock Options_. The Company will take such actions necessary to
ensure that as of the Closing Date, there are no outstanding and unexercised
options to purchase shares of the Company Stock (" _Company Stock Options_ ").
The Company shall obtain from each holder of Company Stock Options and deliver
to the Parent prior to the Closing, documentation reasonably acceptable to
the Parent with respect to the exercise, cancellation, termination or
surrender of such options, including a release of any and all claims with
respect to such Company Stock Options.



1.9 _Directors of Surviving Entity_. At the Effective Time, the Board
of Directors of the Surviving Entity shall be comprised of the Persons
serving as directors of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Such Persons shall serve until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.



1.10 _Executive Officers of Surviving Entity_. At the Effective Time, the
executive officers of the Surviving Entity shall be comprised of the Persons
serving as executive officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Such Persons shall serve until the earlier of their
resignation or termination.



1.11 _Absence of Control_. Subject to any specific provisions of this
Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that neither the Parent nor
the Merger Sub by reason of this Agreement shall be deemed (until consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby) to control, directly or indirectly,
the Company and shall not exercise, or be deemed to exercise, directly or
indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of the
Company.



1.12 _Articles of Organization and Operating Agreement_. The Articles
of Organization of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Organization of the Surviving Entity.
The Operating Agreement of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the Operating Agreement of the Surviving Entity.



1.13  _The Subsidiary Merger_. After the Merger and at the time determined by
the Parent and specified by Sky Bank, an Ohio banking corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent, in the Certificate of Merger filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio (which shall not be earlier than
immediately after the Effective Time), Union Federal Bank of Indianapolis, a
stock savings bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (" _Union
Federal_ "), shall merge with and into Sky Bank (the " _Subsidiary Merger_ ")
pursuant to an agreement to merge (the " _Agreement to Merge_ ") to be
executed by Union Federal and Sky Bank. Upon consummation of the Subsidiary
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Union Federal shall cease and Sky
Bank shall survive and continue to exist as a state banking corporation. The
Parent may at any time prior to the Effective Time change the method of
effecting the Subsidiary Merger (including the provisions of this Section
1.13), subject to the prior written consent of the  



 

6  Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, provided that (a) the Subsidiary Merger occurs after the
Merger, (b) the Merger Consideration to be paid to the Company shareholders
is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount (including by payment of
Taxes on such Merger Consideration or otherwise) as a result of the
modification, (c) such modification will not materially delay or jeopardize
receipt of any required approvals of Governmental Entities or otherwise
materially delay consummation of the Merger and (d) such modification is not
reasonably likely to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code or the
ability of counsel to render the opinions described in Section 9.7 of this
Agreement.

creditors rights generally and to general principles of equity and except to
the extent such enforceability may be limited by Laws relating to the safety
and soundness of insured depository institutions as set forth in 12 U.S.C.
Section 1818(b) or the  



 

12  appointment of a conservator by the FDIC. Prior to the filing of the
Registration Statement in accordance with Section 7.5, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have approved the Termination Proposal.



(b) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and compliance by the
Company with any of the provisions hereof, will not: (i) conflict with or
result in a breach of any provision of its or any of the Company
Subsidiaries Articles or Certificates of Incorporation (or comparable
organizational documents), as amended, or Bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents), as amended; (ii) constitute a breach of or result in a default
(or give rise to any rights of termination, cancellation or acceleration, or
any right to acquire any securities or assets) under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,

dates. No insurer under any such policy or bond has canceled or indicated in
writing an intention to cancel or, as of the date hereof, indicated in writing
an intention not to renew any such policy or bond or generally
disclaimed liability thereunder. None of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is in default under any such policy or bond which is material to
the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and all material claims thereunder have been filed  



 

13  in a timely fashion. Except for policies insuring against potential
liabilities of officers, directors and employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, the Company or the relevant Company Subsidiary is the
sole beneficiary of such policies. All premiums and other payments due under
any such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed, in

free and clear of all Liens except (a) statutory Liens for amounts not yet due
and payable, (b) pledges to secure deposits and borrowings and other Liens
incurred in the ordinary and usual course of banking business, (c)

interests, if any, as do not affect the use of properties or assets subject

properties, and (d) Liens on properties acquired in foreclosure or on account
of debts previously contracted. All leases pursuant to which the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, as lessee, leases real or personal property

held under valid leases or subleases enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and to general equity principles) without default
thereunder by the lessee or, to the Companys Knowledge, the lessor.
All material tangible properties of the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries are in a commercially usable state of maintenance and repair,
conform with all applicable ordinances, regulations and zoning Laws and are

by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, whether by foreclosure or
acquisition of deeds in lieu of foreclosure of mortgages or otherwise, other

4.10 _Litigation_. Except for foreclosure proceedings relating to the
Companys servicing business in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a plaintiff involving claims of less than $500,000 per proceeding and for
which no counterclaim against the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall have
been filed, there is no suit, action, investigation, inquiry or proceeding
(whether judicial, arbitral, administrative or otherwise) pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or affecting the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or
order of any Governmental Entity outstanding against the Company or any

that have not been: (a) fully reflected or reserved against in the Company
Financial Statements; or (b) incurred subsequent to the date of the most
recent balance sheet contained in the Company Financial Statements in the
ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past practices.



4.24 _Employee Benefit Plans_. 



(a) The Company has previously made available to the Parent copies of each
material "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (" _ERISA_ "), of which the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries is a sponsor or participating employer or as
to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries makes contributions or
is required to make contributions and which is subject to any provision of
ERISA and covers any current or former employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, together with all amendments thereto, all currently
effective and related summary plan descriptions, the determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), the annual reports for the most
recent three years (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B) and a
summary of material modifications prepared in connection with any such plan.
Such plans are hereinafter referred to collectively as the " _Employee Plans_
," and are listed in Section 4.24(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. No
Employee Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA. Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified in form
and operation under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS and the associated trust for each such
Employee Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. All
amendments required to bring each Employee Plan into conformity with all of
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws
have been made, except to the extent that such amendments may be retroactively
adopted under Section 401(b) of the Code and the regulations issued
thereunder.



(b) The Company has previously made available to the Parent copies or
descriptions of each material employment agreement, plan or arrangement
maintained or otherwise contributed to by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries which is not an Employee Plan and which (exclusive of (i) base
salary, (ii) base wages, (iii) arrangements terminable at the will of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary, (iv) reimbursement for unused vacation or
sick days, (v) normal payroll policies including salary continuation during
holidays, vacations, sick or personal time and jury duty services, bereavement
pay, personal leaves of absence, armed forces leaves of absence and paid
medical leave, and (vi) any benefit required by Law (with respect to clauses
(iv) and (v) of this parenthetical, which items are described in, and provided
only as described in, the Waterfield Employee Handbook and the Union Federal
Employee Handbook, the current versions of which have been provided to
Parent) provides for any form of current or deferred compensation, bonus,
stock option, stock award, stock-based compensation or other form of incentive
compensation, post-termination benefit or insurance, profit sharing,
retirement benefit, severance, change-in-control, group health or insurance
benefit, disability benefit, or  



 

22  welfare or similar benefit to or for the benefit of any employee or class of
employees, or former employee or class of former employees, or director
or former director, of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Such
plans and arrangements are hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Benefit
Arrangements_ " and are listed in Section 4.24(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.



(c) Other than as required by Law, there has been no amendment to any
Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement that would materially increase the
expense of maintaining such Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement above the
level of the expense incurred for the most recent fiscal year.



(d) Each Employee Plan and Benefit Arrangement has been established
and maintained in accordance with its terms and is in compliance with the
requirements prescribed by all applicable statutes, governmental or court
orders, or governmental rules or regulations currently in effect, including
ERISA and the Code. All government reports and filings required by Law have
been properly and timely filed and all information required to be distributed
to participants or beneficiaries has been distributed, in each case with
respect to each Employee Plan and Benefit Arrangement. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have performed all of their obligations under all such
Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements in all material aspects. There is no
pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened legal action, proceeding
or investigation against the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to
any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement, other than routine claims for
benefits. No Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement is under audit
or investigation by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and to the Knowledge of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, no such audit or investigation is pending or threatened.
No condition exists that could constitute grounds for the termination of any
Employee Plan under Section 4042 of ERISA. No "prohibited transaction," as
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred with
respect to any Employee Plan which could subject the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to liability under Title I of ERISA or to the imposition of tax
under Section 4975 of the Code. No Employee Plan subject to Part 3 of Subtitle
B of Title I of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or both, has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of the Code,
whether or not waived. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
failed to make any contribution or pay any amount due and owing as required
by the terms of any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement. No "reportable
event" as defined in ERISA has occurred with respect to any of the Employee
Plans. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has incurred
or expects to incur, directly or indirectly, any liability under Title IV of
ERISA arising in connection with the termination of, or a complete or partial
withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA
which could constitute a liability of the Surviving Entity or of any of its
Affiliates (including the Company Subsidiaries) at or after the Effective
Time.



(e) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has provided or is
required to provide security to any Employee Plan pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code. Each of the Employee Plans that is intended to be a
qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary knows of any fact that would adversely affect the qualified status
of any such Employee Plan that would not be correctable under the Employee
Plans Correction Resolution System (Rev. Proc. 2003-44) without material cost
to the Company or any of the  



 

23  Company Subsidiaries. All contributions required to be made to each of the
Employee Plans under the terms of the Employee Plans, ERISA, the Code or any
other applicable Laws have been timely made. As of the date hereof, the
Company Financial Statements properly reflect all amounts required to be
accrued as liabilities to date under each of the Employee Plans. The fair
market value of the assets of each Employee Plan and Benefit Arrangement that
is required to be funded under the terms of the Employee Plan or Benefit
Arrangement, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law, equals or exceeds
the present value of benefit obligations, of such Employee Plan or Benefit
Arrangement. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no obligation to
provide post-termination or retiree medical or life insurance benefits to any
Person for any reason, except as may be required by the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended or similar state statute.



(f) Each Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement can be terminated without
liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiaries. There does not now
exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled
Group Liability that would be a material liability of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries following the Effective Time. " _Controlled Group
Liability_ " means any and all liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii)
under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, or
(iv) as a result of a failure to comply with the continuation coverage
requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code.



(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in, cause the accelerated
vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
material payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the
right of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or
receive a reversion of assets from any Company Employee Plan or Company
Benefit Arrangement. No Company Benefit Arrangement, individually or
collectively, could give rise to the payment by Parent, Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries of any amount that would not be deductible by reason of
Code Section 280G.



4.25 _Offices and ATMs_. The Company Disclosure Letter contains a list (the "
_Company Offices List_ ") setting forth the headquarters of each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (identified as such) and, as of the date
hereof, each of the offices and automated teller machines (" _ATMs_ ")
maintained and operated by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (other than
offices transferred pursuant to the Disposition of the Mortgage Banking
Business) and the location thereof. Except as set forth on the Company
Offices List or in connection with the Disposition of the Mortgage Banking
Business, as of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries maintains any other office or ATM or conducts business at any
other location, and neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries has

compensate any Person for its use of any Intellectual Property and the Company
has not granted to any Person any license, option or other rights to use in
any manner any of the Company Intellectual Property, whether requiring the

and the Parent Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns. Except for any
transactions contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, since the date of
the most recent balance sheet of the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries

of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4 (or any predecessor provision).

(c) Sky Bank has received a rating of "Satisfactory" in its most recent
examination or interim review with respect to the CRA. The Parent has no

believe (because of Sky Banks HMDA data for the year ended December 31, 2004
filed with the Ohio Department of Commerce Division of Financial Institutions
on or prior to March 1, 2005, or otherwise) that any facts or circumstances
exist, which would cause Sky Bank or any other Parent Subsidiary: (i) to be
deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the
CRA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating
for CRA purposes by federal or state bank regulators of lower than
"satisfactory"; or (ii) to be deemed to be operating in violation in any
material respect  



 

34  of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order issued with respect to

transactions contemplated hereby, and neither the execution of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions provided for herein will result in
any liability or any commitment for fees or commissions to any other broker,
finder or financial advisor.



5.11 _Scheduled Contracts_. Except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure
Letter (each item listed or required to be listed in such Parent Disclosure
Letter being referred to herein as a " _Parent Scheduled Contract_ "),

Subsidiaries (or would restrict any Affiliate of the Parent or the
Parent Subsidiaries or the Surviving Entity (including the Merger Sub and the
Company Subsidiaries) after the Effective Time of the Merger) from competing
in any line of business with any Person or using or employing the services of
any Person. Complete copies of all Parent Scheduled Contracts, including all
amendments and supplements thereto, entered into on or before the date hereof
have been made available to the Company. Each Parent Scheduled Contract is
valid, binding and in full force and effect and is enforceable in accordance
with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and to general principles
of equity and except to the extent such enforceability may be limited by Laws
relating to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions as set
forth in 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(b) or the appointment of a conservator by the
FDIC.



5.12 _Material Adverse Change_. Since September 30, 2005, the Parent has not,
on a consolidated basis, suffered a change in its business, financial
condition or results of operations that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



5.13 _Licenses and Permits_. Each of the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
has all material licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals of,
and has made all filings, applications and registrations with all Regulatory
Authorities or Governmental Entities that are necessary for the conduct of
its business and to own or lease their properties, and all such licenses,
permits, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and
effect and, to the Parents Knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any of
them is threatened or is  



 

35  reasonably expected by the Parent to occur, and all such filings,
applications and registrations are current. The respective properties, assets,
operations and businesses of the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are and
have been maintained and conducted, in all material respects, in compliance
with all such applicable licenses and permits. No proceeding is pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Parent, threatened by any Governmental Entity which
seeks to revoke or limit any such licenses or permits.



5.14 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Parent nor any of the Parent
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations, either accrued
or contingent, that have not been: (a) fully reflected or reserved against in
the Parent Financial Statements; or (b) incurred subsequent to the date of the
most recent balance sheet contained in the Parent Financial Statements in
the ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past practices.



5.15 _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) The Parent has previously made available to the Company copies of each
material "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) ERISA, of which
the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a sponsor or participating
employer or as to which the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries makes
contributions or is required to make contributions and which is subject to any
provision of ERISA and covers any current or former employee of the Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries, together with all amendments thereto, all
currently effective and related summary plan descriptions, the determination
letter from the IRS, the annual reports for the most recent three years (Form
5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B) and a summary of material
modifications prepared in connection with any such plan. Such plans are
hereinafter referred to collectively as the " _Parent Employee Plans_ ," and
are listed in Section 5.15(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter. No Parent
Employee Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA. Each Parent Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified in form and
operation under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS and the associated trust for each such
Parent Employee Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. All
amendments required to bring each Parent Employee Plan into conformity with
all of the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable
Laws have been made, except to the extent that such amendments may be
retroactively adopted under Section 401(b) of the Code and the regulations
issued thereunder. 



(b) The Parent has previously made available to the Company copies or
descriptions of each material employment agreement, plan or arrangement
maintained or otherwise contributed to by the Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries which is not a Parent Employee Plan and which (exclusive of base
salary and base wages and any benefit required by Law) provides for any form
of current or deferred compensation, bonus, stock option, stock award, stock-
based compensation or other form of incentive compensation, post-termination
benefit or insurance, profit sharing, retirement benefit, severance, change-
in-control, group health or insurance benefit, disability benefit, or welfare
or similar benefit to or for the benefit of any employee or class of
employees, or former employee or class of former employees, or director or
former director, of the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries. Such plans
and arrangements are hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Parent Benefit
Arrangements_ " and are listed in Section 5.15(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter.



 

36 (c) Other than as required by Law, there has been no amendment to any Parent
Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Arrangement that would materially increase
the expense of maintaining such Parent Employee Plan or Parent Benefit
Arrangement above the level of the expense incurred for the most recent fiscal
year.



(d) Each Parent Employee Plan and Parent Benefit Arrangement has
been established and maintained in accordance with its terms and is in
compliance with the requirements prescribed by all applicable statutes,
governmental or court orders, or governmental rules or regulations currently
in effect, including ERISA and the Code. All government reports and filings
required by Law have been properly and timely filed and all information
required to be distributed to participants or beneficiaries has been
distributed, in each case with respect to each Parent Employee Plan and
Parent Benefit Arrangement. The Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have
performed all of their obligations under all such Parent Employee Plans and
Parent Benefit Arrangements in all material aspects. There is no pending or,
to the Parents Knowledge, threatened legal action, proceeding or
investigation against the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary with respect to any
Parent Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Arrangement, other than routine claims
for benefits. No Parent Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Arrangement is under
audit or investigation by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and to the Knowledge of the Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, no such audit or investigation is pending or threatened. No
condition exists that could constitute grounds for the termination of any
Parent Employee Plan under Section 4042 of ERISA. No "prohibited transaction,"
as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred
with respect to any Parent Employee Plan which could subject the Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to liability under Title I of ERISA or to the imposition of
tax under Section 4975 of the Code. No Parent Employee Plan subject to Part 3
of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or both, has
incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of
the Code, whether or not waived. Neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
has failed to make any contribution or pay any amount due and owing as
required by the terms of any Parent Employee Plan or Parent Benefit
Arrangement. No "reportable event" as defined in ERISA has occurred with
respect to any of the Parent Employee Plans. Neither the Parent nor any of
the Parent Subsidiaries has incurred or expects to incur, directly or
indirectly, any liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with
the termination of, or a complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan
covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA which could constitute a
liability of the Surviving Entity or of any of its Affiliates (including the
Parent Subsidiaries) at or after the Effective Time. 



(e) Neither the Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has provided or is
required to provide security to any Parent Employee Plan pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code. Each of the Parent Employee Plans that is intended to
be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS and neither the Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary knows of any fact that would adversely affect the qualified status
of any such Parent Employee Plan that would not be correctable under the
Employee Plans Correction Resolution System (Rev. Proc. 2003-44) without
material cost to the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries. All
contributions required to be made to each of the Parent Employee Plans under
the terms of the Parent Employee Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other
applicable Laws have been timely made. As of the date hereof, the Parent
Financial Statements properly reflect all amounts required to be accrued as
liabilities to date under each of the Parent Employee Plans.  



 

37  The fair market value of the assets of each Parent Employee Plan and Parent
Benefit Arrangement that is funded, or required to be funded under the terms
of the Parent Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Arrangement, ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable Law, equals or exceeds the present value of benefit
obligations, of such Parent Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Arrangement. The
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have no obligation to provide post-
termination or retiree welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except
as may be required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended or similar state statute. 



(f) Each Parent Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Arrangement can be terminated
without liability to the Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries. There does not now
exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled
Group Liability that would be a material liability of the Parent or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.



5.16  _Reserved_.



5.17 _Intellectual Property_. To the Knowledge of the Parent, the Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries own or have a valid license to all Intellectual
Property necessary to carry on their business including all tangible
embodiments of such Intellectual Property substantially as
currently conducted (collectively, " _Parent Intellectual Property_ "). Other
than commercially available software licensed in the ordinary course of
business, neither the Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has any
obligation to compensate any Person for its use of any Intellectual Property
and the Parent has not granted to any Person any license, option or other
rights to use in any manner any of the Parent Intellectual Property, whether
requiring the payment of royalties or not. The Parent Intellectual Property
will not be impaired by reason of the performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Parent nor
any of the Parent Subsidiaries has received any notice of infringement of or
conflict with, and to the Parents Knowledge, there are no infringements of or
misappropriation or conflicts with, the rights of others with respect to the
use of any Parent Intellectual Property. All Parent Intellectual Property not
licensed to the Parent is solely owned by the Parent or a Parent Subsidiary
free and clear of all Liens.



5.18 _Loan Portfolio; Asset Quality_.



(a) With respect to each loan owned by the Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries
in whole or in part (each, a " _Parent Loan_ "), to the Knowledge of the
Parent:



(1) the note and the related security documents are each legal, valid and
binding obligations of the maker or obligor thereof, enforceable against such
maker or obligor in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and
to general principles of equity;



(2) neither the Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries nor any prior holder
of a Parent Loan has modified the note or any of the related
security documents in any material respect or satisfied, canceled or
subordinated the note or any of the related security documents except as
otherwise disclosed by documents in the applicable Parent Loan file;



 

38 (3) the Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is the sole holder of legal and
beneficial title to each Parent Loan (or the Parents applicable
participation interest, as applicable), except as otherwise disclosed by

(4) the note and the related security documents, copies of which are included
in the Parent Loan files, are true and correct copies of the documents
they purport to be and have not been suspended, amended, modified, canceled

applicable Parent Loan file;



(5) there is no pending or threatened condemnation proceeding or similar
proceeding affecting the property which serves as security for a Parent Loan,
except as otherwise disclosed by documents in the applicable Parent Loan file;



(6) there is no pending or threatened litigation or proceeding relating to the
property which serves as security for a Parent Loan; and



(7) with respect to a Parent Loan held in the form of a participation,
the participation documentation is legal, valid, binding and enforceable.



(b) The Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth by category the amounts of all
loans, leases, advances, credit enhancements, other extensions of credit,
commitments and interest-bearing assets of the Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries that have been classified by any bank examiner (whether
regulatory or internal) as "Other Loans Specially Mentioned," "Special
Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss," "Classified," "Criticized,"
"Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans" (in the latter two cases, to the
extent available) or words of similar import, and the Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries shall promptly after the end of any month inform the Company of
any such classification arrived at any time after the date hereof. The Other
Real Estate Owned included in any non-performing assets of the Parent or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries is carried net of reserves at the lower of cost or
fair value, less estimated selling costs, based on current independent
appraisals or evaluation or current management appraisals or evaluations;
_provided_ , _however_ , that "current" shall mean within the past 12
months. 



5.19 _Allowance for Loan Losses_. The allowance for loan losses reflected on
the Parent Financial Statements, as of their respective dates, is adequate in
all material respects under the requirements of GAAP and applicable regulatory

outstanding loans owned by the Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries in whole or
in part, net of recoveries.

to the Parent and its representatives, counsel, accountants, agents and
employees reasonable access during normal business hours to all of its and the
Company Subsidiaries business, operations, employees, properties, books,

representatives, counsel, accountants, agents and employees to conduct an

or the Company to the purchaser or the purchaser to Union Federal or the

6.4 _Company Shareholder Action_. As promptly as practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company will take action necessary in
accordance with applicable Law and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to
convene a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment or
postponement, the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_") to consider and vote  



 

46  upon the approval of the Company Proposals (such approval, the " _Company
Shareholder Approval_ ") and to solicit such Company Shareholder Approval as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective. The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Company Proposals by the Companys
shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting (the " _Company
Recommendation_ ") and shall include such recommendation in a written
communication to the Company shareholders concerning this Agreement or the
Company Proposals. The Board of Directors of the Company may fail to make
such a recommendation referred to above, or withdraw, modify or change any
such recommendation only if such Board of Directors, after having consulted
with and considered the advice of its outside financial and legal advisors,
has determined that the making of such recommendation, or the failure so to
withdraw, modify or change its recommendation, would constitute a breach of
the fiduciary duties of such directors under applicable Law. The
Company shall otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to the
Company Shareholders Meeting.



6.5 _Applications_. The Company agrees to provide information reasonably
requested by the Parent for the preparation of any applications necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company covenants and
agrees that, with respect to the written information relating to the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, any proxy statement or other information provided
by the Company to the Company shareholders will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of applicable Law, and will not contain any
untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Parent in
obtaining all approvals or consents of Governmental Entities necessary to
effect the Merger and the transactions contemplated herein.



6.6 _No Solicitation_. __ From and after the date hereof until the termination
of this Agreement, neither the Company, nor any of the Company Subsidiaries,
nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives,
agents and Affiliates (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries), will, directly or
indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information or assistance) the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below), or enter into or maintain or continue discussions
or negotiate with any Person in furtherance or to obtain an Acquisition
Proposal or agree to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal, or authorize any of
its officers, directors, or employees or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by any of the Company Subsidiaries to take any such
action, and the Company shall notify the Parent orally of all of the relevant
details relating to all proposals which it or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or any such officer, director or employee, or, to the Companys Knowledge,
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative of the Company may receive relating to any of such matters,
_provided_ , _however __,_ that nothing contained in this Section 6.6 shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under federal or state Law; _provided_   _further_ ,
_however_ , that any such disclosure regarding any Acquisition Proposal shall
be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of
the Company reaffirms the Company  



 

47  Recommendation; or (ii) furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal, if, and only to the extent that, (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors), taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, that
such proposal, if consummated, is reasonably likely to result in a transaction
more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view
than the Merger; (B) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial and legal advisors) that the
failure to furnish information to or enter into discussions with such Person
would likely cause the Board of Directors to breach its fiduciary duties to
shareholders under applicable Law (such proposal that satisfies clauses (A)
and (B) being referred to herein as a " _Superior Proposal_ "); (C) the
Company promptly notifies the Parent of such proposals or offers received by,
any such information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its
representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers, and
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement in form and
substance identical in all material respects to the confidentiality agreements
that the Company and the Parent entered into; and (D) the Company
Shareholders Meeting has not occurred. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer as to any of the
following (other than the transactions contemplated hereunder or in
connection with the Disposition of the Mortgage Banking Business) involving
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries: (i) any merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, or other similar transactions; (ii) any
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 25%
or more of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in a single transaction or series of transactions; (iii) any tender
offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company or the filing of a registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") in connection
therewith; or (iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to
do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing. To
the Companys Knowledge, no Acquisition Proposal is outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement.



6.7  _Affiliates_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each director, executive officer and other Person who is an "affiliate"
(for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the Company to deliver
to the Parent, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, a written agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and the Parent.



 

6.8 _Excluded Assets and Liabilities_.



(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.8 and Section 6.9, the
Disposition of the Mortgage Banking Business shall be completed by
the Company prior to the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet Date. The Company hereby
agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
amount of Excluded Assets and Liabilities that remain outstanding prior to the
Pre-Closing Balance Sheet Date which are subsequently transferred to the
Shareholder Representative in accordance with Section 6.8(c).



 

48 (b) Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the Companys
preliminary list of all of the Excluded Assets and Liabilities and the
respective values for each of the assets and liabilities identified thereon
determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. The Company shall
deliver to Parent not later than 30 days following the end of each month an
update to the foregoing schedule in substantially similar form, which updated
schedule shall (i) specifically identify any additional assets or liabilities
which constitute Excluded Assets and Liabilities that were not included in
the prior schedule and (ii) exclude any Excluded Assets and Liabilities
liquidated or sold or transferred to a third party since the prior schedule.
No later than 90 days following the date of this Agreement, the parties shall
meet to evaluate the status of the transactions contemplated by the AHM
Purchase Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Other Asset
Transfers. At such meeting, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonably
detailed analysis of its expected treatment of all Excluded Assets and
Liabilities that remain outstanding as of such date. The Company shall afford
Parent a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on, and consult with the
Company with respect to, the Companys plans for such remaining Excluded
Assets and Liabilities.



(c) Except as provided in Section 6.8(d) below, the Company hereby agrees
that all Excluded Assets and Liabilities shall be liquidated and wound up,
sold to a third party and wound up or transferred to the Shareholder
Representative and wound up, in each case, prior to the Pre-Closing Balance
Sheet Date. As used herein, " _wound up_ " or " _wind up_ " means, with
respect to any Excluded Assets and Liabilities, to the extent applicable, (i)
the termination or assumption by a third party or the Shareholder
Representative of all contracts in respect thereof and in the case of
termination, payment or satisfaction in full of any and all obligations
thereunder and in the case of assumption, the receipt of any required consent
of a third party or Governmental Entity where the failure to obtain such
consent would result in the breach of contravention of the rights of such
third party or Governmental Entity (each, a " _Consent_ "), (ii) obtaining
either (x) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the satisfaction of
all existing and future payment obligations in respect thereof or (y)
customary releases of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable,
and (iii) the surrender to all applicable Governmental Entities of all
existing licenses and any other existing regulatory approvals in respect
thereof. Nothwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, any obligation to "wind up" Excluded Assets and Liabilities shall
not apply to (i) the assets and liabilities that are subject to either the AHM
Purchase Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement and sold pursuant thereto
in accordance with the terms thereof, (ii) the loans identified as Account
Numbers 1018, 1026, 1028, 1034, 1136, 1312, 1313 and 1970 (the " _S andD
Loans_"), (iii) the membership interests of Quantum Settlement Services, LLC
and (iv) the capital stock of Waterfield Reinsurance Corp., the sale or
disposition of each of the assets and liabilities referenced in clauses (i)
through (iv) shall nevertheless continue to be required as part of the
Disposition of the Mortgage Banking Business.



(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any existing or future liabilities or
obligations relating to the Excluded Assets and Liabilities, which liabilities
or obligations are not "wound up" prior to the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet Date,
shall be deemed to have been retained by the Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary (the " _Retained Excluded Liabilities_ ") subject to the
terms of this Section 6.8, _provided_ that the aggregate amount of all
existing and future liabilities and obligations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries related to the Retained Excluded Liabilities determined
as of the time immediately prior to the Pre-Closing Balance  



 

49  Sheet Date shall not exceed $3,000,000. If any Consent is not obtained prior
to the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet Date, Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall cooperate in any lawful and reasonable arrangements
reasonably proposed by the Shareholder Representative under which the
Shareholder Representative shall obtain the economic claims, rights, benefits,
liabilities and obligations under the applicable contract with respect to
which the Consent has not been obtained. The Shareholder Representative shall
bear the entire cost of any such arrangement and shall promptly reimburse
Parent, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all costs and expenses
incurred by them in connection with such arrangement. The Shareholder
Representative shall indemnify Parent, the Company and their respective
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, stockholders,
agents and representatives against and hold them harmless from any loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) suffered or incurred by such indemnified party to the extent arising
from any Retained Excluded Liabilities. The Shareholder Representative shall
use its commercially reasonably efforts to cause the Retained Excluded
Liabilities to be wound up as promptly as practicable after the Spin-Off
until, subject to the conditions set forth below, the earlier of (i) the
second anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the reasonable determination by
the Shareholder Representative and Parent that the then remaining aggregate
amount of existing and future liabilities and obligations of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries related to the then existing Retained Excluded
Liabilities is less than $500,000 (the " _Expiration Date_ "). The Shareholder
Representative shall be responsible for all costs and expenses
associated with satisfaction of the obligations set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence. The Shareholder Representatives obligations with respect
to the Retained Excluded Liabilities after the Spin-Off as provided above
shall terminate at the Expiration Date upon payment in cash to Parent of an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of the existing and future liabilities
and obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries related to such
then remaining Retained Excluded Liabilities as agreed to by the Parent and
the Shareholder Representative (the " _Release Payment_ "). Upon payment in
full by the Shareholder Representative to the Parent of the then remaining
Retained Excluded Liabilities, the Parent shall execute such assignments or
other documents and instruments as may be customary to evidence the transfer
of such obligations and a mutually acceptable release in favor of the
Shareholder Representative releasing the Shareholder Representative from any
further obligation with respect to the Retained Excluded Liabilities.
Thereafter, if the Parent receives any payments from a third party in respect
of the Retained Excluded Liabilities, Parent shall promptly forward such
payment to the Shareholder Representative. Until the Release Payment is made
to Parent, the Shareholder Representatives obligations with respect to such
Retained Excluded Liabilities shall remain in effect notwithstanding that the
Expiration Date shall have occurred.



6.9 _Pre-Closing Balance Sheet_. The Company shall deliver to Parent, not
later than 30 days following the end of each month, a pro forma Pre-Closing
Balance Sheet as of such month end. Each such pro forma Pre-Closing Balance
Sheet shall be prepared in the same manner and on a basis consistent with the
methodologies set forth below for the preparation of the Pre-Closing Balance
Sheet and the calculation of the Target Equity Amount. Within 15 days
following the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet Date or, if later, within two Business
Days following the later to occur of the events set forth in clauses (i) and
(ii) of the definition of Pre-Closing Balance Sheet Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a consolidated balance sheet dated as of the Pre-Closing
Balance Sheet Date, which consolidated balance sheet shall be adjusted to
give effect to any Other Asset Transfers completed subsequent to the Pre-
Closing Balance Sheet Date  



 

50  and prior to the satisfaction of the later to occur of the events set forth
in clause (i) and (ii) of the definition of Pre-Closing Balance Sheet Date,
as if such Other Asset Transfers had been completed immediately prior to the
Pre-Closing Balance Sheet Date (the " _Pre-Closing Balance Sheet_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver each pro forma Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and
the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet as soon as practicable after the month end or
the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet Date, as applicable. " _Pre-Closing Balance
Sheet Date_ " shall mean the last day of the month prior to the month in
which the later of (i) the Disposition of the Mortgage Banking Business and
(ii) the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions specified in
Articles IX, X, and XI hereof (other than any such conditions which are by
their terms to be satisfied or waived as of the Closing and exclusive of any
applicable waiting period relating to regulatory approval), occurs. The
Company covenants and agrees that the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet will reflect
at least $90,000,000 in shareholders equity as determined in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Company Financial Statements and
the assumptions set forth on _Exhibit C_ attached hereto and reduced to
reflect certain expenses that can be identified prior to the Pre-Closing
Balance Sheet Date, which expenses are described on _Exhibit D_ attached
hereto (" _Target Equity Amount_ "), as adjusted as described in this Section
6.9. Provided that the shareholders equity as finally determined in
accordance with this Section 6.9 is at least equal to the Target Equity
Amount, the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared to reflect dividends
paid or to be paid to the Companys shareholders prior to the Closing. The
Company shall use its best efforts to cause the shareholders equity, as
adjusted herein, on the Closing Date to equal or exceed shareholders equity,
as adjusted herein, reflected on the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, all assets and liabilities held by
the Shareholder Representative shall not be deemed to be held by the Company
for purposes of preparing the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet. The Company agrees
to consult and maintain ongoing communications with Parent and Parents
independent auditors in connection with the preparation of the Pre-Closing
Balance Sheet. Such consultation shall include granting Parent and its
independent auditors access to all working papers of the Company relating to
the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet. The Pre-Closing Balance Sheet shall become
final and binding on the parties following the 5th Business Day following
delivery thereof to the Parent, unless the Parent gives written notice of its
disagreement with the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet (a " _Notice of Disagreement_
") to the Company prior to such date. If a Notice of Disagreement is received
by the Company in a timely manner, then the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet (as

increase Sellers post-closing obligations thereunder shall not be deemed to
be unreasonable. The Company shall not amend or modify, or waive any
provision or condition of the Asset Purchase Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, except that Parents good faith refusal to
consent to any amendment, modification or waiver that would affect the

31, 2006 (it being understood with respect to any SandD Loan sold on a servicing
released basis, the actual transfer of the servicing function might occur
subsequent to March 31, 2006, and that there may be a holdback of a portion
of the purchase price related to the delivery of all necessary mortgage loan
files with respect thereto). If the sale of the SandD Loans is not consummated
by March 31, 2006, then any Repurchase Obligation shall be deemed a

prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an
officer or director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any
such Person presently or formerly serving at the request of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee
or fiduciary of another Person, or under or with respect to any
employee benefit plan (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities, penalties, or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation whether civil, criminal, or
administrative, based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part
out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or pertaining to any matter
existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the
Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") (x) to the same extent
such Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as
of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Companys
Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in
 



 

55  existence on the date hereof (all such agreements being listed in the
Company Disclosure Letter) with any directors or officers of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and (y) without limitation of, and in addition to
clause (x), to the fullest extent permitted by Law.



(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving
Entity may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable
insurer of at least the same coverage, amounts and retentions containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Entity shall not be
obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent
such premiums exceed 200% of the premiums paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance (the " _Company s Current Premium_"), and if such
premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 200% of the Companys
Current Premium, then the Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Entitys good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to 200% of the Companys Current Premium. The annual amount currently
expended by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such insurance
coverage is set forth in Section 7.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.



(c) The Parent shall pay (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
7.4.



(d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
7.4(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation
described above (each, a " _Claim_ "), shall promptly notify the Parent
thereof; _provided_ that the failure so to notify shall not affect the
obligations of the Parent under Section 7.4(a) unless and to the extent that
the Parent is actually materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. In
the event of a Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and upon such assumption the
Parent shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses
of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof except that
if the Parent elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest between
the Parent and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and the Parent shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements
therefore are received;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent shall be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph (d) to pay for only one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any given
Claim or series of related or similar Claims unless the use of one counsel
for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest that necessitates more than one law firm, (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) the Parent
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Parent shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and non-appealable, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.



 

56 (e) If the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 7.4.



(f) The provisions of this Section 7.4, (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have or contract or otherwise.

form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "),
the Securities Act and the rules of NASDAQ. The Parent agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after
filing thereof. The Parent also agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
obtain, prior to the Effective Time of the Registration Statement, all
necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to

to furnish to the Parent all information concerning the Company, its
officers, directors and shareholders as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the foregoing. The Company shall use all reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders at the
earliest practicable date after the Registration Statement is declared
effective.



(b) Each of the Parent and the Company agrees, as to itself and the Company
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement
thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and (ii) the Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to the Company shareholders,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein

which such statement is made, will be false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, or that will omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier statement in the Proxy Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto. Each of the Parent and the Company further
agrees that if it shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of any
information furnished by it that would cause any of the statements in the
Proxy Statement or Registration Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the
other party thereof and to take necessary steps to correct the Proxy
Statement.



(c) The Parent agrees to advise the Company, promptly after the Parent
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the
issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Parent

threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC
for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for
additional information.

Arrangements, (ii) recognize service of the Continuing Employees which
was credited under the Employee Plans or Benefit Arrangements for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the Parent Employee Plans and

service shall not result in duplicative benefits with respect to the same
period of service, (iii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by any
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement ending on the date
such employees participation in the corresponding Parent Employee Plan or

Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Arrangement for purposes of satisfying all

the Closing and the Shareholder Representative is not authorized by Law to
file such Shareholder Tax Returns Parent shall cause such Shareholder Tax
Returns to be executed and timely filed. The Companys shareholders shall
severally (and not jointly) agree, pursuant to the terms of the letter of
transmittal to be delivered to the Exchange Agent, to satisfy or fulfill their
pro rata share (as determined on a fully diluted basis as of the Closing Date)
the obligations set forth above in the second sentence of this Section
8.3(c).



(d) In the event that any of the Surviving Entity, Shareholder Representative
or Parent receives written notice of any audit by any Tax Authority of Tax
Returns of the Company that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and which

of the Company and not a Tax liability on the Company itself, written notice
of such audit shall be given to the other party, and the Shareholder
Representative shall have (i) the right to assume and control at its sole
cost the defense of the  



 

61  claim by appropriate proceedings with its counsel and (ii) the authority to

if during the audit an issue or claim arises involving more than $70,000 of
Taxes that would be imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any
successor of the foregoing (a " _Company Tax Item_ "), Parent and counsel of
its own choosing shall have the right to participate in the defense of such
Company Tax Item, and without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Shareholder Representative
shall not enter into any settlement of, or otherwise compromise, any such
audit to the extent (i) the audit relates to the Company Tax Item and (ii)
such settlement or compromise would have the effect of subjecting the Company,
a Company Subsidiary, Parent, the Surviving Entity or any successor of the
foregoing to an amount of Tax exceeding $70,000. The Shareholder
Representative shall cooperate with Parent by providing such information with
respect to any settlement or compromise of any audit as is reasonably
necessary for Parent to determine the effect, if any, of such settlement or
compromise on Parent or any of its Affiliates for a taxable period ending
after the Closing Date.



(e) The Parent and the Shareholder Representative agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the businesses of the

necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, and making of any election
related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Tax Authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax
Return. The Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall keep all such
information furnished or caused to be furnished strictly confidential except
(i) the Shareholder Representative may provide copies of such information to
the Companys shareholders, so long as such shareholders agree to keep the
information confidential, (ii) as required by Law and (iii) as reasonably
necessary for the purpose of which the information was furnished or caused to
be furnished. The Shareholder Representative and the Parent shall
cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding
related to Taxes involving the businesses of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and
other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Section
8.3(e). In addition, the Parent agrees to maintain all Tax records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (and all Tax records of the successor
businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries generated during the
three year period following the Closing Date) until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations and the Parent agrees to afford the
Shareholder Representative reasonable access to such records during normal
business hours.



(f) The Shareholder Representative may retain copies of original accounting
and Tax records of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that such copies
shall be subject to the second sentence of Section 8.3(e) to the same extent
as information furnished or caused to be furnished to the Shareholder
Representative pursuant to the first sentence thereof.



(g) Parent shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative a power of attorney
authorizing the Shareholder Representative to act on behalf of the Surviving
Entity with respect to (i) any Shareholder Tax Returns due after the

relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and involves a Tax Liability that would
be imposed directly on the shareholders of the Company.

case as shall be reasonably necessary to enable Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver

inquiry or investigation by any Governmental Entity that is lawfully entitled
to require any such disclosure, such party (the " _Required Party_ ") shall,
so far as it is lawful, notify the other party of such required disclosure on
the same day that the Required Party (1) is notified of a request for such

promptly cause all copies of documents or extracts thereof containing
Information and data as to another party hereto to be returned to the party
that furnished the same. No investigation by either party of the business and

69 (2)(A) the number obtained by dividing the Average NMS Closing Price of Parent
Common Stock by $27.65 is less than (B) the number obtained by dividing the
Final Index Price (as defined below) by the Initial Index Price and then
subtracting 0.175 from the quotient in this clause (i)(2)(B).



For purposes of this Section 12.1(i), the following terms have the meanings
indicated below:



" _Average NMS Closing Price_ " shall mean the arithmetic mean of the NMS
Closing Prices for the ten trading days immediately preceding the
Determination Date.



" _Determination Date_ " means the second Business Day prior to the receipt of
the last Requisite Regulatory Approval (exclusive of the expiration of an
applicable waiting period related to such approval).

Average NMS Closing Price of Parent Common Stock (i.e., the valuation date).



" _Index Group_ " means the 20 financial institution holding companies listed
on _Exhibit E_ attached hereto, the common stock of all of which shall be
publicly traded and as to which there shall not have been a publicly
announced proposal at any time during the period beginning on the date of the

acquired. In the event that the common stock of any such company ceases to
be publicly traded or a proposal to acquire any such company is announced at
any time during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending
on the valuation date, such company will be removed from the Index Group, and
the weights attributed to the remaining companies will be adjusted
proportionately for purposes of determining the Final Index Price and the
Initial Index Price. The 20 financial institution holding companies and the
weights attributed to them are listed on  _Exhibit E_ attached hereto.



" _Initial Index Price_ " means the sum of each per share closing price of
the common stock of each company comprising the Index Group multiplied by the
applicable weighting, as such prices are reported on the consolidated
transactions reporting system for the market or exchange on which such common
stock is principally traded, on January 17, 2006.



" _NMS Closing Price_ " shall mean the price per share of the last sale of
Parent Common Stock reported on the NASDAQ National Market System at the
close of the trading day by the NASD.



Prior to the Company exercising its right of termination under this Section

and (2) are met, the Parent may, at its option (the " _Fill Option_ "), for
a period of five Business Days commencing on the date following  



 

70  the Determination Date, offer to deliver to the Companys shareholders as
additional Merger Consideration, the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock necessary for the Stock Exchange Ratio to equal $96.89 divided by the
Average NMS Closing Price of Parent Common Stock (the " _Fill Offer_ "). In
the event the Parent determines not to exercise the Fill Option, it will so
advise the Company in writing, and thereafter, for a period of two days the
Company may exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 12.1(i). If Parent determines to exercise the Fill Option, the Company
shall accept the Fill Offer and shall no longer be entitled to a right of
termination under this Section 12.1(i).



If the Parent or any company belonging to the Index Group declares or effects
a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of
the Agreement and the valuation date, the prices for the common stock of such
company will be appropriately adjusted.



12.2 _Effect of Termination_.



 

(a) In the event that (i) any Person makes an Acquisition Proposal after the
date of this Agreement that shall have not been withdrawn on the date of the

consummates, an Acquisition Proposal involving any Person or any affiliate

provided non-public information, with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, then the
Company shall pay to the Parent a fee of $14,000,000, which amount shall be
payable by wire transfer of same day funds, in the case of the foregoing
clause (i), (ii) or (iv), within two Business Days after the first to occur of
the execution of the agreement relating to the Acquisition Proposal or
the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, and in the case of clause
(iii), on the date of termination of this Agreement.



(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or the
Parent as provided in Section 12.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no further effect, without any liability or obligation on the
part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, other than the provisions of
Section 8.4, Section 13.1, Section 13.7 and this Section 12.2 and
the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall relieve any party from liability for any willful and material breach of
the warranties and representations made by it, or willful and material failure
in performance of any of its covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the fee specified in Section
12.2(a) is due and payable, Section 12.2(a) is intended by the parties to be,
and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy and shall be in lieu of any and
all claims that the Parent and its officers, directors, partners and
stockholders have, or might have, against the Company and its officers,

13.3 _Assignment_. All terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure, to the extent permitted by Law, to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective permitted transferees and
successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this Agreement and all rights, privileges, duties and obligations of the
parties hereto, without the prior written approval of the other parties
hereto, may not be transferred, assigned or delegated by any party hereto (by
operation of law or otherwise) and any such attempted transfer, assignment or
delegation shall be null and void.



 

73 13.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any exhibit hereto may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which, taken together, shall constitute one
original document and shall become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by the appropriate parties and delivered to each party
hereto.



13.5 _Effect of Representations and Warranties_. The representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall terminate immediately after
the Effective Time.



13.6 _Third Parties_. Each party hereto intends that this Agreement shall not
benefit or create any right or cause of action to any person other than
parties hereto, except as provided in Section 7.4(e) and 8.3(b). As used in
this Agreement the term " _parties_ " shall refer only to the Parent and the
Company as the context may require.



13.7 _Integration_. The Confidentiality Agreement dated October 5, 2005 by and
between the Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), to
the extent the Confidentiality Agreement is not superseded by Section 8.4, and
the Disclosure Letters delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall constitute a part of this Agreement, although
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Shareholders Agreements and the Disclosure
Letters need not be attached to each copy of this Agreement. This Agreement,
together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Shareholders Agreements and
the Disclosure Letters, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings of the parties in connection therewith.



13.8 _Interpretation; Effect_. This Agreement shall be construed
and interpreted fairly as to all parties and not in favor of or against a
party, regardless of which party prepared this Agreement. Words in the
singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa and words of one
gender shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires, the
terms "hereof", "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall,
unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement, and Article, Section and
paragraph references are to the Articles, Sections and paragraphs of this
Agreement unless otherwise specified, and the word "including" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall mean "including, without
limitation", unless otherwise specified. References herein to "transactions
contemplated by this Agreement" include the Merger as well as any other
transactions contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated by the
Shareholders Agreements. All references to "dollars" or "$" mean the lawful
currency of the United States unless otherwise indicated. Any reference in
this Agreement to any Law, rule or regulation shall be deemed to include a
reference to any amendments, revisions or successor provisions to such Law,
rule or regulation.



13.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws
thereof (other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law).



 

74 13.10 _Captions_. The captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only and do not form a part of this Agreement and shall not
affect the interpretation hereof.



13.11 _Severability_. If any portion of this Agreement shall be deemed by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the remaining portions
shall be valid and enforceable only if, after excluding the portion deemed to
be unenforceable, the remaining terms hereof shall provide for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein in substantially the same
manner and with substantially the same effect as originally set forth at the
date this Agreement was executed. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.



13.12 _Waiver and Modification; Amendment_. No waiver of any term, provision
or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed
to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such term,
provision or condition of this Agreement. Except as otherwise required by law,
this Agreement, when executed and delivered, may be modified or amended by
action of the Boards of Directors of the Parent, the Merger Sub and the
Company without action by their respective shareholders. This Agreement may be
modified or amended or any provision hereof waived only by an instrument of
equal formality signed by the parties or their duly authorized agents.



13.13 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and accordingly, each
party agrees that the other party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which the parties are entitled at Law or in equity.



13.14 _Jurisdiction_. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby may be
brought in any federal or state court located in the City of New York, County
of New York, and each of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
13.2 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party; _provided_
that nothing in this Section 13.14 shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. The consent to
jurisdiction set forth in this Section 13.14 shall not constitute a general
consent to service of process in the State of New York and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section 13.14. The parties
hereto agree that final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.



 

75 13.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
