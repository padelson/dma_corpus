and reasonable pre-estimate of the cost and loss that would actually be
suffered by Peabody.

---|---|--- 
      
  13.2  |   | Effect of termination  
      
  (a)  |   | Subject to clause 13.2(b), if this agreement is terminated by
either party under clauses 3.4(b) or 13.1, except to the extent that the
termination results from a breach by either party of its obligations under
this agreement, this agreement will become void and have no effect, without
any liability or obligation on the part of any party, other than in
relation to rights and obligations that accrued prior to termination and
other than in relation to the provisions of this clause 13 and of clauses 6.5
to 6.7, 11, 14.1, 14.2, 15, 16.2, 16.4 and 16.5, which will remain in force

       | (1)  |   | of Peabody in relation to a breach of an Excel
Representation and Warranty, or in relation to a breach of clause 5.1(n), is
its right of termination resulting from the non-satisfaction of the condition
precedent in clause 3.1(g) or clause 3.1(f), as the case may be;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | of Excel in relation to a breach of a Peabody

  14.1  |   | Stamp duty  
      
    |   | Peabody must pay all stamp duties and any fines and penalties

  (a)  |   | Any consideration or amount payable under this agreement,
including any non-monetary consideration (as reduced in accordance with
clause 15(e) if required) (Consideration) is exclusive of GST.  
      
  (b)  |   | If GST is or becomes payable on a Supply made under or in
connection with this agreement, an additional amount (Additional Amount) is
payable by the party providing consideration for the Supply (Recipient) equal
to the amount of GST payable on that Supply as calculated by the party making
the Supply (Supplier) in accordance with the GST Law.  
      
  (c)  |   | The Additional Amount payable under clause 15(b) is payable
at the same time and in the same manner as the Consideration for the Supply,
and the Supplier must provide the Recipient with a Tax Invoice. However, the

  (d)  |   | If for any reason (including the occurrence of an Adjustment

the Recipient, or the Recipient must pay a further amount to the Supplier, as

credit or further amount within 14 days after becoming aware of the variation
to the amount of GST payable. Any refund or credit must accompany such

in relation to the Supply, the requirement for the Supplier to notify the
Recipient will be satisfied by the Supplier issuing to the Recipient an
Adjustment Note within 14 days after becoming aware of the occurrence of the
Adjustment Event.

  5.1  |   | Consideration under the Scheme  
      
    |   | The obligation of Peabody Sub to provide each Scheme

    |   | In the case of Scheme Shares held in joint names the Scheme
Consideration shall be payable to and be forwarded to the holder whose name

     (b)  |   | Excel must register registrable transmission
applications or transfers of the kind referred to in clause 6(a)(2) on the

effect from the Scheme Record Date as documents of title in respect of those

  (f)  |   | As soon as possible after the Scheme Record Date and in any

Peabody reasonably requires.

Corporations Act.  
      
  (b)  |   | On a date after the Implementation Date to be determined by
Peabody, Excel will apply:  
   

  

       | (1)  |   | for termination of the official quotation of
Excel Shares on the ASX; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | to have itself removed from the official list of the

attorney and agent (and directed Peabody Sub in such capacity) to appoint an
officer or agent nominated by Peabody as its sole proxy and, where
applicable, corporate representatives to attend shareholders meetings,
exercise the votes attaching to the Scheme Shares registered in their name
and sign any shareholders resolutions, whether in person, by proxy or
by corporate representative (other than as pursuant to this clause 8.6(a));
