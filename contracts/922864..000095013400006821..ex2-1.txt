flows for calendar year 2000 of the Acquired Assets shown on Disclosure Schedule
2.3(a) (except in the case of James-Oxford Limited Partnership ("James"), in
which case the fiscal year ending May 31, 2001 shall be used in lieu of calendar
year 2000) that results from the occurrence during the period following January
1, 2000 (June 1, 2000, in the case of James) through and including the Closing
Date of any of the following events: (i) any equity restructurings, mortgage or
refinancing transaction, or payment or repayment, as the case may be, of any
Partnership Receivables, (ii) if all or any material portion of any of the

pending taking which has not been consummated) or if a material portion of any
Property is damaged or destroyed by earthquake, flood, landslide, fire or other
casualty which materially adversely affects the current and future operations of
such Property and for which no proceeds are payable either by the applicable
Governmental Authority or insurer, (iii) to the extent that any Acquired Asset
is not transferred to Buyers at the Closing, or (iv) without duplication and/or
except to the extent otherwise provided herein, to the extent that the Sellers
or Sellers' Affiliates amend, modify, terminate or enter into any agreements or
Organizational Documents which affect the total projected net cash flows for
calendar year 2000 of the Acquired Assets shown on Disclosure Schedule 2.3(a)
(except in the case of James, in which case the fiscal year ending May 30, 2001
shall be used in lieu of calendar year 2000). Sellers shall in good faith
propose the amount of the appropriate adjustment to the projected net cash flow
for calendar year 2000 (except in the case of James, which shall utilize a
fiscal year ending May 30, 2001) by preparing a pro forma schedule of net cash
flows for calendar year 2000 (except in the case of James, which shall utilize a
fiscal year ending June 30) similar to the schedule set forth on Disclosure
Schedule 2.3(a), and using the same methodology and assumptions used to prepare
such schedule, except that the net cash flows shall be adjusted to reflect the
occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (a) above as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2000 (June 1, 2000 in the case of James). The aggregate
increase or decrease in the sum of total projected net cash flows for calendar
year 2000 (the fiscal year ending May 31, 2001 in the case of James) shall be
multiplied by 8.6 to determine the amount of the adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

deliver to Buyers proposed adjustments, if any, to the Purchase Price allocable
to each of the Acquired Assets identified on Disclosure Schedule 2.1 that are
required pursuant to this Section 2.3, together with reasonably detailed
supporting documentation for each such adjustment.

          (c) The Purchase Price and the cash portion payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(b) shall be increased at Closing by the cash balance of OHC and ORFG
at Closing computed in accordance with the methodology shown on Disclosure
Schedule 2.3(c), as adjusted to the actual date of Closing as follows: (i)
reduced to reflect (aa) payments or reserves for accrued but unpaid


                                       19
<PAGE>   28

operating expenses (other than Taxes) through and including the Closing Date,
(bb) all Tax liabilities of such entities attributable to income, gain or loss
recognized through the Closing Date for federal, state and/or local income tax
purposes in excess of available tax attributes (net of any estimated tax
payments by such entities) determined as if the taxable year of such entity
ended on the Closing Date, and (ii) increased by accrued but unpaid revenues and
receipts due Sellers and Sellers' Affiliates through and including the Closing
Date.

          (d) The Purchase Price and the cash portion payable pursuant to

Bank, Boston, Massachusetts, Account # 936428- 7162, which has a balance of
approximately $515,000 as of the date hereof, increased by any additional
deposits made by any of the Companies after the date hereof and any interest
earned on such amounts, decreased by any Shortfalls for the portion of calendar
year 2000 ending on the closing date, as defined in the Oxford Group Cash Escrow

documents as may be required to terminate the Cash Escrow Account Agreement and
Income Tax Cash Escrow Agreement, by and between certain Oxford companies and
certain predecessors-in-interest to AIMCO, each dated as of December 10, 1993
(collectively, the "Oxford Group Escrow Termination Agreement").

          (e) The Purchase Price and the cash portion payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(b) shall be increased at Closing by a per diem amount equal to
$36,000 per day for each day that the Closing occurs subsequent to June 30,
2000; provided, however, per diem amounts attributable to those Acquired Assets
that are sold or transferred to persons or which were damaged or condemned in
whole or in part prior to the Closing and/or to those Acquired Assets which will
not be transferred at Closing (e.g., because they are subject to the Closing
Escrow Agreement or will be transferred on a subsequent Closing Date) shall be
deducted on a per Acquired Asset basis as set forth in Disclosure Schedule
2.3(e) from such total per diem purchase price adjustment amount.

          (f) Any prorations and payments shall be made on the basis of a
written closing statement approved by Buyers and Sellers. In the event any
prorations or apportionments prove to be incorrect for any reason, then any
party shall be entitled to such adjustments as may be reasonably necessary to
correct the same. Any item which cannot be finally prorated because of the
unavailability of information shall be tentatively prorated on the basis of the
best data then available and re-prorated when the information is available. The
parties hereto agree to furnish each other with such documents and other records
as shall reasonably be requested to confirm all proration calculations and other
payments due under this Section.

          (g) Any re-proration made pursuant to Section 2.3(f) shall be made, if
at all, within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, except with respect to
Taxes which shall be re- prorated within thirty (30) days after the information
necessary to perform such re-proration is available.

written notice, then Buyers shall receive a credit at Closing against the cash
portion of the Purchase Price in an amount equal to the Sellers' allocable share
of any up-front payment or other non-monetary consideration (e.g., warrants or
options issued by the vendor) which they receive from third party service
providers.

          (i) In the event a Property is sold or refinanced by a Property-Owning
Entity subsequent to the date hereof and prior to Closing, Buyers shall receive

equal to any net proceeds received by Sellers, Sellers' Affiliates, ORFG and/or
OHC from such sale or refinancing.

          (j) The cash portion of the Purchase Price shall be reduced, without
duplication for any such amounts otherwise adjusted under this Section 2.3, by
the amount of any dividend or distribution paid to or received by a Seller or
Seller's Affiliate attributable to any Acquired Asset and relating to or arising
from recurring operations that occur after January 1, 2000 (or May 30, 2000 in
the case of James) provided, however, that such reduction shall not apply to
dividends or distributions of Excluded Assets. Sellers shall, at the Closing,
provide Buyers with a certification of the amount of any such dividends or
distributions.

          (k) Sellers shall in good faith determine the amount of the
adjustments set forth above and shall provide Buyers with a written notice of
adjustment, together with a reasonably detailed calculation of such amounts, at
least fifteen (15) days before the Closing Date. Buyers shall, at Buyers'
expense, have the right to audit the adjustments proposed by Sellers and to
inspect the books and records of each of the Oxford Entities relating to the
same. In the event Buyers dispute the amount of the adjustment, Buyers shall,
within five (5) days of receipt of the notice of adjustment, provide to Sellers
a written notice of dispute, together with a reasonably detailed explanation of
the nature of the dispute. If, within three (3) days following Sellers' receipt
of any notice of dispute, the parties are unable to agree upon the amount of any
adjustment required pursuant to this Section, each party shall immediately
select a firm of independent certified public accountants to resolve the
discrepancy, and shall notify the other party in writing as to the identity of
the accounting firm and date of selection. Should the two accounting firms be
unable to reach agreement on the amount of the adjustment within five (5) days
following the date of their selection, they shall immediately jointly designate
a third firm of independent certified public accountants, and the adjustments to
the Purchase Price shall be the mathematical average of the amount of adjustment
determined by each of the three firms so selected. This determination shall be
final and binding upon all the parties hereto, and shall be enforceable in a
court of competent jurisdiction.

          (l) Any adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made pro rata among
the portion of the Purchase Price that will be paid in AIMCO Stock, OP Units,
and cash pursuant to Section 2.2, except to the extent otherwise provided
herein.

          (m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the
event the Actual AIMCO Market Price, using a Determination Date as of the date
immediately preceding the Closing Date, is less than $35 per share, the Purchase
Price which Sellers shall be entitled to receive under Section 2.2 shall be
increased by an amount equal to the product of (y) the difference between $35
and the Actual AIMCO Market Price (using a Determination Date as of the date
immediately preceding the Closing Date), multiplied by (x) 1,500,000 (which
number shall be proportionally adjusted in the event that the aggregate
contribution value for the Contributed Assets is other than $60,000,000), which
amount may, at Buyers' election, be paid by wire transfer of good and
immediately available funds pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or the delivery of
additional AIMCO Shares, based upon the Actual AIMCO Market Price, using a
Determination Date as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date.

          (n) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted in accordance with the terms
of Section 4.1(c).

     2.4. Warrants. On the Closing Date, the warrants for 500,000 shares of
AIMCO stock currently held by Sellers shall be amended and restated pursuant to
a warrant agreement in the form of the Amended and Restated Warrant Agreement.

     2.5. Deposit.

          (a) On the date hereof, Buyers shall pay to Sellers the sum of Five
Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000), representing a nonrefundable
payment which will be retained by Sellers in all events; provided that this
amount will be applied toward the Purchase Price in the event a Closing occurs.
In addition, on the date hereof, Buyers shall either deposit an additional Five
Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/Dollars ($5,500,000) in cash payable by
wire transfer of good and immediately available U.S. funds (which, at Buyers'
option, may be replaced by a Letter of Credit as described in clause (c) below)
or deliver a Letter of Credit as described in clause (c) below (such amount
deposited, together with all interest accrued thereon, or Letter of Credit is
hereinafter referred to and held as the "Deposit") with or to the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

          (b) Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit and make delivery of the
Deposit to the party entitled thereto under the terms of this Agreement. If the
Deposit is made by Buyers other than by Letter of Credit, Escrow Agent shall
invest the Deposit in an interest-bearing bank account or money market fund or
such other short-term, investment grade securities as Sellers and Buyers shall
jointly agree, in writing, with such agreement being provided to Escrow Agent in
writing. The taxpayer identification number of one of the Buyers shall initially
be utilized for purposes of establishing the interest-bearing escrow account for
the Deposit and such Buyer shall be allocated such interest income for income
tax purposes; provided, however, the interest earned on the Deposit shall
ultimately be reported by the party entitled to receive the Deposit in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.


                                       22
<PAGE>   31

          (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the
event that the Deposit is delivered in the form of (or replaced by) a Letter of
Credit:

               (i) Escrow Agent shall draw on the Letter of Credit on the
          Business Day immediately preceding any date on which Escrow Agent is
          required to disburse all or any portion of the Deposit pursuant to the
          terms of this Agreement.

               (ii) The amount of any Letter of Credit shall equal $5,500,000
          plus an amount equal to the interest that would accrue thereon for a
          three month period at 5% per annum and, if drawn, shall be held in
          escrow pending disbursement by Escrow Agent.

               (iii) Escrow Agent shall draw on the entire stated amount of the
          Letter of Credit on the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the
          expiration date thereof, unless on or before such date, Buyers deliver
          to Escrow Agent either (a) an extension of the Letter of Credit or (b)
          an amount of cash equal to the entire stated amount of the Letter of
          Credit.

               (iv) Buyers shall pay all costs and expenses relating to the
          Letter of Credit.

          (d) On the Closing Date, monies held as the Deposit, together with the
Non- Refundable Payments, together with deemed interest on the Non-Refundable
Payments at the rate of 5% per annum from the date of the Agreement through the
Closing Date, shall be applied to the cash portion of the Purchase Price payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(b).

     2.6. Escrow.

          (a) The parties agree that the Deposit shall be returned to Buyers or
delivered to Sellers in accordance with the provisions of Article X.

          (b) In the event any party notifies the Escrow Agent in writing that a
dispute has arisen with regard to the delivery of the Deposit, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver the Deposit only pursuant to a joint written instruction from all
of the parties. If the Escrow Agent does not receive a joint written instruction
from all of the parties regarding the Deposit within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice the Escrow Agent shall have the following rights: (i) the
Escrow Agent may, upon giving written notice to the parties hereto, place the
Deposit with the clerk of the court for the state in which litigation, if any,
between or among the parties hereto in connection with the Deposit is pending in
accordance with the requirements of Section 12.20 of this Agreement; (ii) the
Escrow Agent may, upon giving written notice to the parties hereto, take such
affirmative steps as the Escrow Agent may, at its option, elect in order to
terminate its duties as Escrow Agent, including placing the Deposit with a court
of competent jurisdiction, determined in accordance with Section 12.20, and
commencing an action for interpleader (the parties hereto agreeing that such
commencement of any action for interpleader shall terminate the duties of the
Escrow Agent


                                       23

hereunder), the costs thereof (including reasonable attorneys' fees) (to be
borne by whichever of the parties hereto is the losing party. Upon the taking by
the Escrow Agent of either of the actions described in clause (i) or (ii) above,
the Escrow Agent shall be released of and discharged from any further
obligations.

          (c) If the Escrow Agent receives written instructions to cancel the
escrow from all of the parties, the instructions set forth above shall be deemed
canceled, the Escrow Agent shall immediately notify the other parties of its
receipt of same and the Escrow Agent shall immediately (i) release the Deposit
to Buyers; and (ii) return each of the documents to party depositing same.

          (d) The parties hereto agree that the Escrow Agent is acting solely as
escrow closing agent, and shall be liable solely for its failure to comply with
the terms of this Agreement by reason of its willful misconduct or gross
negligence. The foregoing will not limit the liability of Escrow Agent as title
insurer, if any, under the terms of any owner's or lender's policy of title
insurance which the Escrow Agent or its affiliates may issue (such liability
being in accordance with the terms of such policy).

          (e) In all events and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Sellers shall be entitled to retain the Non-Refundable
Payments.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                           PRE-CLOSING REORGANIZATIONS

     3.1. Restructurings. On or before the Closing Date, the reorganizations and

     4.1. Closing.

          (a) Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by the
party benefiting from such conditions) of all conditions to Closing set forth in
this Agreement with respect to Acquired Assets representing at least ninety-five
percent (95%) of the aggregate projected net cash flow shown on Disclosure
Schedule 2.3(a), the Closing shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight
Time, on July 28, 2000, at the offices of Hale and Dorr LLP, 1455 Pennsylvania
Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20004; provided that, except as set forth in
Section 4.1(b), if all such conditions to Closing have not been or cannot be
satisfied or are not waived by such date by the party benefiting from such
conditions, (i) either party shall have the right to extend the Closing Date for
up to six, successive one-month periods by delivery of written notice to the
other party of the exercise of such right at least three business days prior to
July 28, 2000 or the end of any such


                                       24
<PAGE>   33

subsequent extension; (ii) the party issuing the extension notice must be
exercising commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy all conditions to Closing
in a timely manner; (iii) in the event of each one-month extension of the
Closing Date, the Closing Date shall occur on the 29th day of the immediately
following month (or the next Business Day following the 29th day of such month),
and (iv) if the Closing has not been completed for any reason whatsoever by
January 29, 2001, this Agreement shall be null and void and of no force or
effect as though it had never been executed and neither party shall have any
liability or obligation to the other party except as otherwise provided herein;
provided, however, if Closing is scheduled to occur in December 2000, Sellers
shall have the right, upon delivery of written notice to Buyers, to postpone the
Closing Date until January 29, 2001.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section
4.1(a), above, in the event that at any time after the Tentative HUD Approval
Date, all conditions to Closing other than the HUD Condition (the "Non-HUD
Conditions") have been satisfied or waived by the party benefiting from such
condition, but the HUD Condition has not been satisfied, then this Agreement and
each Related Document shall be null and void and of no force or effect as though
it had never been executed, the Deposit shall be returned to Buyers, and neither
party shall have any liability or obligation to the other party except as
otherwise provided herein or in such Related Document; provided, however, in the
event that on the Tentative HUD Approval Date all of the Non-HUD Conditions have
been satisfied or waived by the party benefiting from such condition, Buyers
shall have the right to extend the Closing Date to a date after the Tentative
HUD Approval Date for up to six, successive one-month periods after the the

the exercise of such right at least three business days prior to the date this
Agreement would otherwise terminate, or the end of any such subsequent

good and immediately available U.S. funds to such account as may be specified
within ten (10) days after the Effective Date by Sellers or if not so specified
by cashier's check, provided, however, that if the Tentative HUD Approval Date
is the 100th day following the Effective Date, the initial one month period
shall be decreased to a twenty (20) day period. In the event Closing shall occur
hereunder, each Non-Refundable Payment shall be applied to the cash portion of
the Purchase Price payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b). In the event Closing
shall not occur hereunder, each Non-Refundable Payment shall be retained by
Sellers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyers shall
only have the right to extend the Closing beyond January 29, 2001 for failure to
satisfy the HUD Condition if the Non- HUD Conditions have been satisfied or
waived, with respect to Acquired Assets representing at least ninety-five
percent (95%) of the aggregate projected net cash flow shown on Disclosure
Schedule 2.3(a), on or before January 29, 2001. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 4.1(b) and for purposes of this Section 4.1(b) only,
if the Seller Required Consents have been obtained or waived by Sellers, the
Buyer Required Consents shall be deemed to have been obtained or waived.

          (c) At Closing, with respect to each of the Acquired Assets for which
all conditions to Closing have not been satisfied, such Acquired Assets and each
of the closing delivery items identified in Section 4.4 and Section 4.5 relating
to such Acquired Assets shall be delivered

Escrow") pending the satisfaction of all remaining conditions to Closing with
respect thereto (provided, however, that Buyers shall be entitled to deposit OP
Units in lieu of AIMCO Stock for AIMCO Stock which would otherwise be issued to
Sellers):

               (i) Sellers shall be entitled to continue to receive their
          allocable portion of all of the net cash flow and other distributions
          attributable to Acquired Assets which are the subject of the Closing
          Escrow and which are accrued and/or relate to the period of time such
          Acquired Asset(s) are subject to the Closing Escrow;

               (ii) Sellers shall retain all voting, control and management
          rights relating to any of the Acquired Assets which are the subject of
          the Closing Escrow, as provided in Section 4.3, including without
          limitation the sole and exclusive right to sell or refinance the
          related Properties, and to determine the timing and amount of
          distributions to direct or indirect partners of the related
          Property-Owning Entities,

               (iii) Buyers shall be entitled to receive all of the income
          generated by their cash placed in escrow and/or Buyers shall be
          entitled to retain all amounts which would otherwise be distributable
          with respect to Buyers' Securities that are placed in escrow which
          would otherwise be issued to Sellers,

               (iv) With respect to any assets or interests subject to the
          Closing Agreement, for so long as any such interests or assets remain
          subject to the Closing Escrow, Buyers shall not offer to acquire or
          make any offer to acquire the interests of any of the limited
          partners, special limited partners, holders of assignee units or
          beneficial assignee interests of Property-Owning Entities, Employee
          Partnerships or the Investment Tier Partnerships, ORP or OTEF, as the
          case may be, or otherwise solicit any of the foregoing interest
          holders with respect to any transaction or proposed transaction
          involving a sale, contribution, exchange, purchase, repurchase or
          redemption, tender offer, merger, reorganization, spin-off,
          consolidation, business combination or similar type of transaction of
          such assets or interests while the same remain subject to the Closing
          Escrow,

               (v) With respect to Properties relating to any assets or
          interests subject to the Closing Escrow, for so long as such interests
          or assets remain subject to the Closing Escrow, the operational and
          accounting services provided by Manager on the date hereof will
          continue to be performed by employees of Manager who are primarily
          dedicated to such Properties as a group and, in addition, a
          senior-level officer of Manager (or Buyers or Buyers' Affiliates) will
          have primary supervisory responsibility with respect to such
          Properties,

               (vi) With respect to Properties relating to any assets or
          interests subject to the Closing Escrow, Buyers shall cause ORFG or
          another Buyer Affiliate to continue


                                       26

          partnership and other agreements in exchange for the fees payable
          pursuant to such agreements, including without limitation, investor
          reporting and related tax services, and

               (vii) Prior to the date or dates on which assets or interests are
          released from the Closing Escrow (each an "Escrow Release Date"), a
          determination shall be made, pursuant to the provisions of Section
          2.3, as to any appropriate adjustments to the Purchase Price allocable
          to such interests or assets as of the Escrow Release Date as if the
          Escrow Release Date were the Closing Date. Subject to the foregoing,
          on the Escrow Release Date, among other things, (a) Buyers shall
          deliver an amount equal to increase in the Purchase Price (if any) for
          the released assets and interests to Sellers (in the same proportions
          of cash and Buyers' Securities as the Purchase Price allocable to the
          assets being released), and (b) Escrow Agent shall return to Buyers
          the decrease (if any) in the Purchase Price for the released assets
          and interests (in the same proportions of cash and Buyers' Securities
          as the Purchase Price allocable to the assets being released). In
          addition, on the Escrow Release Date, all closing delivery items
          related to the released assets or interests shall be released from
          escrow in the order and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, but
          as if the Escrow Release Date were the Closing Date; provided,
          however, Buyers shall substitute AIMCO Stock for OP Units to the
          extent Sellers elect to receive AIMCO Stock for the Acquired Asset
          being released from escrow.

               (viii) In the event all conditions to Closing have not been
          satisfied or waived with respect to all escrowed assets and interests
          on or before December 31, 2001 or such later date pursuant to the
          extensions permitted in Section 4.1, then: (i) all documents,
          securities, funds and other items deposited pursuant to the Closing
          Escrow shall, without further action of any party, be promptly
          returned to the party or parties who deposited such items, (ii) the
          escrow shall be deemed to have terminated, and (iii) neither Sellers
          nor Buyers shall have any obligation to sell or contribute, acquire or
          accept, as the case may be, any or all of the Acquired Assets subject
          to the Closing Escrow immediately prior to such termination and (iv)
          the parties shall have no further rights, obligations or liabilities
          regarding such assets.

                                    COVENANTS

     8.1. Notification of Certain Matters. Subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement executed between Buyers and Sellers and any applicable
Laws, the Sellers shall give prompt notice to the Buyers (but in no event more
than 2 days after receipt) of any written offer to purchase or acquire any of
the Acquired Assets or Acquired Business. Subject to Section 10.1, the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

     8.2. Consents and Approvals.

          (a) Sellers shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the consents and approvals of Persons who hold mortgage loans secured by any of
the Properties, or a financial institution that has provided credit enhancement
for all or a portion of such debt or tax-exempt bonds relating thereto which
Sellers and Buyers believe may be required in connection with this transaction
(the "Consents"), which shall mean, except in the context of Required Consents,
notifying those


                                       51
<PAGE>   60

Persons who or which Sellers and Buyers believe may be required to provide
consent or approval in connection with this transaction, and (ii) take, or cause
to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
without limitation, using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, certificates,
qualifications and orders of, and make all filings and required submissions
with, all Governmental Authorities, and all shareholders, lenders and partners
of, and parties to contracts with, any of Buyers, Sellers or the Companies and
all other Persons, in each case, as are necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, neither
Sellers nor Sellers' counsel shall be required to deliver legal opinions to such
lenders. Sellers shall, as soon as possible prior to the Closing, deliver to
Buyers copies of all Consents obtained by Sellers. Any and all fees, costs,
expenses, fines, penalties, settlements or other amounts required to be paid in
connection with or incidental to obtaining any of the Consents shall be paid by
Sellers, provided that Sellers shall not be required to expend in excess of
$750,000 in the aggregate in connection therewith; provided further that Sellers
shall not pay any fees, costs, etc. in connection with obtaining the HUD
Approval.

          (b) Within five (5) days of the date of this Agreement, Sellers and
Buyers shall submit a written summary to HUD Central Office in Washington, D.C.
describing the transactions provided for in this Agreement. The parties shall
then jointly meet with appropriate officials at HUD Central Office.

          (c) Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this Agreement, Buyers
shall prepare and submit to HUD a Form 2530 as necessary in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "2530 Approval"). Buyers and Sellers shall
cooperate with each other and with HUD and provide to HUD all information
reasonably requested by HUD in connection with its consideration of the Form
2530. Although the parties do not believe an application for either a full or
modified application for transfer of physical assets ("TPA Application") is
required to be filed with respect to any HUD Partnership, in the event that the
HUD central office or any other HUD office requires the submission of a TPA
Application, Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate in the preparation and
submission of the TPA Application. For purposes of this subsection, HUD shall
not include any state finance housing agency. Buyers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain 2530 Approval and, if necessary, approval of TPA
Applications (as applicable, the "HUD Approvals") and shall pay any and all
fees, costs, expenses or other similar amounts required to be paid in connection
with or incidental to obtaining the HUD Approvals; provided that Buyers shall
not be required to expend in excess of $750,000 in the aggregate in connection
therewith. Buyers shall promptly notify Sellers of any issues or matters raised
in connection with obtaining the HUD Approvals, and Buyers shall provide to
Sellers copies of all correspondence between Buyers or their Representatives and
HUD regarding the HUD Approvals.

     8.3. Conduct of Business Pending the Closing. From the date hereof through
the Closing, except as expressly permitted or contemplated by this Agreement,
unless AIMCO shall otherwise agree in writing prior to the taking of any action
prohibited by the terms of this Section, Sellers shall


                                       52
<PAGE>   61

cause each of the Oxford Entities to conduct its operations and business in the
ordinary and usual course of business and consistent with past practice.

     8.4. Sale of Acquired Assets. From and after the date hereof, Sellers shall
not sell, transfer, hypothecate, pledge or encumber any of the Acquired Assets
or agree to sell, transfer, hypothecate, pledge or encumber any of the Acquired
Assets, other than to Buyers (or their designee), except to the extent required
(in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices) in
connection with the financing or refinancing of any debt or credit facility
relating to any of the Companies, Property-Owning Entities, OTEF or ORP;
provided, however, that any sale, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or encumbrance
shall not affect the obligation of Sellers to transfer any Acquired Asset which
has changed in legal form from the original Acquired Asset as a result of such
sale, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or encumbrance.

     8.5. Access and Investigation.

          (a) Prior to the termination of this Agreement, subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Oxford
Entities and their Representatives to, provide Buyers and their Representatives
with full and free access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to the Oxford Entities' personnel, properties, contracts, books and
records and other documents and data, including tax returns, and shall furnish
Buyers with copies of all documents and with such additional financial and
operating data and other information as Buyers shall, from time to time,
reasonably request for the purpose of enabling Buyers to investigate the affairs
of the Oxford Entities and the Acquired Business and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Sellers made in this Agreement. During such
investigation, subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, Buyers and
their Representatives shall have the right to make copies of such contracts,
books and records, tax returns and other documents and data as they may deem
advisable. Buyers shall endeavor not to unreasonably disrupt the business or
operations of Sellers or the Oxford Entities.

          (b) Buyers and their Representatives shall be entitled, upon
reasonable notice to Sellers, to cause one or more Phase I environmental site
assessments of the Properties (each, an "Environmental Assessment") to be
performed, at Buyers' expense. Each Environmental Assessment may include any and
all investigations that Buyers deem appropriate for assessing the environmental
condition of and any potential environmental liabilities associated with the
Properties. Sellers shall provide Buyers and their Representatives with full
access to the Properties, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, and shall not interfere with any Environmental Assessment, and shall
provide all necessary information that is in Sellers' possession or control that
may be necessary or desirable for each Environmental Assessment. Buyers shall
indemnify Sellers and the Companies for any Damages to the Properties as a
result of such Environmental Assessments. No Phase II environmental site
assessment shall be undertaken without the prior written approval of Sellers.

     8.6. No Negotiations with Third Parties. Sellers shall not, and shall not
permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting for or on behalf
of any of them to, solicit, entertain offers


                                       53
<PAGE>   62

any proposal with, to or from a Person not Affiliated with any of Sellers other
than Buyers relating to (a) the sale of all or any part of the Acquired
Business, the Companies or any interest therein, (b) the merger, consolidation
or other combination of the Companies with any Person, or (c) the liquidation,
dissolution or reorganization of the Companies, except (i) with respect to OTEF,
ORP and the Property-Owning Entities, or (ii) to the extent that Sellers'
failure to do so would, in the reasonable opinion of Sellers, constitute a
breach of Sellers' fiduciary duties; provided that this Section is not intended
to prevent, affect or otherwise limit the ability of Sellers to consummate any
transactions involving a financing or refinancing of any debt or credit facility
relating to any of the Oxford Entities, or sale of the Properties owned by the
Property-Owning Entities, provided, further, that any such merger,
consolidation, combination, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization shall not
affect the obligation of Sellers to transfer any Acquired Asset or beneficial
interests represented thereby, including if the same has changed in legal form
from the original Acquired Asset or the Acquired Business as a result of such
merger, consolidation, combination, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization.

     8.7. Public Announcements. At all times at or before the Closing, none of
Buyers or Sellers shall issue or make, directly or indirectly, any reports,
statements or releases to the public with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of AIMCO and
ORFG, on behalf of the Sellers; provided, however, that each of Buyers and
Sellers (a) may issue or make, directly or indirectly, any report, statement or
release required by Law, or the rules of the SEC, or in the case of Buyers, the
New York Stock Exchange or, in the case of Sellers, the American Stock Exchange,

Buyers or the Companies will make COBRA continuation coverage available to
individuals who are employees of ORFG Operations, L.L.C. as of the Closing Date
and are eligible for COBRA continuation coverage pursuant to the terms of their
employment and applicable law. Buyers shall bear the cost of administering such

thereof, as applicable) by such third party exceeds the Purchase Price set forth
herein for such Acquired Assets (or portion thereof, as applicable), or (y)
sell, or cause to be sold, one or more of the Acquired Assets or Properties but
not substantially all of the Acquired Assets or


                                       60
<PAGE>   69

Properties on or before December 31, 2001, to a Person other than Buyers or
their Affiliates, Buyers shall be entitled (in addition to the remedies set
forth in Section 10.3(a)(i) and (ii), above) to damages equal to the amount, if
any, of each Sellers' allocable share of the total purchase price for such
assets; provided that, in either case, the damages shall be payable by each
Seller to Buyers when, in the same manner (whether cash, securities or notes),
and to the extent the purchase price is paid by the third party purchaser to
each Sellers or Seller's assignee, designee or nominee.

          (b) Sellers' Remedies: If Buyers fail or refuse to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any reason, except (x) default
by Sellers of any of their material obligations, (y) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to any applicable provision of this Agreement other than as a
result of a material breach of this Agreement by Buyers, or (z) the failure of
any condition precedent to Buyers' obligation to close set forth in Section 9.1
or 9.2 under this Agreement, then, following written notice by Sellers and a
cure period of twenty (20) business days, which cure is not made, Sellers may,
as their sole and exclusive remedies, hereby waiving all other remedies:

              (i) enforce specific performance of this Agreement against
Buyers; or

              (ii) terminate this Agreement by delivery of written notice to
Sellers and demand and retain, as full and complete liquidated damages, and not
as a penalty, the Deposit, both parties hereto agreeing that it would
speculative or impossible to determine Sellers' actual damages.

          (c) Agreement as to Equitable Remedies. The parties hereto agree that
it may be impossible to calculate the amount of monetary damages that would be
incurred by either party due to a failure of the other party to close hereunder
because of, among other things, (i) the adverse impact which Buyers' failure to
close would have on the Acquired Assets and the Acquired Business, (ii) the
unique nature of the Acquired Assets and the Acquired Business, and (iii) the
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is the acquisition of real
estate and real estate-related interests.

     10.4. Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the Closing:

          (a) AIMCO, on behalf of Buyers, may extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of Seller, and Zickler, on behalf
of Sellers, may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
acts of Buyers;

          (b) AIMCO, on behalf of Buyers, may waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of Sellers contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and Zickler, on behalf of Sellers may waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Buyers contained herein or
in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

          (c) AIMCO, on behalf of Buyers, may waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of Sellers, contained herein, and the Sellers by
unanimous written consent may do the same with respect to Buyers; provided,
however, that no failure or delay by any party


                                       61
<PAGE>   70

in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XI.
                             SELLER LIABILITY LIMITS

     11.1. Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement, or any other document, instrument or agreement executed or delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, the liability of each Seller to Buyers for any act
or omission to act, fact, matter, thing, event or occurrence, obligation or
liability whatsoever relating in any way to, or arising from, this Agreement or
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited
to, the representations and warranties set forth in Articles V and VI or in any
Related Document, covenants set forth in Article VIII or in any Related
Document, and indemnifications set forth in the Indemnification Agreement, shall
be expressly limited as follows:

          (a) Article VI Floor and Cap: With respect to any liability or
obligation of any Seller that relates to a breach of the representations and
warranties made by such Seller pursuant to Article VI of this Agreement, the
following provisions apply:

              (i) Buyers shall not assert any claim, or file or commence any
action, suit, proceeding or arbitration against any Seller unless and until the
liability or obligation of such Seller equals or exceeds an amount equal to (aa)
Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) plus the amount of insurance proceeds paid to
Buyers within 120 days from the date the claim is filed (or to which Sellers or
Buyers receive notice within such time period that payment will be made)
("Sellers' Threshold Amount"), multiplied by (bb) his Ratable Percentage set
forth on Disclosure Schedule 11.1; provided that in the event the liability or
obligation exceeds the foregoing floor amount, Buyers may assert the full amount
of the claim (in excess of amounts paid, or to which Sellers or Buyers receive
notice within such period that payment will be made, pursuant to applicable
insurance policies) from the first dollar of such claim; and

              (ii) In no event shall any Seller be responsible for paying any
liability, obligation or other amount relating to a breach of representations
and warranties made by such Seller pursuant to Article VI to the extent such
amount exceeds such Seller's Maximum Article VI Liability Cap.

          (b) Non-Article VI Floor and Cap:

              (i) Buyers shall not assert any claim, or file or otherwise
commence any action, suit, proceeding or arbitration against any Seller with
respect to any matter arising from or relating to this Agreement or any Related
Document or in connection with closing any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, other than a breach of any representation or warranty made


                                       62
<PAGE>   71

pursuant to Article VI, unless and until the liability or obligation of such
claim equals or exceeds an amount equal to (aa) Three Million Dollars
($3,000,000) plus the amount of any insurance proceeds paid to Buyers within 120
days from the date the claim is filed (or to which Sellers or Buyers receive
notice within such time frame that payment will be made), multiplied by (bb) his
Ratable Percentage set forth on Disclosure Schedule 11.1; provided that in the
event the liability or obligation exceeds the foregoing floor amount, Buyers may
assert the full amount of the claim (in excess of amounts paid, or to which
Sellers or Buyers receive notice within such time period that payment will be
made pursuant to applicable insurance policies) from the first dollar of such
claim; and

              (ii) Each Seller shall only be responsible for paying any
liability, obligation or other amount with respect to any matter arising from or
relating to this Agreement or Related Documents, other than a breach of
representations and warranties made by such Seller pursuant to Article VI for
which the Sellers' Maximum Liability Cap is set forth in (a)(ii) above, in an
amount equal to such Non-Article VI Liability multiplied by his Ratable
Percentage; provided that no Seller shall be liable to the extent such amount
exceeds such Seller's Maximum Non-Article VI Liability Cap.

          (c) The Sellers Maximum Article VI Liability Cap and Maximum Non
Article VI Liability Cap are referred to in Section 4 of the Indemnification
Agreement as the "Applicable Sellers' Cap." Where an indemnity is subject to an
Applicable Sellers' Cap, reference shall be made to Section 11(a) or (b) of this
Agreement to determine the specific Applicable Sellers' Cap which shall apply.

          (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on liability or the
Applicable Sellers' Cap, Sellers shall be responsible for paying any and all
liabilities, obligations, and other amounts arising from or relating to (i)
clauses 4 and 5 of Exhibit A of the Indemnification Agreement, (ii) a failure to
close, as specified in Section 10.3(a)(iii), (iii) pursuant to Section 8.10(ii),
and (iv) with respect to matters addressed in the Tax Matters Agreement (which
shall be governed by the limits on liability set forth therein); provided that
any Seller's liability under Sections 11.1(d)(i), (ii) and (iii) shall not
exceed the amount of such liability multiplied by his Ratable Percentage set
forth on Disclosure Schedule 11.1.

          (e) Any amounts paid by any Seller as damages or pursuant to an
indemnification, including but not limited to amounts paid for breach of
representations and warranties, shall be counted against the floor amounts set
forth in Sections 11.1(a) or (b), as the case may be.

     11.2. As-is Condition.

          (a) Except for the Agreed Representations and Warranties (as defined
below), neither Sellers, nor anyone acting for, or on behalf of Sellers, has
made any representations, warranty, promise or statement, express or implied, to
Buyers, or to anyone acting for or on behalf of Buyers, and Buyers shall be
deemed to have agreed, and hereby do agree, to purchase the Acquired Business in
an "as is, where is" condition and "with all faults" in all respects, and
without


                                       63
<PAGE>   72

warranty or representation, express or implied, by Sellers. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Agreed Representations and Warranties" shall mean those
representations and warranties of Sellers which are specifically set forth in
this Agreement and/or in the documents to be delivered by Sellers at Closing.
Without limiting the foregoing, neither Sellers, nor anyone acting for, or on
behalf of Sellers, has made any representations, warranty, promise or statement,
express or implied, to Buyers, or to anyone acting for or on behalf of Buyers,
and Buyers shall be deemed to have agreed, and do hereby agree, that they are
closing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without having obtained
all necessary Consents.

          (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for the
Agreed Representations and Warranties, no representations or warranties have
been made or are made and no responsibility has been or is assumed by Sellers or
by any partner, officer, person, firm, agent or representative acting or
purporting to act on behalf of Sellers as to the condition or repair of the
Acquired Business or any Property or the value, expense of operation, or income
potential thereof or as to any other fact or condition which has or might affect
the Acquired Business or any Property or the condition, repair, value, expense
of operation or income potential of the Acquired Business or any Property or any
portion thereof. Except for the Agreed Representations and Warranties, Sellers
make no representations or warranties, express or implied, as to the suitability
or fitness of the Acquired Business or any Property for Buyer's intended use.

          (c) The parties agree that all understandings and agreements
heretofore made between them or their respective agents or representatives are
merged in this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto annexed, which alone fully and
completely express their agreement, and that this Agreement has been entered
into after full investigation, or with the parties satisfied with the
opportunity afforded for investigation, neither party relying upon any statement
or representation by the other unless such statement or representation is
specifically embodied in this Agreement, the Exhibits annexed hereto, or the
documents to be delivered at Closing. Except for the Agreed Representations and
Warranties, Sellers make no representations or warranties as to whether the
Properties contain asbestos or harmful or toxic substances or pertaining to the
extent, location or nature of same. Further, to the extent that Sellers have
provided to Buyers information from any inspection, engineering or environmental
reports concerning asbestos or harmful or toxic substances, Sellers make no
representations or warranties with respect to the accuracy or completeness,
methodology of preparation or otherwise concerning the contents of such reports.
Buyers acknowledge that Sellers have permitted Buyers to inspect fully the
Properties and investigate all matters relating to the physical condition and
operations of the Properties and Buyers will rely solely upon the results of
Buyers' own inspections or other information obtained or otherwise available to
Buyers, rather than any information that may have been provided by Sellers to
Buyers.

          (d) Except for the Agreed Representations and Warranties and the
indemnity provided by Sellers under the Indemnification Agreement, Buyers waive
and release Sellers from any present or future claims arising from or relating
to the presence or alleged presence of asbestos or other harmful or toxic
substances in, on, under or about the Properties including, without limitation,
any such claims under or on account of (i) the Comprehensive Environmental
Response,


                                       64
<PAGE>   73

Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as the same may have been or may be
amended from time to time, and similar state statutes, and any regulations
promulgated thereunder, (ii) any other federal, state or local law, ordinance,
rule or regulation, now or hereafter in effect, that deals with or otherwise in
any manner relates to, environmental matters of any kind, or (iii) this
Agreement or the common law.

     11.3. No Reliance. Notwithstanding any of the representations or warranties
made by Sellers in this Agreement, or the terms or provisions of any Related
Document, Buyers hereby acknowledge and agree that: (a) an Affiliate of AIMCO is
the property manager for the Properties, and (b) to the extent that AIMCO has or
should have knowledge (whether implied, imputed or constructive) with respect to
any of the matters covered by any of the representations or warranties of
Sellers contained in this Agreement, or the terms or provisions of any Related
Document, then each of such representations and warranties shall automatically
be deemed to be qualified and modified by such knowledge, and Buyers shall be
deemed to have waived their rights to rely upon the applicable representation
and warranty to the extent to which AIMCO had or is deemed to have had knowledge
of inaccuracies with respect to the Properties.

     11.4. Survival of Representations and Warranties; Reliance by Buyers.

          (a) Buyers and Sellers agree that all of the representations and
warranties of Buyers and Sellers as set forth in Articles V, VI and VII of this
Agreement and those set forth in any Related Document (other than the Tax
Matters Agreement) shall survive for a period of one (1) year following the
Closing, and that any claims, demands, actions or causes of action must be filed
in a court of competent jurisdiction and served on the Sellers or Buyers on or
prior to such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers' representations set
forth in Section 5.17 shall not survive the Closing. All material
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been relied upon subject to any investigation heretofore or prior to
Closing made on behalf of the party so relying. Each party shall promptly notify
the other of any facts or circumstances of which they obtain actual knowledge
prior to the Closing Date which render any of the representations and warranties
made by them inaccurate in any material respect. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in the event any party obtains actual knowledge prior
to Closing (from whatever source) that contradicts any of the foregoing
representations and warranties, or renders any of the foregoing representations
and warranties untrue or incorrect, and such party nevertheless proceeds to
Closing, such party shall be deemed to have waived its right to rely upon the
applicable representation and warranty to the extent to which it had actual
knowledge of inaccuracies prior to the Closing.

          (b) Each party shall have the right, prior to Closing, to give written
notice of any changed facts or circumstances occurring after the Effective Date
with respect to any of the representations and warranties made in this
Agreement, which changed facts or circumstances ("Changed Conditions") would
otherwise prevent them from remaking the representations and warranties as of
the Closing Date. If such Changed Conditions result from circumstances which are
beyond such party's control, then the failure to remake the applicable
representation(s) and


                                       65
<PAGE>   74

warranty(ies) shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement (although it could
nonetheless result in the failure of a condition).

     11.5. Attachments; Exhibits; Schedules. To the extent that any schedule,
attachment or exhibit contains information that pertains to a representation or
warranty not referenced in that schedule, attachment or exhibit, Buyers and
Sellers specifically acknowledge and agree that the information contained in
such schedule, attachment or exhibit shall qualify all representations and
warranties of Sellers and Buyers contained in this Agreement and not merely the
representation and warranty referenced therein.

                                  ARTICLE XII.
                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

     12.1. Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations among the
parties hereto shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to its principles of

of interests in any entity shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of
formation of the such entity.

     12.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the exhibits and
Disclosure Schedules attached hereto, and the Related Documents, constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, letters of intent, negotiations
and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties, and there are no
warranties, representations or other agreements, express or implied, made to
either party by the other party in connection with the subject matter hereof
except as specifically set forth herein or in the documents delivered pursuant
hereto or in connection herewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and any Related Documents shall not be deemed to
modify, amend or integrate the terms of any existing agreement between Buyers
and Sellers or any of their Affiliates, including without limitation the
shareholders' agreements of OHC and ORFG or any property management agreement to
which a Property-Owning Entity is a party.

     12.3. Modification; Waiver. No supplement, modification, waiver or
termination of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or
not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided.

     12.4. Notices. Unless otherwise provided for herein, all notices, claims,
certificates, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted

exercising governmental powers.

            (c) Should any controversy arise involving the parties hereto or any
of them or any other person, firm or entity with respect to this Agreement or
the Holdback Agreement or the Escrowed Funds, the Escrow Agent shall comply with
the terms of and act pursuant to Section 2.6 and the Holdback Agreement, as
applicable, above.

            (d) The Escrow Agent shall be compensated in accordance with the fee

preparation, operation, administration and enforcement of this Agreement and the
Holdback Agreement and its obligations hereunder. As between the Buyers and the
Sellers, the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be paid one-half by the
Buyers and one-half by the Sellers.

satisfactory to it concerning any question relating to its duties or
responsibilities hereunder or otherwise in connection herewith.

interpleader. The Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after the notice period
expires shall be to keep safely the Escrowed Funds and all accrued interest
thereon and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any,
or in accordance with the directions of a final order or judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction, at which time the Escrow Agent's obligations hereunder
