complied with this Article&nbsp;IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment

foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any Shares at such date as is immediately prior to the time at which such
