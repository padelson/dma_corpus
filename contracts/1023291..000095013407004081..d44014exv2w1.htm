RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent, the board of directors of Merger Sub, and the board of directors of the Company, following the unanimous recommendation of the Strategic Transactions Committee of the board of directors of the Company (the " _Transactions_ _Committee_ "), have unanimously (by all directors voting) approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and have authorized the execution hereof, and the board of directors of the Company has adopted a resolution unanimously (by all directors voting) recommending that this Agreement and the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement be approved by the shareholders of the Company. 

   

 WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, each of KKR 2006 Fund L.P., TPG Partners V, L.P., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley and Co.

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_  

   

 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 10 of the Texas Business Organizations Code (the " _TBOC_ "), and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the Company shall continue its corporate existence under the Laws of the State of Texas, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the effects provided by this Agreement and the TBOC and other applicable Law. Without

 1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Texas for filing as provided under Section 10.153 of the TBOC. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed by the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Texas and a written acknowledgement of filing has been delivered by the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Texas pursuant to Section 4.002 of the TBOC, or at such later date as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  _of the Surviving Corporation_

At the Effective Time, the certificate of formation of the Company shall be amended in its entirety to read in the form of the certificate of formation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "TXU Corp.", and, as amended, shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 2.2 _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended so as to read in their entirety in the form of the bylaws of Merger Sub, and, as so amended, shall be the

amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 3.2 _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and Bylaws. 

   

ARTICLE IV 

   

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_ 
  _Exchange of Certificates_  

   

 4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the holder of any capital stock of the Company or the sole shareholder of Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Common Stock, no par value, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties and (ii) Shares that are owned by shareholders who have not voted such Shares in favor of the Merger and who have otherwise taken all of the steps required by Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC to properly exercise and perfect such shareholders dissenters rights (" _Dissenting Shareholders_ ") (each Share referred to in clause (i) or clause (ii) being an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $69.25 per Share in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than Shares to remain outstanding pursuant to Section 4.1(b)) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, and each certificate formerly representing Shares owned by Dissenting Shareholders shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f). 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share referred to in Section 4.1(a)(i) or 4.1(a)(ii) (other than any Shares owned by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of 

    ##### 

  

 

the Company (including for these purposes TXU US Holdings Company), which
shall remain outstanding) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist, subject to the right of the holder of any Excluded Share referred to
in Section 4.1(a)(ii) to receive the payment to which reference is made
in Section 4.2(f). 

   

 (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to enter into a paying agent agreement with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), _provided_ that to the extent such deposits are being funded with the proceeds of the Debt Financing, Parent must deposit or cause to be deposited such funds by no later than immediately after the Effective Time. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section 4.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments under Section 4.1(a). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares evidenced by Certificates (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) 

    ##### 

  

 

to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied
by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of Shares
represented by book-entry on the records of the Company or the Companys
transfer agent, on behalf of the Company (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), other
than Excluded Shares, a check in the amount of the number of Shares held by
such holder as Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Per Share Merger
Consideration. 

   

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to and in accordance with this Article IV. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any Shares at such date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interests of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature. 

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person 

    ##### 

  

 

claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon
such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g))
equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, Shares that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a shareholder who has not voted such shares in favor of the Merger and who has otherwise taken all of the steps required by Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC to properly exercise and perfect such shareholders dissenters rights shall be deemed to have ceased to represent any interest in the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time and shall be entitled to those rights and remedies set forth in Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that a shareholder of the Company fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such right or remedy granted by the TBOC, the Shares held by such shareholder shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for payment for Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company with respect to shareholders rights to dissent and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle any such demands. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

   

 (h) _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. 

   

 4.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_. 

   

 (a) _Restricted Stock Awards_. Except to the extent otherwise agreed to by Parent and the holder thereof, immediately prior to the Effective Time, all restricted stock awards (" _Restricted Shares_ ") granted pursuant to the Stock Plans or otherwise that remain unvested shall automatically become fully vested and free of any forfeiture restrictions and each Restricted Share shall be considered an outstanding Share for all purposes of this Agreement, including the 

    ##### 

  

 

right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
4.1(a) and subject to the provisions of Section 4.2(g). To the extent that
the award agreement relating to any Restricted Shares provides that the
number of such shares that will vest will depend on the achievement of
targets measured by total shareholder return, the number of Restricted Shares
that will vest in accordance with the prior sentence shall be determined in

Prior to the date hereof, (i) none of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified, (ii) no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and (iii) the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the execution hereof. The Financing Commitments are in full force and effect as of the date hereof and are the legal, valid and binding obligations of Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, of the other parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, one or more Debt Financing Commitment may, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, be superseded at the option of Parent after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by instruments (the " _New Debt Financing Commitments_ ") replacing existing Debt Financing Commitment,  _provided_ that the terms of the New Debt Financing Commitments shall not (a) expand upon the conditions precedent to the 

   ##### 

  

   

Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment or (b) otherwise delay
the Closing. In such event, the term " _Financing Commitments_ " as used
herein shall be deemed to include the Financing Commitments that are not so
superseded at the time in question and the New Debt Financing Commitments to
the extent then in effect. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitments. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub under any of the Financing Commitments. As of the
date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied
or that the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing
Date. Assuming the Financing Commitments are funded, Parent and Merger Sub
will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Commitments) and any other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to pay all related fees and expenses.

Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing.

Neither Parent nor its "affiliates" (as defined in Section 11.003(2) of the Texas Utilities Code as in effect on the date hereof) have a present intention to acquire or construct any electric generation facilities offering, or capable of offering electricity for sale to, the ERCOT Region, except through the Company or its Subsidiaries.

As of the Closing, no foreign Person will control TXU Generation Company LP. 

  

 (i) _Brokers_. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for which the Company could have any liability prior to the Closing.

 (j) _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 5.1 hereof (for such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects without giving effect to any "knowledge", materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" qualification or exception) including, without limitation, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1(e)(iii), and (iii) estimates, projections or forecasts provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, and the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Commitments, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, means that, as of any date of determination (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of Parent and the Surviving Corporation on their existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which they intend to engage or propose to be engaged following the Closing Date, and (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay their liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. 

  

 (k) _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has caused the Guarantors to deliver to the Company the duly executed Guarantees.

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.2(b) but subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may (A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,  _provided_ that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person making such Acquisition Proposal that is given such access and that was not previously made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives; (B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) after having complied with Section 6.2(e), adopt, approve or recommend or propose to adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action could be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that, notwithstanding the commencement of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 6.2(a) with respect to any Excluded Parties, including with respect to any amended proposal submitted by such Excluded Parties following the No-Shop Period Start Date, and the restrictions in this Section 6.2(c) shall not apply with respect thereto, _provided_ that to the extent applicable to an Excluded Party, the provisions of Section 6.2(e) shall apply.

   ##### 

  

   

Agreement, _provided_ that an "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include a
recapitalization of the Company or its Subsidiaries or a split-off or spin-
off of one or more of the business units or Subsidiaries of the Company that
is not a component of and a material condition to a third party Acquisition

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal involving (A) assets that generate more than 50% of the consolidated total revenues, or (B) assets that constitute more than 50% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (C) more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board of directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment, would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (x) after taking into account the likelihood and timing of consummation (as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby) and (y) after taking into account all material legal, financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory or other aspects of such proposal. 

  

 " _Excluded Party Superior Proposal_ " means any Superior Proposal made by any Excluded Party on or prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and any subsequent Superior Proposal made prior to the tenth business day following the No-Shop Period Start Date by such Excluded Party.

 (ii) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a), cause or permit the Company to enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(c)) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

   ##### 

  

   

could be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law (any
of the foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), _provided_ that in the
case of any Change in Recommendation that is not the result of an Excluded
Party Superior Proposal: 

   

 (A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least five calendar days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation which notice shall specify the basis for such Change of Recommendation including, if in connection with a Superior Proposal, the identity of the party making the Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof; and 

   

 (B) prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company not to effect a Change of Recommendation. 

 

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal that is not an
Excluded Party Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent and Merger Sub and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.2(e) with respect to such new written notice,
except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three calendar days. None of
the board of directors of the Company, any committee thereof or the Company
itself, shall enter into any binding agreement with any Person to limit or
not to give prior notice to Parent and Merger Sub of its intention to effect
a Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in light of
a Superior Proposal, other than contemporaneously with the entering into of
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement or the termination of this Agreement,
in each case in compliance with Section 8.3(a). 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the board of directors of the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the board of directors of the Company expressly publicly reaffirms at least two business days prior to the Shareholders Meeting its recommendation in favor of the approval of this Agreement, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. 

  

 (g) From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such offer or proposal, the material terms and conditions of any proposals or 

   ##### 

  

   

offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any
such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the
Companys intentions as previously notified. 

  

 6.3 _Proxy Statement._  

  

 (a) The Company shall prepare promptly following the date hereof and file with the SEC as promptly as practicable (and in any event use reasonable best efforts to file within 20 business days after the date of this Agreement), a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that, at the date of mailing to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 (b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed promptly after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement, _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to mail the Proxy Statement prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date. To the extent required by applicable Laws, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare, file and distribute to the shareholders of the Company any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement if any event shall occur which requires such action at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting. 

  

 6.4 _Shareholders Meeting._ The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of formation and bylaws, call, give notice of and convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Shareholders Meeting_ ") and take all other reasonable action necessary to convene the Shareholder Meeting as promptly as practicable after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement to consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to hold the Shareholders Meeting at any time at which the Company reasonably believes holding the Shareholders Meeting could result in a violation of applicable Law. Subject to Section 6.2, the board of directors of the Company shall recommend such approval (and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement) and, unless there has been a Change of Recommendation, the Company shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such approval of 

   ##### 

  

   

this Agreement, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit the Companys
obligations set forth in Section 6.3 of this Agreement. Subject to the second
sentence of Section 6.4, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by a Change of Recommendation unless this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.3(a). 

  

 6.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. __ 

  

 (a) _Cooperation_. (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. The Company and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to file with the FERC an application for the FERC Approval within 20 business days after the date hereof. 

   

 (ii) The Company and Parent have cooperated in formulating the strategy and business plan set forth in Section 6.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter, which is consistent with Parents business plans. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in communicating such strategy and business plan to, and pursuing such strategy and business plan with, the appropriate Governmental Entities. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall be free to give notices to, make filings with, seek consents, waiver or approvals from or otherwise appear formally or informally before such Governmental Entities in support of the matters contemplated by the strategy and business plan, and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall provide support in connection therewith, including, to the extent requested by Parent, by making such filings, seeking such consents, waivers or approvals or otherwise appearing formally (including by providing testimony) or informally before such Governmental Entities in support of the agreed strategy and business plan. Parent agrees that it will consult with and consider in good faith the views of the Company with regard to any proposed modifications to the agreed strategy and business plan. Parent shall be free to modify the agreed strategy and business plan, but except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Business Plan or for modifications agreed by the Company, in connection therewith, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take or agree to take any action with respect to their respective businesses or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon Closing. Whether or not the Company agrees with any modified strategy of Parent, the Company shall take no action or make any statement intended or reasonably expected to frustrate, interfere with or delay any modification of the strategy and business plan the effectiveness of which is 

   ##### 

  

   

conditioned on the Closing, _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the
ability of the Company or any of its representatives to respond truthfully to
inquiries from any Governmental Entity. The Company shall not be required to
endorse as the Companys own strategy or take actions to support, or in
support of, any modification of the strategy and business plan that the
Company determines in good faith would not be in the best interests of the
Company to support if the Merger were not to be completed, _provided_ that
in any event the Company agrees, subject to the proviso in the immediately
preceding sentence, (x) to make such filings and seek such consents, waivers
or approvals as are requested by Parent or are requested or required by any
Governmental Entity and (y) to appear formally (including by providing
testimony) or informally before such Governmental Entity if requested by
Parent or required by such Governmental Entity, in each case in connection
with and to facilitate modifications to the strategy and business plan.
Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent
and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide
the other a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating
to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, or oral presentations made to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). In exercising
the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. The parties agree that to the extent practicable,
neither shall hold any meetings or substantive telephonic communications with
the PUCT or any Governmental Entity whose approval is required in connection
with the Merger without giving the other party or its representatives a
reasonable opportunity to participate, and in any event the parties shall
keep each other reasonably apprised of all substantive communications
with Governmental Entities regarding the Merger and the strategy and business
plan. 

   

 (iii) In connection with any notices, reports and other filings and all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations sought to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or in connection with any investigation, hearing, inquiry or other proceeding of any nature brought by any Governmental Entity with respect to or relating to this Agreement or the Merger, in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries consent to any action by any Governmental Entity or enter into or offer to enter into any material commitment, agreement or undertaking with any Governmental Entity or incur any material liability or obligation to any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed so long as such action is consistent with the strategy and business plan, including as modified by Parent. In the event that the Company and Parent agree upon the use of common counsel or consultants, they shall share equally the fees and expenses of such counsel and consultants. Notwithstanding anything in this Article VI to the contrary, actions taken by either party consistent with the Business Plan shall not be deemed to breach any provisions of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings with, investigation or other inquiry by such Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party (either directly or through one of its Representatives) the opportunity to attend and participate therein. 

  

 (d) _Regulatory Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.5, each of the Company (in the case of Subsections 6.5(d)(i) and (iii) set forth below) and Parent (in all cases set forth below) agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions: 

   

 (i) the prompt provision to each and every federal, state, local or foreign court or Governmental Entity (including FERC) with jurisdiction over any Company Approvals or Parent Approvals of non-privileged information and documents reasonably requested by any such Governmental Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

   

 (ii) with respect to the FERC Approval, the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act, and any other approval or consent of a Governmental Entity arising due to a change in Law after the date of this Agreement, the prompt use of its best efforts to obtain all such necessary approvals and avoid the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law that would restrain, prevent, enjoin, materially delay or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, disposal and holding separate of, such assets, categories of assets or businesses or other segments of the Company or Parent or eithers respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Entity giving effect thereto) if such action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid, 

   ##### 

  

   

prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x)
commencement of any proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance, enactment or
enforcement of any order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law
that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Merger by any Governmental Entity; and 

   

 (iii) best efforts to take, in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, prevent, enjoin, materially delay or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of this Section 6.5(d)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid, remove or comply with such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement; 

 

 _provided_ that nothing in Section 6.5(a) or this Section 6.5(d) shall
obligate Parent to proffer, agree or commit to (A) modify Parents and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) anticipated
capital structure (including levels of indebtedness) as set forth in the
Financing Commitments in effect on the date hereof (or in any Financing
Commitments thereafter having a capital structure reflecting at least as much
equity financing as is reflected in the Financing Commitments in effect on
the date hereof) in any material respect following the Closing, (B) subject
to Parents representations in Sections 5.2(g) and 5.2(h) being true and
correct in all material respects, any modification in the identity of the
equityholders of Parent and its Affiliates or the amounts of their equity
investment as set forth in the Equity Financing Commitments on the date
hereof, or (C) any Material Baseload Divestiture Requirement, except to
the extent that any such divestiture or submission set forth in this clause
(C) would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (e) _NRC Approval_. (i) The Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause TXU Generation Company LP to file as promptly following the date hereof as may be practicable (and in any event use reasonable best efforts to file within 25 business days after the date hereof) one or more applications (the " _NRC Application_ ") with the NRC for approval of the indirect transfer of the NRC license for Comanche Peak and, if and to the extent necessary, any conforming amendment of the NRC license to reflect such indirect transfer. Thereafter, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another to facilitate review of the NRC Application by the NRC staff, including but not limited to promptly providing the NRC staff with any and all documents or information that the NRC staff may reasonably request or require any of the parties to provide or generate. 

   

 (ii) The NRC Application shall identify TXU Generation Company LP, the Company and Parent as separate parties to the NRC Application, but the Company and Parent shall jointly direct and control the prosecution of the NRC 

   ##### 

  

   

Application. In the event the processing of the NRC Application by the NRC
becomes subject to a hearing or other extraordinary procedure by the NRC (a "
_Contested Proceeding_ "), until the earlier of the time such Contested
Proceeding becomes final and nonappealable and the Effective Time, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall separately
appear therein by their own counsel, and shall continue to cooperate with
each other to facilitate a favorable result. 

   

 (iii) The Company and Parent will bear their own costs of the preparation, submission and processing of the NRC Application, including any Contested Proceeding that may occur in respect thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall equally share the costs of all NRC staff fees payable in connection with the NRC Application and costs incurred by TXU Generation Company LP in filing and prosecuting the NRC Application. In the event that the Company and Parent agree upon the use of common counsel, they shall share equally the fees and expenses of such counsel. 

   

 (iv) Parent will conform to the restrictions on foreign ownership, control or domination contained in Sections 103d and 104d of the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2133(d) and 2134(d), as applicable, and the NRCs regulations in 10 C.F.R. § 50.38 and will, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, use best efforts to develop and implement in a manner satisfactory to the NRC a mitigation plan to address foreign ownership and control and any other concerns that may be raised by the NRC, including accepting any licensing conditions imposed by the NRC, _provided_ that nothing in this Section 6.5(e)(iv) shall obligate Parent to proffer, agree or commit to (A) modify Parents and its Subsidiaries (including the Company its Subsidiaries) anticipated capital structure (including levels of indebtedness) as set forth in the Financing Commitment in effect on the date hereof (or in any Financing Commitments thereafter having a capital structure reflecting at least as much equity financing as is reflected in the Financing Commitments in effect on the date hereof) in any material respect following the Closing; or (B) subject to Parents representations in Sections 5.2(g) and 5.2(h) being true and correct in all material respects, any modification in the identity of the equityholders of Parent and its Affiliates or the amounts of their equity investment, in each case as set forth in the Equity Financing Commitments in effect on the date hereof. 

  

 (f) If, after the date of this Agreement, the legislature of the State of Texas passes a statute which is enacted into Law or any binding regulatory or administrative action is taken pursuant to authority granted by such new statute which, in either case, imposes a requirement that the Company or its Subsidiaries divest or submit to capacity auctions for baseload solid fuel generation capacity (a " _Baseload Enactment_ "), then, unless within 30 days after the date either party notifies the other in writing of such Baseload Enactment (each such 30th day, a " _Baseload Waiver Date_ "), Parent and Merger Sub notify the Company in writing either (i) that such Baseload Enactment is not, and does not impose, a Material Baseload Divestiture Requirement or (ii) that no changes or effects to the extent resulting from such Baseload Enactment shall constitute or be taken into account in determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect (each written notice referred to in clause (ii) being an " _MAE Exclusion Agreement_ "), the Company shall have the right for 15 days after the Baseload Waiver Date to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(d). Each party agrees to notify 

   ##### 

  

   

the other promptly upon determining in good faith that a Baseload Enactment
has been enacted or taken. 

  

 6.6 _Access and Reports._ Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers and other Representatives and, subject to the prior written approval of the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), potential financing sources (that are not in competition in any material respect with the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than activities relating to financial transactions, including commodity hedging and trading activities), reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period from the date hereof and through the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its business, properties, facilities, operations and personnel as may reasonably be requested,  _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to furnish such information in a manner that does not result in any such disclosure, including obtaining the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to furnish such information in a manner that does not result in the loss of such privilege. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

   ##### 

  

   

interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may be
required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or
by the request of any Government Entity.

 (a) Parent agrees that the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be provided (i) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2008 with (A) base salary and bonus opportunities (including annual and quarterly bonus opportunities and long-term incentive opportunities) which are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary and bonus opportunities (but excluding equity or equity-based compensation) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) pension and welfare benefits and perquisites that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending 24 months thereafter, with severance benefits that are no less than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to retain the employment of any particular employee. 

  

 (b) Parent will cause any employee benefit plans which the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are entitled to participate in to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual thereunder, service prior to the Effective Time by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company (except to the extent it would result in (1) a duplication of benefits or (2) benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan (other than utilizing such years of service in order to satisfy any requirements for future benefit accrual only under any defined benefit pension plan)), and, with respect to welfare benefit plans of Parent in which employees of the Company are eligible to participate, Parent agrees to waive any preexisting conditions (to the extent waived under welfare benefit plans of the Company), waiting periods and actively at work requirements under such plans. 

  

 (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, fulfill and discharge its obligations to current and former employees under the Company Benefit Plans, _provided_  that this shall not prevent the amendment or termination of any such plans in accordance with their terms and the Surviving Corporation shall have any rights privileges or powers under the Company Benefit Plan which were previously held by the Company. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have the right to amend the TXU Thrift Plan to change the method of allocation of shares (or the proceeds from shares after payment of any applicable loan) held under the "suspense account" provided for in Section 6.5 thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have the right to create an irrevocable rabbi trust to hold the cash amount payable under Section 4.3(c) and the Company may fully fund such trust immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of control" within the meaning of each Benefit Plan listed in Section 5.1(h)(v) of the Company Disclosure Letter will occur upon the Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no employee or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan for any purpose. 

  

 6.10 _Expenses._ The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the transactions contemplated in Article IV. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense. 

  

 6.11 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance._ 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties service as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from 

   ##### 

  

   

and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
advantageous than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies
as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to
this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

  

 (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of formation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of formation or bylaws of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. 

  

 6.13 _Convertible Senior Notes._ The Company shall take all necessary action to enter into a supplemental indenture prior to the Effective Time with The Bank of New York, as Trustee under the Indenture for Unsecured Debt Securities Series N, dated as of July 1, 2003, under which the Convertible Senior Notes were issued (the " _Indenture_ ") pursuant to the Indenture and the Officers Certificate, dated July 15, 2003, establishing the Convertible Senior Notes, to provide, among other things, that on and after the Effective Time the Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible only into cash in an amount equal to the amount that the holders of Convertible Senior Notes would be entitled to receive in the Merger if they had validly converted their Convertible Senior Notes into Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 6.14 _Takeover Statutes._ The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any Takeover Statute is or may 

   ##### 

  

   

become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall promptly grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise promptly act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. 

  

 6.14 _Parent Vote._ Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any Shares and any shares of common stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide a consent), in favor of the approval of this Agreement at any meeting of shareholders of the Company or Merger Sub, respectively, at which this Agreement shall be submitted for approval and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of shareholders of either the Company or Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a meeting). 

  

 6.15 _Financing._ (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment ( _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, or otherwise so long as the terms would not adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitments or, to the extent the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments is not available to Parent, on other terms no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in such Debt Financing Commitment applicable to Parent and Merger Sub that are within their control. In the event that all conditions to the Financing Commitments (other than in connection with the Debt Financing, the availability or funding of any of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied in Parents good faith judgment, and subject in the case of bridge financing to the sixth sentence of this Section 6.15(a), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the Merger (including by taking enforcement action to cause such lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund such Financing). If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms no less favorable to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final day of the Marketing Period or, if earlier, the business day immediately prior to the Termination Date. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Financing Commitments, of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, or any termination of the Financing Commitments. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that (x) all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as high yield financing has not been consummated, (y) all closing 

   ##### 

  

   

conditions contained in Article VII (other than the delivery of the
officers certificates contemplated in Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b), 7.3(a) and
7.3(b)) shall have been satisfied or waived and (z) the bridge facilities
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (or alternative bridge
financing obtained in accordance with this Agreement) are available on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment (or
replacements thereof on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent and
Merger Sub), then Parent shall cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to
be used to replace such high yield financing no later than the final day of
the Marketing Period or, if earlier, the business day immediately prior to the
Termination Date. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ "
shall mean the first period of 20 consecutive days after the date hereof
throughout which (A) Parent shall have the Required Financial Information
that the Company is required to provide to Parent pursuant to Section
6.15(b) and (B) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 shall be satisfied
and nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied
assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such 20
day period, _provided_ that if the Marketing Period has not ended (i) on or
prior to August 16, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than
September 3, 2007 or (ii) on or prior to December 20, 2007, the Marketing
Period shall commence no earlier than January 2, 2008; and  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the "Marketing Period" shall not be deemed to have
commenced if, prior to the completion of the Marketing Period, Deloitte and
Touche LLP shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any
financial statements contained in the Company Reports. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the respective officers, employees and advisors, including legal and accounting, of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, including (i) participating in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing, _provided_ that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to high yield debt securities need not be issued by the Company or its Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _further_ , that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor, (iii) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company or any borrowing Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing) or otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral, _provided_ that such documents will not take effect until the Effective Time, (iv) furnishing Parent and its Financing sources as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than 30 days prior to the Termination Date) with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including all financial statements and financial data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of the type and form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act to consummate the offerings of debt securities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment at the time during the Companys fiscal year 

   ##### 

  

   

such offerings will be made (the information required to be
delivered pursuant to this clause (iv) being referred to as " _Required
Financial Information_ "), _provided_ that Parent will provide the Company
with a list of the form and types of financial and other information it will
request pursuant to this clause (iv) by no later than April 2, 2007 (subject
to any type or form of information subsequently identified by Parent that was
previously omitted in good faith or that has become customary, the failure of
which to include in the offering materials would cause such offering
materials to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact necessary to be stated in such offering material in order to
make the statements in such offering memorandum, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading), (v) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters,
consents, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested
by Parent, (vi) providing monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes)
to the extent, the Company customarily prepares such financial statements
within the time from such statements are prepared, (vii) taking all actions
reasonably necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the
Financing to evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries current assets, cash
management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto
for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements and (B) establish
bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the foregoing, _provided_ that such accounts,
agreements and arrangements should not become active or take effect until the
Effective Time, (viii) entering into one or more credit or other agreements
on terms satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent direct
borrowings or debt incurrences by the Company or its Subsidiaries are
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, and (ix) at the Companys
option taking or appointing a representative of Parent to take all corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by
Parent to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and the direct
borrowing or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Debt Financing,
including any high yield debt financing, by the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or require the Company to agree to pay any fees, reimburse
any expenses or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time for which it
is not reimbursed or indemnified under this Agreement. Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation at the request of Parent and indemnify the
Company for any loss incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
arising therefrom (other than arising from information provided by the
Company or its Subsidiaries). The Company hereby consents to the use of its
and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing, 
_provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not conditional upon the receipt by Parent of the proceeds of the Financing Commitments and that any failure by Parent to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date,  _provided_ that at such time the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) are satisfied, shall constitute a breach by Parent of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.16 _Treatment of Certain Notes._  

  

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to commence, promptly after the receipt of a written request from Parent to do so and the receipt of the Offer Documents from Parent, offers to purchase, and related consent solicitations with respect to, all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes identified on Section 6.16(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " _Notes_ ") on the terms and conditions specified by Parent (collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "), and Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of the Debt Offers shall be conditioned on the completion of the Merger and otherwise in compliance with applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations and the Company shall not be required to commence any Debt Offer until the No-Shop Period Start Date. The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Offers. With respect to any series of Notes, if requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Offer for such series (or in addition thereto), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the indenture and officers certificates or supplemental indenture governing such series of Notes (i) issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the outstanding principal amount of Notes of such series pursuant to the requisite provisions of the indenture and officers certificate governing such series of Notes or (ii) take actions reasonably requested by Parent that are reasonably necessary for the satisfaction and/or discharge and/or defeasance of such series pursuant to the applicable provisions of the indenture and officers certificate or supplemental indenture governing such series of Notes, and shall redeem or satisfy and/or discharge and/or defeasance, as applicable, such series in accordance with the terms of the indenture and officers certificate or supplemental indenture governing such series of Notes at the Effective Time,  _provided_ that to the extent that any action described in clause (i) or (ii) can be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time, it will be so conditioned, and  _provided_ , _further_ , that prior to the Company being required to take any of the actions described in clause (i) or (ii) above that cannot be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time, prior to the Closing, Parent shall irrevocably deposit, or shall cause to be irrevocably deposited with the trustee under the relevant indenture governing such series of Notes sufficient funds to effect such redemption or satisfaction or discharge. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offers (other than that the Merger shall have been consummated and that there shall be no Law prohibiting consummation of the Debt Offers) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offers or make any changes to the Debt Offers other than as agreed between Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, neither the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries need make any change to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers requested by Parent that decreases the price per Note payable in the Debt Offers or related consent solicitation as set forth in Section 6.16(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter or imposes conditions to the Debt Offers or related consent solicitation in addition to those set forth in Section 6.16(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter that are adverse to the holders of the Notes, unless such change is previously approved by the Company in writing. 

  

 (b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the consent solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and shall use their commercially reasonable 

   ##### 

  

   

efforts to cause the applicable trustee to) execute supplemental indentures to
the indentures governing each series of Notes for which the requisite consent
has been received, which supplemental indentures shall implement the
amendments described in the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal,
and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ")
and shall become operative only concurrently with the Effective Time, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to
the Debt Offers). Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay for
the Notes that have been properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Debt Offers and in accordance with the Debt Offers using funds
provided by or at the direction of Parent. 

  

 (c) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offers, including the Offer Documents. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents ( _provided_ that the Companys and its Subsidiaries cooperation shall be limited to matters that Parent cannot accomplish without additional cost or delay without the assistance of the Company or its Subsidiaries). The Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt Offers shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offers any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the holders of the applicable Notes (which supplement or amendment and dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of Parent, take the form of a filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.16(c), the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Offers and such compliance will not be deemed a breach hereof. 

  

 (d) In connection with the Debt Offers, Parent may select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected. Parent shall pay the fees and out-of pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and their Subsidiaries for all of their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the Debt Offers promptly following the incurrence thereof. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries, for and against any loss or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Offers (other than arising from 

   ##### 

  

   

information provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries that was materially
incomplete or inaccurate). 

  

 6.17 _Termination of Certain Other Indebtedness._  

  

 (a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent at least two business days prior to the Closing Date payoff letters from third-party lenders, trustees, or equity issuer (in connection with a lease transaction), as applicable, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, with respect to the indebtedness or rental obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries identified on Section 6.17(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter and any other indebtedness specified by Parent to the Company no later than 20 days prior to the Closing or entered into after the date hereof. 

  

 (b) On the Closing Date, subject to Parent making available necessary funds to do so, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to permanently (i) terminate the credit facilities requested by Parent to be so terminated, if and to the extent such facilities are either identified on Section 6.17(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter or specified by Parent to the Company no later than ten business days prior to Closing, and all related agreements, to which the Company and its Subsidiaries is a party and (ii) to the extent the related facility or lease is terminated pursuant to this Section 6.17(b), release any liens on its assets relating to those facilities or the lease transaction identified on Section 6.17(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter. 

  

 6.18 _Existing Hedging Arrangements._ Except to the extent that disclosure of a counterparty would violate any Existing Commodity Hedging Arrangements, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent from each counterparty who is a party to any commodity hedging and trading arrangements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing Commodity Hedging Arrangements_ ") to amend, change, novate or otherwise modify the collateral delivery requirements, liens and security interests granted or given to such counterparties in connection with such Existing Commodity Hedging Arrangements (including all liens granted on the Big Brown facilities) so that any such existing security interests, liens and other collateral delivery requirements are terminated, amended and/or otherwise released and replaced with liens on the Collateral (as defined in Exhibit B to the Debt Financing Commitment) that would be _pari passu_ with the liens granted to secure the Borrower Obligations, the Guarantees and other Hedging Arrangements as described and as defined in Exhibit B to the Debt Financing Commitment no later than the Effective Time (" _Hedging Arrangement Modifications_ "). With respect to those Existing Commodity Hedging Arrangements that would be violated by the disclosure of the counterparty, the Company shall, and cause its applicable Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the applicable counterparties to make the Hedging Arrangement Modifications to such exiting Commodity Hedging Arrangements. Parent shall provide all cooperation necessary in connection with the foregoing. 

  

 6.19 _Section 16(b)._ The Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions 

   ##### 

  

   

contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or
executive officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. 

  

 6.20 _Resignation of Directors._ The Company shall deliver to Parent at the Closing, except as otherwise may be agreed by Parent, the resignation of all directors of the Company, effective at the Effective Time, or, with respect to Subsidiaries of the Company, immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent necessary to effect any corporate action required by clause (ix) of Section 6.15(b). Upon the written request of Parent, as specified by Parent reasonably in advance of the Closing, the Company will seek to obtain the resignation of any or all directors of Subsidiaries of the Company, in each case, effective at the Effective Time. 

  

 6.21 _Notice of Current Events._ From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other orally and in writing of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (ii) the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.21 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to either party, the failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in Article VII.

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a); or

days after the date of such termination, pay as directed by Parent the
Termination Fee (as defined below) less the amount of any Parent
Expenses previously paid to Parent (if any), by wire transfer of same day
funds; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Termination Fee shall be payable as
directed by Parent pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph (b) unless and
until within 12 months of such termination the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternate Acquisition Agreement with
respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have approved or recommended
to the Companys shareholders, an Acquisition Proposal (substituting "50%"
for "15%" in the definition thereof). The Companys payment pursuant to
clauses (ii) or (iii) of this Section 8.5(b) shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their 

    ##### 

  

 

Affiliates for damages against the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and the
Companys and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives with respect to
any breach of any covenant or agreement giving rise to or associated with
such termination. " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean an amount equal to
$375 million if the Termination Fee becomes payable in connection with a
transaction or Alternate Acquisition Agreement with an Excluded Party and
shall mean an amount equal to $1,000,000,000 (one billion dollars) in all
other circumstances. 

   

 (c) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(b) (if at the time of such termination there is no state of facts or circumstances (other than a state of facts or circumstances caused by a breach of Parents or Merger Subs representations and warranties or covenants or other agreements hereunder) that would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) not to be satisfied on or prior to the Termination Date) or Section 8.3(c), Parent shall pay or cause to be paid, to the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within three business days following such termination) an amount equal to $1,000,000,000 (one billion dollars) (the " _Parent Fee_ "). 

   

 (d) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either party pursuant to Section 8.2(b) (or a termination by the Company pursuant to a different section of Section 8.2 at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 8.2(b)), the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than three business days after being notified of such by Parent, pay Parent all of the documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing) up to a maximum amount of $50 million (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), by wire transfer of same day funds. 

   

 (e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or 8.5(d) or Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.5(b) or 8.5(d) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.5(c) or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys right to receive payment of the Parent Fee from Parent pursuant to this Section 8.5 and the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under Sections 6.15(b) and 6.16(d) hereof or the guarantee thereof pursuant to the Guarantees shall, subject to Section 9.10, be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amounts, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, 

    ##### 

  

 

Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except that Parent shall also be obligated with respect to the
first sentence of this Section 8.5(e) and the indemnification and
reimbursement obligations of Parent contained in the penultimate sentence
of Section 6.15(b) and Section 6.16(d)).

 (c) Each party here has or may have set forth information in its respective Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates.
