Schedule 1.5(a) is a statement setting forth Seller's good faith estimate of
the Closing Date Working Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital"), which has
been prepared consistently with the calculations in Exhibit "E". If the
Closing Date Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital, then
the Purchase Price shall be an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price minus
the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Closing Date
Working Capital. If the Closing Date Working Capital exceeds the Estimated
Working Capital Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be an amount equal to
the Base Purchase Price plus the amount by which the Closing Date Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital. The determination of, and
payment for, the Closing Date Working Capital shall be made pursuant to the
principles set forth in subsections (b) through (f) of this Section 1.5 and
the relevant definitions appearing in ARTICLE VII and elsewhere in this
Agreement.



(b)As promptly as practicable, but no later than 75 days after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a statement setting forth its good
faith determination of the Closing Date Working Capital (the "Proposed Final
Working Capital Statement"), together with reasonable supporting
documentation. The Proposed Final Working Capital Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Exhibit "E". Purchaser shall
reasonably consult with Seller in the preparation of the Proposed Final
Working Capital Statement.



(c)If Seller has any questions about the Proposed Final Working Capital
Statement, Purchaser shall provide such work papers and similar materials used
or prepared in connection with the Proposed Final Working Capital Statement as
Seller may reasonably request. Seller shall have 30 days (the "Objection
Period") after the later of (i) receipt of the Proposed Final Working Capital
Statement or (ii) receipt of any requested materials to raise any objection
thereto. In order for an objection to be properly raised, Seller must provide
Purchaser with a written objection prior to the expiration of the Objection
Period specifying in reasonable detail the item or items in the Proposed Final
Working Capital Statement that the Seller disputes (the "Objection Notice").



(d)During the 30-day period immediately following the date the Seller delivers
an Objection Notice (the "Discussion Period"), Purchaser and Seller shall seek
in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to
any items specified in the Objection Notice. During the Discussion Period, Purchaser and
Seller shall each have access to the other party's work papers and similar
materials used or prepared in connection with the Proposed Final Working
Capital Statement or the Objection Notice, as the case may be. If the
Purchaser and Seller reach agreement on any or all of the disputed items, such
agreement shall be reduced to a written agreement executed by Purchaser and
Seller, and such written agreement shall be conclusive, final and binding on
the parties hereto as to such resolved items and shall not be subject to legal
challenge or judicial review for any reason (except for any claim by a party
based on fraud).



(e)If, by the end of the Discussion Period, Purchaser and Seller have not
resolved by written agreement all differences that they may have with respect
to items specified in the Objection Notice, either Purchaser or Seller may
submit any items remaining in dispute for arbitration to such independent
nationally recognized accounting or consulting firm with an office in Texas
mutually agreed upon by the parties (the "Accounting Firm"), provided that the
party giving notice to the Accounting Firm shall provide a copy of such notice
at the same time to the other party (the date such notice is provided to the
Accounting Firm being referred to herein as the "Arbitration Commencement
Date"). No later than 30 days after the engagement of such Accounting Firm,
each of Purchaser and Seller shall furnish the Accounting Firm with its
version of the working capital statement, together with reasonably detailed
supporting information and calculations. Each party shall be entitled to
submit to the Accounting Firm a brief in support of, or further explaining,
its position, with respect to the disputed items, which brief shall be
submitted to the Accounting Firm, and copied to the other party, not later
than 15 days following the Arbitration Commencement Date. Each party agrees to
cooperate with the Accounting Firm and provide such additional information
regarding the disputed items as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request.
The Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on
the standards set forth in this Agreement and on written presentations by
Purchaser and Seller, and not by independent review, only those amounts still
in dispute. With respect to each disputed item, the Accounting Firm's
determination, if not in accordance with the position of either the Purchaser
or Seller, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of
the amounts advocated by Purchaser or by Seller with respect to each such
disputed item. The Accounting Firm shall, within 60 days of the Arbitration
Commencement Date, complete its review of all information provided to it by
the parties and render a determination of the items set forth in the Objection
Notice. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive, final
and binding on the parties hereto and shall not be subject to legal challenge
or judicial review for any reason (except for any claims made by a party
grounded in fraud) if such determination is: (i) in writing and signed by the
Accounting Firm and (ii) timely furnished to Purchaser and Seller. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be shared between Purchaser and
Seller in inverse proportion to the Accounting Firm's determination of the
disputed items. (f)The Proposed Final Working Capital Statement shall become the "Final
Closing Statement" on the earliest to occur of (i) the expiration of the
Objection Period if an Objection Notice has not been delivered properly and
timely by Seller, (ii) the date the agreement contemplated by Section 1.5(d)
is executed, if such agreement resolves all disputed items (with such Proposed
Final Working Capital Statement to be adjusted to reflect items resolved
pursuant to such written agreement) or (iii) the date the Accounting Firm
delivers its written determination pursuant to Section 1 .5(e) (with such
Proposed Final Working Capital Statement to reflect: (A) if a partial
agreement was executed pursuant to Section 1.5(e) , the agreement of the
parties with regard to the items agreed and the Accounting Firm's
determination with respect to all other disputed items or (B) in the absence
of any agreement executed pursuant to Section 1 .5(d), the Accounting Firm's
resolutions of all disputed items) . The date on which the Proposed Final
Working Capital Statement becomes the Final Closing Statement pursuant to the
immediately foregoing sentence is referred to as the "Final Determination
Date." If the Closing Date Working Capital set forth on the Final Closing
Statement is greater than the Closing Date Estimated Working Capital,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of such excess. If the Closing Date
Working Capital set forth on the Final Closing Statement is less than the
Closing Date Estimated Working Capital, then Purchaser shall be entitled to
receive the amount of such difference from Seller. All payments required to be
made pursuant to this Section 1.5(f) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by the party entitled to
payment no later than the fifth day following the Final Determination Date; if
Seller fails to make any payment due under this Section 1 .5(f) within such
the aforementioned time period, Purchaser shall be entitled to receive such
funds from the Indemnity Escrow Funds.





ARTICLE II.

(a)Tax Periods Ending On or Before the Closing Date.



(i)Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed any Tax Return of a Controlled
Subsidiary for a Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date (a "Pre-
Closing Period") that is due after the Closing Date. Prior to filing any such
Pre- Closing Period Tax Return, the Purchaser shall provide a copy of such Tax
Return at least 15 days prior to its due date (taking into account extensions)
to the Seller for review. In the case of a sales or use Tax Return or
employment Tax Return, the preceding sentence shall not apply and the
Purchaser shall provide a copy of such sales or use Tax Return within 15 days
after filing such Tax Return.



(ii)Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for any Taxes of a Controlled
Subsidiary with respect to a Pre-Closing Period within 30 days after payment
of such Taxes by the Purchaser. Seller shall be obligated to reimburse the
Purchaser for Pre-Closing Period Taxes even if no Tax Return is required to be
filed with respect to such Taxes. The Purchaser shall pay the Seller the
amount of any refund of Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Period within 30
days of receipt thereof.



(b)Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending after the Closing Date.



(i)The Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of a
Controlled Subsidiary for Tax periods that begin before the Closing Date and
end after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period")



(ii)Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for any Taxes of a Controlled
Subsidiary that relate to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date within 30 days after payment of such Taxes by a Controlled
Subsidiary or the Purchaser. Seller shall be obligated to reimburse the
Purchaser for such Taxes even if no Tax Return is required to be filed with
respect to such Taxes. Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the amount of any
overpayment of Taxes of a Controlled Subsidiary that relates to the portion of
a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date within 30 days of the later of
(A) the date on which the Tax Return is filed with respect to such Taxes or (B) the end of the Straddle
Period (in cases where no Tax Return is required).



5.2Tax Allocation. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes
that are payable by Purchaser or a Controlled Subsidiary for any Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax payable by Seller which relates to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall:

(a)in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income
or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and



(b)in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be equal
to the amount which would be payable by Seller or a Controlled Subsidiary if
the Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date; provided, however, that any
franchise Tax shall be allocated to the taxable period (or portion thereof)
during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base on
which such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for
another taxable period (or portion thereof) is obtained by the payment of such
franchise Tax.

cost of all sales, use, transfer and similar taxes (if any) arising out of the
Transactions.



5.4[Reserved].

to reimburse the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. With respect to any
audit relating to income Taxes for any Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date, Seller will control and bear the cost of all Proceedings and may
make all decisions taken in connection with such audit (including selection of
counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its reasonable discretion
pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, Proceedings, hearings and
conferences with any Governmental Entity with respect thereto, and may, in its
reasonable discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where
applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax claim in any
permissible manner. The Purchaser shall have the right to participate at its
own expense. The Purchaser shall control any other audit or contest; provided
that Seller shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in any such
audit.

regarding the preparation of Tax Returns, audits, and other matters relating

extension thereof or the conclusion of all audits, appeals or litigation with
respect to such Taxes.

ARTICLE VI.

INDEMNIFICATION



6.1Indemnification.



(a)Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the Parties hereto contained in this Agreement shall not
terminate as of Closing but instead shall survive the Closing and continue in
effect for a period of 15 months after the Closing, except that the
representations and warranties in the following Sections of this Agreement
shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations: Sections 2.1, 2.2,
2.3, 2.9, 2.12(e), 2.17, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4. Upon expiration of the applicable
survival period, such representations and warranties shall thereupon expire
and no claim may thereafter be asserted in respect thereof; provided, that any
claim asserted by written notice delivered under Section 8.5 with reasonable
specificity by the Party seeking to be indemnified within the time periods set
forth in this Section 6.1(a) shall survive until such claim is finally and
fully resolved.



(b)Indemnification by the Seller. The Purchaser and its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each, a "Purchaser
Indemnified Party") shall be indemnified, defended, released and held harmless
by the Seller from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, costs
and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including reasonable
attorneys' and consultants' fees and expenses) actually suffered or incurred
by a Purchaser Indemnified Party (hereinafter, a "Loss" or, collectively,
"Losses"), arising out of or resulting from:(i) the breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller contained in this Agreement, (ii)
the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Seller contained in this
Agreement, and (iii) any Debts of a Controlled Subsidiary accruing on or
before the Closing that are not set forth on Schedule 1.2(c).

 (c)Indemnification by the Purchaser. Seller and its Affiliates, agents,
successors and assigns (each, a "Seller Indemnified Party") shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Purchaser from and against any and all
Losses, arising out of or resulting from: (i) the breach of any representation
or warranty made by the Purchaser contained in this Agreement, (ii) the breach
of any covenant or agreement by the Purchaser contained in this Agreement,
(iii) and (iv) any Debts of the Controlled Subsidiaries set forth on Schedule
1.2(c).



(d)Limits on Indemnification.



(i)No claim may be asserted nor may any Action be commenced against either
Party for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein, unless written notice of such claim or Action is received by
such Party describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim or Action on or prior to the date
on which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such
claim or Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 6.1(a) ,
irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or Action shall have
occurred before or after such date. For the sole purpose of determining Losses
(and not for determining whether or not any breaches of representations or
warranties have occurred), the representations and warranties of the Seller
shall not be deemed qualified by any references to materiality or to Material
Adverse Effect.



(ii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:(A)
an Indemnitor shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant
to Sections 6.1(b) or 6.1(c), unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses
which may be recovered from the Indemnitor equals or exceeds $575,000 after
which an Indemnitor shall be obligated only for Losses in excess of such
deductible amount; and (B) the maximum aggregate amount of all Losses which
may be recovered from an Indemnitor arising out of or resulting from the
causes set forth in Sections 6.1(b) or 6.1(c) shall be an amount equal to
Eleven Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($11,500,000). The foregoing
limitations do not apply to indemnities and reimbursements required under
Article V.



(iii)Net Insurance Proceeds and Tax Benefits. The amount of any Loss under
this Article VI shall be:



(A)reduced by the net amount of any insurance proceeds received by any Seller
Indemnified Party or the Purchaser Indemnified Party in connection with such
Loss. Each Indemnified Party agrees that it shall pursue in good faith claims
under any applicable insurance policies who may be responsible for such
Losses; and



(B)reduced by the net amount of any Tax benefits actually realized by an
Indemnified Party. 

(iv)NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE
FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT
DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR LOST BENEFITS, LOSS OF ENTERPRISE VALUE, DIMINUTION
IN VALUE OF ANY BUSINESS, DAMAGE TO REPUTATION OR LOSS TO GOODWILL, WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER
OR NOT ARISING FROM ANY OTHER PARTY'S SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT.



(e)Procedure for Asserted Claims. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified
Party of notice of any claim or the commencement of any Action, or upon
discovery of any facts which a Indemnified Party believes may give rise to a
claim (for avoidance of doubt, a claim shall include any third party claim
arising from notice or the commencement of any Action or upon discovery of
facts that may give rise to a claim, as determined by a Indemnified Party) for
indemnification from Indemnitor, the Indemnified Party shall, if a claim is to
be made against Indemnitor under this Article VI, notify Indemnitor in writing
of the claim, the commencement of the Action, or the facts discovered.
Indemnitor shall, for a period of 10 calendar days after delivery of 26 such
notice, be entitled to assume the defense of the claim or Action at its sole
cost and expense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnified Party,
and to settle or compromise the claim or Action with the consent of
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (unless
settlement involves only the payment of money by Indemnitor, in which case the
Indemnified Party's consent shall not be required). After notice of
Indemnitor's election to assume the defense of the claim or Action, Indemnitor
shall not be liable to the Indemnified Parties under this Article VI for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense of the claim or Action. However, the Indemnified
Parties shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the defense
of the Action with its separate counsel and at their own expense. If
Indemnitor does not elect to assume the defense of the claim or Action,
Indemnified Party shall act reasonably and in accordance with its good faith
business judgment with respect to the claim or Action, and shall not settle or
compromise any claim or Action without the consent of Indemnitor, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Parties agree to render to
each other reasonably requested assistance in order to insure the proper and
adequate defense of any claim or Proceeding. The failure to give notice under
this Article VI shall not relieve the indemnification obligations hereunder
unless, and then only to the extent, the failure results in prejudice to the
Party entitled to receive such notice.



(f)Mitigation. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will take
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss after becoming aware of any
event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith. In the event
that an indemnifying party makes any payment to any indemnified party for indemnification for which such
indemnified party could have collected on a claim against a third party
(including under any contract and any insurance claims), such indemnifying
party will be entitled to pursue claims and conduct litigation on behalf of
such indemnified party and any of its successors, to pursue and collect on any
indemnification or other remedy available to such indemnified party thereunder
with respect to such claim and generally to be subrogated to the rights of
such indemnified party. Except pursuant to a settlement agreed to by the
indemnifying party, the indemnified party will not waive or release any
contractual right to recover from a third party any loss subject to
indemnification hereby without the prior written consent of such indemnifying
party.



(g)No Double Recovery. For avoidance of doubt, no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to assert a claim for indemnification for any Loss for which it has
been reimbursed or indemnified pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
including any adjustment in the Base Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.5.



(h)Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification provisions in this Article VI shall
represent the exclusive remedy of the Parties under this Agreement and in
connection with the Transactions. Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its Affiliates, acknowledges, represents, warrants, and agrees that other
than the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article II (i)
Seller makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, in respect of
the transactions 27 contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) Purchaser has not
relied upon the accuracy or completeness of any express or implied
representation, warranty, statement, or information of any nature made or
provided by any Person on behalf of any Seller or any TAS Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Party shall have any
liability, and no Party shall make any claim, for any Losses or other matter
(and the Parties hereby waive any right of contribution against the other and
their respective Affiliates), under, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any other agreement contemplated herein, whether based on contract,
tort, strict liability, other applicable Laws or otherwise. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives any right or remedy
of rescission.



(i)Adjustment to Purchase Price. The Parties agree to treat any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this Article VI as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

This ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated effective as of August 5, 2015,
by and among Orion Concrete Construction, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("Purchaser"), T.A.S. Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" Seller") and IBEIRABANK Corporation, a Louisiana corporation, as
escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent").



BACKGROUND



A.Purchaser and Seller have entered into that certain Purchase Agreement,
dated as of August [5], 2015 pursuant to which Seller is selling its entire
equity and membership interests of its operating subsidiaries to Purchaser.



B.The Purchase Agreement provides that Seller shall deposit the Escrow Fund
(as defined herein) in an escrow account to be held by the Escrow Agent in
order to provide security for the payment to Purchaser of certain post closing
claims made by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement. Accordingly, the parties desire to establish an escrow account on
the terms and conditions set forth herein.



C.The parties hereto desire to appoint the Escrow Agent to receive, hold and
invest the Escrow Fund, and any interest or other income earned thereon (all
of which is referred to herein as the "Escrow Fund"), and the Escrow Agent has
agreed to act as such upon the terms, covenants and conditions hereinafter set
forth.



D.A material condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement is that the parties hereto enter into this Agreement.



AGREEMENT



In consideration of the mutual representations, warranties and covenants
contained herein, and upon and subject to the terms and the conditions
hereinafter set forth, the parties do hereby agree as follows:



1.Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement. As among Purchaser
and Seller, the provisions of the Purchase Agreement are hereby incorporated
herein by reference, but only as the context of this Agreement may require.
The Escrow Agent is not a party to the Purchase Agreement and shall,
therefore, act only in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in
this Agreement, and it shall not have any liability under, nor duty or
responsibility to inquire into, the terms and provisions of the Purchase
Agreement.



2.Escrow Fund. At the Closing, Seller shall deposit with the Escrow Agent an
amount in cash equal to Eleven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($11,500,000) ("Escrow Fund"). The Escrow Agent shall hold, administer and
dispose of the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of

this Agreement. Until such time as the Escrow Fund shall be distributed by the
Escrow Agent as provided herein, the Escrow Fund shall be invested and
reinvested by the Escrow Agent at the joint written direction of Purchaser and
the Seller, in the name of the Escrow Agent or its nominee, in Fidelity
Institutional Money Market Government Fund (FIGXX). The interest income for
this escrow shall be reported on Form 1099 as required by the Internal Revenue
Service to the Seller under tax identification number 26-2667357 and the
Seller shall provide a W-9 tax form to the Escrow Agent. The parties
acknowledge that the Escrow Agent may render administrative services and
receive additional fees from the administrator or distributor of said account.
The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to sell or redeem any such investment as
necessary to make any distributions required under this Agreement and shall
not be liable or responsible for any loss resulting from any such sale or
redemption.



The Escrow Agent shall send monthly reports to each of Purchaser and Seller
providing details of activity for the account and the Purchaser and Seller
hereby waive their right to receive trade confirmations as they occur.



3.Distributions of the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be distributed by
the Escrow Agent as follows:



(a)Working Capital Adjustment . Upon the Escrow Agent\'s receipt of a joint
written instruction signed by Purchaser and Seller stating that there has been
a final determination of the Closing Date Working Capital pursuant to Section
1.5 of the Purchase Agreement and specifying the amount, if any, to be paid by
Seller to Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.5(f) of the Purchase Agreement, the
Escrow Agent shall within five days of its receipt of that instruction,
release, by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by Purchaser,
an amount of Escrow Funds equal to the amount specified in such instruction.



(b)Indemnification Claim.



(i)If any Purchaser Indemnified Party makes a claim for indemnity pursuant to
Section 6.1(b) of the Purchase Agreement ("Indemnification Claim") prior to
November 5, 2016 ("Escrow Release Date"), Purchaser shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent and Seller a written notice (an "Indemnification Notice") setting
forth in reasonable detail the amount ("Indemnification Amount"), nature, and
basis of the claim. If the Seller does not deliver notice to Purchaser and the
Escrow Agent disputing such Indemnification Claim (a "Counter Indemnification
Notice") within thirty (30) days after Seller's receipt of the Indemnification
Notice, evidence of such receipt to be provided to Escrow Agent by Purchaser,
then the dollar amount of the Indemnification Claim set forth in the
Indemnification Notice shall be deemed conclusive for purposes of this
Agreement, and, at the end of such thirty (30)-day period, the Escrow Agent
shall pay to Purchaser the Indemnification Amount. The Escrow Agent shall not
be required to inquire into or consider whether an Indemnification Claim
complies with the requirements of the Purchase Agreement.



(ii)If a Counter Indemnification Notice is given with respect to a
Indemnification Claim, the Escrow Agent shall make payment with respect to an
Indemnification Notice only (1) in accordance with joint written instructions of Purchaser and
Seller or (2) after a decision has been rendered by a court or binding
arbitrator to enforce an award with respect to the amount of such
Indemnification Claim (resolved as between Purchaser and Seller in accordance
with the terms of the Purchase Agreement), and then in accordance with such
decision. Upon receipt of the joint written instructions or court order as
specified in the preceding sentence, the Escrow Agent shall pay Purchaser the
dollar amount specified in the joint written instruction or decision, as
applicable, from the Escrow Fund. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies
with any such order, judgment or decree of any court or binding resolution of
arbitration, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto
or to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such
order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set
aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.



(c) Release of Remaining Escrow Funds.



(i)Within five days of the Escrow Release Date (the "Distribution Date"), the
Escrow Agent shall release to Seller, by wire transfer to an account or
accounts designated by Seller, the remaining balance of the Escrow Funds in
the Escrow Account, less the amount of all Unresolved Claims. "Unresolved
Claims" means the aggregate amount of all Claims that are the subject of a
Counter Indemnification Notice that have not previously been resolved or
satisfied in accordance herewith, including any claims for which an
Indemnification Notice has been delivered but for which the period in which
Seller is entitled to give a Counter Indemnification Notice has not expired as
of the Escrow Release Date.



(ii)Unresolved Claims for which Seller has delivered a Counter Indemnification
Notice shall be administered in accordance with subclause (ii) of Section
3(b). Upon the expiration of the 30 day period in which Seller is entitled to
deliver a Counter Indemnification Notice for any Unresolved Claims, the Escrow
Agent shall release by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by
Buyer an amount of funds in the Escrow Account equal to the amount of such
Unresolved Claim. After the resolution of each Unresolved Claim, any remaining
portion of the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account not distributed to Buyer
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentences and not subject to other
Unresolved Claims shall be released by wire transfer promptly thereafter by
the Escrow Agent to an account or accounts designated by Seller.



4.Duties of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or
responsibilities other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement, and
no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to enforce any obligation of
any person, other than as provided herein. The Escrow Agent shall be under no
liability to anyone by reason of any failure on the part of any party hereto
or any maker, endorser or other signatory of any document or any other person
to perform such person's obligations under any such document. Except as set
forth in this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities under any provision of any other agreement, including without
limitation, the Purchase Agreement. 

5.Liability of the Escrow Agent; Withdrawal. This Escrow Agreement expressly
and exclusively sets forth the duties of Escrow Agent with respect to any and
all matters pertinent hereto, and no implied duties or obligations shall be
read into this Escrow Agreement against Escrow Agent. This Escrow Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement between the Escrow Agent and the other
parties hereto in connection with the subject matter of this escrow, and no
other agreement entered into between the parties, or any of them, shall be
considered as adopted or binding, in whole or in part, upon the Escrow Agent
notwithstanding that any such other agreement may be referred to herein or
deposited with Escrow Agent or the Escrow Agent may have knowledge thereof,
and Escrow Agent\'s rights and responsibilities shall be governed solely by
this Escrow Agreement.



Escrow Agent acts hereunder as a depository only, and is not responsible or
liable in any manner whatsoever for the sufficiency, correctness, genuineness
or validity of the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement or any part
thereof, or for the form of execution thereof, or for the identity or
authority of any person executing or depositing such subject matter. Escrow
Agent shall be under no duty to investigate or inquire as to the validity or
accuracy of any document, agreement, instruction or request furnished to it
hereunder believed by it to be genuine and Escrow Agent may rely and act upon,
and shall not be liable for acting or not acting upon, any such document,
agreement, instruction or request. Escrow Agent shall in no way be responsible
for notifying, nor shall it be its duty to notify, any party hereto or any
other party interested in this Escrow Agreement of any payment required or
maturity occurring under this Escrow Agreement or under the terms of any
instrument deposited herewith. The parties(except Escrow Agent) acknowledge
that the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to distribution plan payments,
shareholder service fees, administrative service fees or similar fees paid by
such money market mutual companies, distributors or agents. The parties hereby
consent to the Escrow Agent's receipt of such fees and that the interest paid
on the funds in the escrow shall be net of such fees.



Purchaser and the Seller, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify the Escrow
Agent for, and to hold it harmless from and against, any losses, liabilities,
claims, actions, damages or expenses (including reasonable expenses and
disbursements of its counsel) incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or
intentional misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent arising out of or in
connection with its entering into this Agreement and attempting to carry out
its duties hereunder, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending
itself against any such claim or liability. As between Purchaser and the
Seller, any such indemnification of the Escrow Agent shall be payable one-
half by Purchaser and one -half by the Seller. The foregoing indemnities in
this paragraph shall survive the resignation or substitution of the Escrow
Agent or the termination of this Agreement.



The Escrow Agent (and any successor Escrow Agent) may at any time resign as
such by giving thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Purchaser and the
Seller and delivering the Escrow Fund to any successor Escrow Agent jointly
designated by Purchaser and the Seller in writing, or by any court of
competent jurisdiction, whereupon the Escrow Agent shall be discharged of and
from any and all further obligations arising in connection with this
Agreement. Prior to the effectiveness of such resignation, Purchaser and the
Seller shall appoint a new Escrow Agent, which shall be a bank or national
banking association. The resignation of the Escrow Agent will take effect on the earlier of (a) the appointment of a successor (including a court of
competent jurisdiction) and (b) the day which is thirty (30) days after the
date of delivery of its written notice of resignation to the other parties
hereto. If at that time the Escrow Agent has not received a designation of a
successor Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after that time
shall be to retain and safeguard the Escrow Fund until receipt of a
designation of successor Escrow Agent or a joint written disposition
instruction by the other parties hereto or a final non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction. The Escrow Agent shall be paid any
outstanding fees and expenses prior to transferring the Escrow Fund to a
successor Escrow Agent.



6.Escrow Agent's Authority to Act. Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and
directed by the undersigned to deliver the subject matter of this Escrow
Agreement only in accordance with the provisions of this Escrow Agreement.



Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any written notice, request,
waiver, consent, certificate, receipt, authorization, power of attorney or
other paper or document which Escrow Agent in good faith believes to be
genuine and what it purports to be, including, but not limited to, items
directing investment or non-investment of funds, items requesting or
authorizing release, disbursement or retainage of the subject matter of this
Escrow Agreement and items amending the terms of this Escrow Agreement.



Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel at the joint and several cost and
expense of the undersigned (other than Escrow Agent) in the event of any
dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or
its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no liability and shall be fully
protected in acting in accordance with the advice of such counsel.



In the event of any disagreement between any of the parties to this Escrow
Agreement, or between any of them and any other person, resulting in adverse
claims or demands being made in connection with the matters covered by this
Escrow Agreement, or in the event that Escrow Agent, in good faith, is in
doubt as to any action it should take hereunder, Escrow Agent may, at its
option, refuse to comply with any claims or demands on it, or refuse to take
any other action hereunder, so long as such disagreement continues or such
doubt exists, and in any such event, Escrow Agent shall not be or become
liable in any way or to any person for its failure or refusal to act (baring
its fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct), and Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to continue to so refrain from acting until (i) the rights of all
interested parties shall have been fully and finally adjudicated by a court of
competent jurisdiction, or (ii) all differences shall have been adjudged and
all doubt resolved by agreement among all of the interested persons, and
Escrow Agent shall have been notified thereof in writing duly executed by all
such persons. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall become involved in any
arbitration or litigation relating to the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent is
authorized to comply with any decision reached through such arbitration or
litigation.



In the event that any controversy should arise among the parties with respect
to the Escrow Agreement, or should the Escrow Agent resign and the parties
fail to select another Escrow Agent to act in its stead, the Escrow Agent
shall have the right to institute a bill of interpleader in any court of
competent jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties.

 7.The Escrow Agent's Fees and Expenses. The Escrow Agent's fees shall be as set
forth on Exhibit A attached hereto and shall be payable equally by Purchaser
and Seller upon the execution of this agreement. The Escrow Agent is entitled
to its fees as well as reimbursement for its reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the performance by it of service under this Escrow
Agreement (including

reasonable fees and expenses of Escrow Agent\'s counsel). The Escrow Agent
shall be under no obligation to institute or defend any action, suit, or legal
proceeding in connection herewith, unless first indemnified and held harmless
to its satisfaction, except that the Escrow Agent shall not be indemnified
against any loss, liability or expense arising out of its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Such indemnity shall survive the termination or discharge
of this Agreement or resignation of the Escrow Agent and shall be subject to
the provisions of Section 5. To the extent any amount due to the Escrow Agent
pursuant to this Section 7 is not paid, the Escrow Agent shall notify all
parties and may debit such funds from the Escrow Fund if payment is not
received within 30 days of the due date.



8.Inspection. All funds or other property held as part of the Escrow shall at
all times be clearly identified as being held by the Escrow Agent hereunder.

at the end of such month or as of the date of such removal or resignation, as
the case may be.

to the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent shall, for each calendar year (or portion
thereof) that the Escrow is in existence, report the income of the Escrow on
