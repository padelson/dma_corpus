                                    CLOSING

         The Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Article 2 (the
"Closing") will take place at the offices of Andrews & Kurth L.L.P., Houston,
Texas and will be effective as of 12:01 a.m., Houston, Texas Time, on the date
that is three business days following the later of (a) the satisfaction of the
conditions to Closing in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 and (b) the determination of the
Average Price, or at such other time or place or on such other date as the
Parties agree in writing (the "Closing Date"). Except for purposes of Sections
2.1 and 2.2, all Closing transactions will be deemed to have occurred
simultaneously.

         2.1 ACTIONS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING.

         (a) Prior to or at the Closing, the LP agrees to effect the actions
required under the Formation Agreement so that the LP will be the sole owner of
the Contributed Interests.

         (b) Prior to the Closing, Heritage MLP will issue the Class C Units (as
defined in Section 2.1 of the Stock Purchase Agreement) to Heritage GP, which
will distribute the Class C Units to the stockholders of Heritage GP or, at
their direction, to FHS.

         2.2 CONTRIBUTION OF CONTRIBUTED INTERESTS. At the Closing, and on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the appropriate
Parties will effect the following actions to be taken by such Party:

         (a) Heritage OLP shall borrow not less than $171.395 million from
certain lenders and financial institutions (the "Debt Financing");

         (b) The LP shall contribute, assign, transfer, deliver and convey (for
purposes of this Section 2.2, "transfer") all the Contributed Interests to
Heritage OLP in exchange for (i) the payment by Heritage OLP to the LP of the
sum of $140.745 million in cash (the "Cash Purchase Price"), subject to
adjustment as specified in Section 2.6 (as so adjusted, the "Final Cash
Payment"), and (ii) the issuance by Heritage OLP to the LP of approximately
$10.0 million in limited partner interests in Heritage OLP ("Heritage OLP
Interests");

         (c) The Debt Financing shall be made recourse to the LP;

         (d) The LP shall redeem LP Interests with an aggregate redemption price
of $14.547 million and in payment therefor shall distribute $8.864 million of

or its designee, $0.660 million of cash to Peoples or its designee and $5.023
million of cash to Piedmont;

         (e) Using the remaining proceeds under the Debt Financing, Heritage OLP
shall contribute cash to repay debt of the Contributed Subs, such debt
consisting of total principal and interest of $30.650 million;

         (f) The LP shall transfer its Heritage OLP Interests (other than a
1.0101% interest in Heritage OLP) to Heritage MLP in exchange for common units
issued by Heritage MLP ("Common Units") determined in accordance with Section
2.3;

         (g) After the LP's purchase of the capital stock of Heritage GP, the LP
shall contribute an amount to Heritage GP as an additional capital contribution
to maintain Heritage GP's general partner interests; Heritage GP, in turn, shall
contribute a portion of this to Heritage OLP and a portion of this to Heritage
MLP to maintain its general partner interests in those limited partnerships;
Heritage MLP, in turn, shall contribute the same to Heritage OLP; and

         (h) The Transferred Assets shall be valued, in the aggregate, at
$181.395 million for all purposes, and such value shall be allocated among such
assets in accordance with the appraisal by Valuation Research Corporation. No
Party to this Agreement, nor any affiliate thereof, shall take any action, or
fail to take any action, inconsistent with such allocations of value.

Payments to be made under Section 2.2(d) are based on assumed transaction costs
of $5.0 million and will be adjusted pro rata to reflect the actual amount of
transaction costs determined as of the Closing. Other dollar amounts will be
adjusted, if necessary, in a manner consistent with the calculations in this
Section 2.2, to reflect the final determination of Average Price and any changes
(to the extent otherwise permitted under this Agreement) in the number of Common
Units outstanding.

         2.3 ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE FOR COMMON UNITS. In exchange for the
contribution of the Heritage OLP Interests by the LP pursuant to Section 2.2(f),
Heritage MLP shall issue to the LP a certificate representing Common Units, with
the number of Common Units to be equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest
whole number) of $10,000,000 divided by the Average Price.

         2.4 INSTRUMENTS OF CONVEYANCE. In order to effect the transfers of the
Contributed Interests contemplated by Section 2.2 at the Closing, the LP, or one
of the Affiliates of the LP, will execute and deliver to Heritage OLP one or
more instruments of conveyance, dated the Closing Date, substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.4 (the "Instruments of Conveyance"), that are
sufficient to vest good title to the respective Contributed Interests, free and
clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances.

         2.5 CLOSING PRICE. At the Closing, in exchange for the contribution of
the Contributed Interests, Heritage OLP will pay the Cash Purchase Price (the
"Closing Price") to the LP, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account furnished by the LP to Heritage OLP not later than three business
days before Closing.

         2.6 NET WORKING CAPITAL TRUE-UP.

         (a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Heritage MLP shall determine
the amount of the Net Working Capital included in the Contributed Subs and
contributed to Heritage OLP by the LP as of the Closing Date, such determination
to be made using the valuation methodology specified in Exhibit 2.6 ("Net
Working Capital").

         (b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Heritage MLP shall prepare
an unaudited statement (the "Final Statement") of the Net Working Capital
included with the Contributed Subs as of the close of business on the Closing
Date, such Final Statement to be prepared in the following manner:

                  (i) Heritage MLP shall deliver to the LP the Final Statement,
         fairly presenting the Net Working Capital of each Contributed Sub,
         individually, and of the Contributed Subs, in aggregate, as of the
         Closing Date. The Final Statement shall be accompanied by a report
         setting forth (A) the Net Working Capital, in reasonable detail, that
         was included with each Contributed Sub, as reflected in the Final
         Statement, and (B) the amount of any adjustment to the Closing Price to
         be paid and by whom pursuant to Section 2.6(c) and the basis therefor.
         The principles of presentation in the Final Statement shall be the same
         as those of the Financial Statements.

                  (ii) Following the Closing, Heritage MLP, on the one hand, and
         the LP, on the other hand, shall deliver to each other and each other's
         authorized representatives, if any, full access at all reasonable times
         to the properties, books, records and personnel of the Contributed Subs
         relating to periods prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
         preparing, reviewing and resolving any disputes concerning the Final
         Statement. The LP shall have 60 days following delivery of the Final
         Statement during which to notify Heritage MLP of any dispute of any
         item contained in the Final Statement, which notice shall set forth in
         reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. If the LP fails to notify
         Heritage MLP of any such dispute within such 60-day period, the Final
         Statement shall be deemed to be accepted. If the LP shall so notify
         Heritage GP of any dispute, the LP and Heritage MLP shall cooperate in
         good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as possible.

                  (iii) If Heritage MLP and the LP are unable to resolve any
         such dispute within 30 days of the LP's delivery of such notice (the
         "Resolution Period"), then all amounts remaining in dispute shall be
         submitted to such nationally recognized accounting firm as shall be
         reasonably acceptable to Heritage MLP and the LP (the "Independent
         Accounting Firm") within 10 days after the expiration of the

                                                          CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

         Resolution Period. Each party agrees to execute, if requested by the
         Independent Accounting Firm, a reasonable engagement letter. All fees
         and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
         Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Heritage MLP and
         the LP. The Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to
         determine, based solely on presentations by Heritage MLP and the LP,
         and not by independent review, only those issues still in dispute and
         shall be limited to those adjustments, if any, that need be made for
         the Final Statement to comply with the standards set forth in this
         Section 2.6(b). The Independent Accounting Firm's determination shall
         be requested to be made within 30 days of their selection, shall be set
         forth in a written statement delivered to Heritage MLP and the LP and
         shall be final, binding and conclusive. The Final Statement, as
         modified by resolution of any disputes by Heritage MLP and the LP or by
         the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be the "Final Statement."

         (c) To the extent that the value of the Net Working Capital shown on
the Final Statement contributed to Heritage OLP by the LP is not equal to zero,
the Closing Price shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be. Heritage
OLP shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the LP, the amount by which the amount of
Net Working Capital as set forth in the Final Statement exceeds zero, and the LP
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Heritage OLP the amount by which the Net
Working Capital as set forth in the Final Statement is less than zero.

         (d) The amounts, if any, referred to in Section 2.6(c), shall be paid
by the paying party under Section 2.6(c) by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account to be designated by the recipient.

         (e) The rights to indemnification pursuant to Article 9 (and any
limitations on such rights) shall not be deemed to limit, supersede or otherwise
affect the rights of the Parties to a full Cash Purchase Price adjustment
pursuant to this Section 2.6, provided that no claim for indemnification may be
made with respect to any matters or items to the extent reflected in the Final
Statement.

                                   ARTICLE 3

Parties or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives shall issue any
press release or otherwise make any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of each of the other Parties.

         6.5 ACCESS TO RECORDS AFTER CLOSING. For a period of six years from and
after the Closing Date, the LP and its Affiliates and representatives shall have
reasonable access to inspect and copy all books and records relating to the

after the Closing Date, whether accruing prior to or after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the LP shall pay to the Heritage Parties with respect to
the Transferred Assets, all such Taxes

Parties shall credit the LP for the amounts of such Taxes pursuant to the Net
Working Capital true-up mechanism set forth in Section 2.6, if any, paid by the
LP or its Affiliates and attributable to periods after the Closing Date. For the
taxable period within which the Closing Date occurs, the real and personal

period in which the Closing Date occurs, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the portion of such period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
period.

         (c) The Heritage Parties and the U.S. Propane Parties will provide each
other Party with such assistance as may reasonably be requested in connection

privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or

                  INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS

         9.1 INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE LP. From and after the Closing

as the case may be, and hold such Parties harmless against and in respect of any
and all Losses arising out of, based upon or resulting from:

any of the Heritage Parties or their Affiliates for Losses under Section 9.1(a)
unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses under Section 9.1(a)
exceeds $200,000 (regardless of whether, in the case of third party actions,
suits or proceedings with respect to any of the foregoing, the LP may have a
meritorious defense), at and after which time the LP shall be liable for all
Losses in excess of $200,000. The rights and remedies of the Heritage Parties
based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any clause of this Section
9.1 or any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement shall in no
way be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts upon which any such claim is based may also be the subject matter of any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement that would not give rise
to any rights or remedies of the Heritage Parties.

         9.2 INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE HERITAGE PARTIES. From and after
the Closing Date, the Heritage Parties, jointly and severally, shall indemnify
the LP, the LLC, their members and partners and their respective Affiliates and

be, and hold such Persons harmless against and in respect of any and all Losses
arising out of, based upon or resulting from:

         (a) the breach of any representation or warranty of the Heritage
Parties contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement; and

         (b) the breach by any of the Heritage Parties or failure of any of the
Heritage Parties or any of their Affiliates to observe or perform in any
material respect, any of their covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Heritage Parties will have any
obligation to indemnify the U.S. Propane Indemnified Parties for Losses under
Section 9.2(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses under
Section 9.2(a) exceeds $200,000 (regardless of whether, in the case of third
party actions, suits or proceedings with respect to any of the foregoing, any of
the Heritage Parties may have a meritorious defense), at and after which time
the Heritage Parties shall be liable, jointly and severally, for all Losses in
excess of $200,000. The rights and remedies of the U.S. Propane Indemnified
Parties based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any clause of this
Section 9.2 or any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement shall
in no way be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other
state of facts upon which any such claim is based may also be the subject matter
of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement that would not
give rise to any rights or remedies of the U.S. Propane Indemnified Parties.

commencement of any Proceeding by a Person not a Party to this Agreement in
respect of which the indemnified Party will seek indemnification hereunder (a
"Third Party Action"), the indemnified Party shall notify the Person that is
obligated to provide such indemnification (an "indemnifying Party") thereof in
writing, but any failure to so notify the indemnifying Party shall not relieve
it from any liability that it may have to the indemnified Party under Section
9.1 or Section 9.2, except to the extent that the indemnifying Party is actually
and materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. The indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Action
and to assume control of such defense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such indemnified Party; provided, however, that:

                  (i) the indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
         the defense of such Third Party Action and to employ counsel at its own
         expense to assist in the handling of such Third Party Action;

                  (ii) the indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written
         approval of the indemnified Party, which approval shall not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed, before entering into any settlement
         of such Third Party Action or ceasing to defend against such Third
         Party Action, if pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or
         cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed
         against the indemnified Party or the indemnified Party would be
         adversely affected thereby;

                  (iii) no indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of any
         judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an
         unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to
         each indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of
         such Third Party Action; and

                  (iv) the indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control
         the defense of any Third Party Action unless within 15 days after
         receipt of such written notice from the indemnified Party the
         indemnifying Party confirms in writing its responsibility to indemnify
         the indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Action and
         reasonably demonstrates that it will be able to pay the full amount of
         the reasonably expected Losses in connection with any such Third Party
         Action.

         Except as set forth in the following sentence, after written notice by
the indemnifying Party to the indemnified Party of its election to assume
control of the defense of any such Third Party Action in accordance with the
foregoing and compliance by the indemnifying Party with Section 9.3(a)(iv), (A)
the indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such indemnified Party hereunder
for any Legal Expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified Party
attributable to defending against such Third Party

Action, and (B) as long as the indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting such
Third Party Action in good faith, the indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge the claim
underlying, such Third Party Action without the indemnifying Party's prior
written consent. If the indemnifying Party does not assume control of the
defense of such Third Party Action in accordance with this Section 9.3, the
indemnified Party shall have the right to defend and/or settle such Third Party
Action in such manner as it may deem appropriate at the cost and expense of the
indemnifying Party, and the indemnifying Party will promptly reimburse the
indemnified Party therefor in accordance with this Article 9. The reimbursement
of fees, costs and expenses required by this Article 9 shall be made by periodic
payments during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills
are received or expenses incurred.

         (b) If the indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the
indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 9, the indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to all rights of the indemnified Party with respect to the claims to
which such indemnification relates. If an indemnified Party becomes entitled to
any indemnification from an indemnifying Party, such indemnification shall be
made in cash upon demand.

         (c) The right of indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of each of the Parties to this
Agreement, other than with respect to fraud or willful breach by a Party. So
long as a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 is being
contested in good faith by the indemnifying Party or such claim shall otherwise
remain unliquidated, such claim shall not affect any of the rights of the
indemnifying Party under the LP Agreement, including any right to current
distributions by the LP.

         9.4 SURVIVAL. All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement shall survive (and not be affected in any respect
by) the Closing, any investigation conducted by any Party and any information
which any Party may receive (other than information identified in the Disclosure
Letters).

         (a) The right to indemnification:

                  (i) with respect to any breach or violation of any of the
         representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than
         those in Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6(b), 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, 3.17, 3.20, 3.25,
         4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.7, 4.10, 4.19 and 4.28), shall survive for one
         year after the date of the audit of Heritage MLP for the first full
         fiscal year following the Closing;

                  (ii) with respect to any breach or violation of any of the
         representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.20 and 3.25,
         shall survive for three years from the Closing Date;

                  (iii) with respect to any breach or violation of any of the
         representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6(b),
         3.7, 3.9,

         3.10, 3.17, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.7, 4.10, 4.19 and 4.28, shall survive
         without any time limit; and

                  (iv) with respect to all covenants and agreements contained in
         this Agreement, shall survive for the applicable statute of
         limitations.

         (b) The expiration of any survival period under this Agreement will not
affect the liability of any Party under this Article 9 for any Loss as to which
a bona fide claim has been asserted prior to the termination of such survival
period.

         9.5 NO SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. No Party shall be entitled to
recover special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages from the other
Parties, and each Party hereby waives any claim or right to special,
consequential, exemplary or punitive damages hereunder, even if caused by the
active, passive, sole, joint, concurrent or comparative negligence, strict
liability, or other fault of any Party, other than fraud or intentional
misconduct.

         10.2 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, together with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto (where applicable, as
executed and delivered), constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

         10.3 BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFIT. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) by any Party without the prior written consent of
each of the Parties, and any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void. Except as provided in Article 9, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties,
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

         10.4 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered divisible and such provision
shall be deemed inoperative to the extent it is deemed unenforceable, and in all
other respects this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; provided,
however, that if any such provision may be made enforceable by limitation
thereof, then such provision shall be deemed to be so limited and shall be
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

         10.5 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

         10.6 JURISDICTION. Subject to Section 10.10, any legal action, suit or
proceeding in law or equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may only be instituted in any state
or federal court located in the State of Texas, and each Party agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, suit or
proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of
such court, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that
the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court.
Each Party further irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in
any such action, suit or proceeding. Any and all service of process and any
other notice in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be effective against
any Party if given by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) or
by any other means which requires a signed receipt in accordance with, and at
the address listed in, Section 10.1. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any manner permitted by law.

         10.7 FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time following the Closing, at
the request of any Party and without further consideration, the other Parties
shall execute and deliver to such requesting Party such instruments and
documents and take such other action as such requesting Party may reasonably
request or as may be otherwise necessary to (a) more fully and effectively
transfer to, and vest in, Heritage OLP or Heritage Service Sub the Transferred
Assets or the Contributed Interests, (b) enable Heritage OLP or Heritage Service
Sub to assume and fully and timely perform in accordance with their terms any or
all of the Transferred Contracts, (c) enable Heritage OLP or Heritage Service
Sub to continue the Business, and (d) otherwise consummate more fully and
effectively the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements.

         10.8 DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive headings herein are inserted
for convenience of reference only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement
and shall not affect in any manner the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

         10.9 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         10.10 DISPUTE RESOLUTION. From and after the Closing, the Parties shall
use the Dispute Resolution Procedures, attached as Exhibit 10.10, to resolve in
good faith any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, including any dispute involving the payment of
indemnification pursuant to Article 9, except to the extent otherwise set forth
herein. Nothing herein is intended to limit the Parties from resolving
informally between them any dispute, controversy or claim that may arise, thus
avoiding the necessity of using the Dispute Resolution Procedures.

                  been purchased for future delivery or placed into storage for

                  that have been pre-sold or bought to protect against

         2.1 NONCOMPETITION COVENANT.

         (a) Except for Permitted Activities and except as provided in Sections
2.2 and 2.3, each Restricted Party hereby agrees not to engage, invest or
participate, directly or indirectly, in any Competitive Business during the
Term, including the ownership, management, operation or control of (or

         2.2 PARTNERSHIP'S PURCHASE RIGHT.

         (a) Majority Competitive Business Acquisitions. No Restricted Party may
acquire an interest in, directly or indirectly, a Majority Competitive Business.

         (b) Minority Competitive Business Acquisitions. If an Acquiring Party
has acquired an interest in, directly or indirectly, a Minority Competitive
Business, the Acquiring Party must give written notice of such acquisition to
the other parties and the Partnership (the "Acquisition Notice"). The Acquiring
Party shall give the Acquisition Notice no later than five Business Days after

Business. The Acquisition Notice shall include all details of the Competitive
Business and copies of all instruments, proposals, drawings, agreements,
summaries, evaluations, and other information in the Acquiring Party's
possession related to such Competitive Business. The Acquisition Notice also
shall include an itemized statement detailing a reasonable good faith estimate

Acquisition Notice, the Partnership and the Other Venturers will execute a
confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Acquiring
Party.

         (c) For 20 Business Days (the "Notice Period") after receipt of the
Acquisition Notice, the Partnership may elect by notice to the Acquiring Party
(the "Negotiation Notice") to negotiate to purchase all, but not less than all,
of such Acquiring Party's interest in such Competitive Business at the
Enterprise Value thereof. Immediately following the receipt of the Negotiation
Notice, the Partnership and the Acquiring Party shall initiate negotiations to
determine Enterprise Value.

         (d) If the Partnership does not give Negotiation Notice to the
Acquiring Party within the Notice Period or if during the Notice Period the
Partnership furnishes written notice to the Acquiring Party of its election not
to acquire an interest in the Competitive Business (which notice shall be deemed
to be irrevocable), then the Partnership will have no further rights to acquire
any interest in the Competitive Business, and operating such Competitive
Business will be a Permitted Activity under this Agreement.

         (e) Within ten Business Days after the final determination of the
Enterprise Value, the Partnership must provide notice (the "Purchase Notice") to
the Acquiring Party if the Partnership elects to purchase all, but not less than
all, of the Acquiring Party's interest in the Competitive Business. Within 40
Business Days of its receipt of such Purchase Notice, the Partnership shall pay
the Acquiring Party the Enterprise Value of such Competitive Business and the
Acquiring Party shall assign to the Partnership all of its interest in such
Competitive Business.

         (f) If the Partnership does not provide a Purchase Notice within ten
Business Days after the final determination of the Enterprise Value or if the
Partnership elects in the Purchase Notice not to purchase such interest, then
(i) the Partnership will have no further rights to acquire an interest in the
Competitive Business, (ii) the Partnership will pay all appraisal costs related
to the determination of the Enterprise Value of such interest and (iii)
operating such Competitive Business will be a Permitted Activity under this
Agreement.

         (g) The Acquiring Party shall not negotiate or enter into any
agreements or contracts related to the acquisition of an interest in the
Competitive Business that would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise limit the
rights of the Partnership freely to acquire an interest in the Competitive
Business or otherwise to exercise its rights hereunder.

         2.3 CHANGE OF CONTROL OF VENTURER. If (a) a Change of Control of any
Venturer (the "Acquired Venturer") occurs, (b) the Acquired Venturer's Class A
Units and Limited Partner Interests are not purchased by any Other Venturer or
Venturers pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Transfer Restriction Agreement and (c)
the Acquired Venturer's Class A Units are not converted to Class B Units, then
the Person acquiring the Acquired Venturer (the "Acquiror") must execute and
will be bound by all provisions of this Agreement as provided in Section 3.1(f)
of the LLC Agreement; provided, however, that if the Acquiror owns or has an
interest in a Competitive Business (the

"Acquiror Competitive Business"), operating such Acquiror Competitive Business
will be a Permitted Activity under this Agreement.

         2.4 PERMITTED ACTIVITIES. The provisions of Section 2.1 shall not be
construed to prohibit or restrict any Restricted Party from engaging in the
following activities (the "Permitted Activities"):

         (a) owning, individually or in the aggregate, less than ten percent of
any class of securities listed for or admitted to trading on a national or
foreign securities exchange or on The Nasdaq Stock Market;

materials to the Partnership or the General Partner;

         (c) providing engineering services to unrelated third parties with
respect to Restricted Activities to be conducted by such third parties;

         (d) owning and operating such Venturer's Excluded Assets;

         (e) administering any contracts that are to be transferred to the
Partnership, which transfer requires the consent of a third party or the
approval of a Governmental Authority that has not yet been obtained;

         (f) the purchase, sale, exchange, marketing, trading, storage or
transportation of propane solely for the purposes of using such propane for peak
shaving in connection with such Restricted Party's natural gas business or its
electrical power generation facilities;

         (g) engaging in an Acquiror Competitive Business under Section 2.3;

         (h) engaging in a Competitive Business as an Acquiring Party, if

and industrial customers primarily for use as interruptible fuel through AGL
Parent's and Piedmont's ownership and operation of Southstar Energy Services,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or any successor entity, and all
matters which are reasonably attendant thereto.

         2.5 DURATION AND SCOPE. The Parties acknowledge their belief and
agreement that the duration and scope of the noncompetition covenants set forth
in this Article 2 and in Article 4 are fair and reasonable. If any of the
restrictions contained in this Article 2 or in Article 4 is determined by any
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, or to be
enforceable only if modified in duration or scope, each Party agrees that:


                               Exhibit 7.2(m) - 5

<PAGE>   104

         (a) this Agreement shall be automatically amended in duration and scope
for application in the jurisdictional area of such court, without any further
action by any of the Parties, so as to provide the maximum duration and scope
enforceable in accordance with Applicable Law;

         (b) the reviewing court or arbitration panel is authorized and
empowered to rewrite any such unenforceable provision in a manner that will
result in such restriction being enforceable in such court or arbitration
panel's jurisdictional area, provided, that if the reviewing court or
arbitration panel will not exercise its power to rewrite any such unenforceable
provision, the Parties will amend this Agreement to rewrite any such
unenforceable provision in a manner that will result in such restriction being
enforceable in such court or arbitration panel's jurisdictional area; and

         (c) the terms and provisions of this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect, as originally written, in all areas outside the jurisdictional
area of such court.

                                    ARTICLE 3
                                    REMEDIES

         3.1 REMEDIES. The covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement
relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters. Each of the conditions and
restraints contained herein is necessary for the reasonable and proper
protection of each of the Parties and is reasonable with respect to subject
matter, length of time and geographic area. Each of the Parties further agrees
that a violation of any of the terms hereof would cause irreparable injury in an
amount that would be impossible to estimate or determine and for which any
remedy at law would be inadequate. Consequently, each Party agrees that upon any
breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by such Party, any Other Party
affected by such breach shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief against such breach or threatened breach, without having to
post bond or provide any other form of security, and that each Party shall have
the remedy of specific performance, which rights and remedies shall be
cumulative and nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any other rights and
remedies otherwise available under any other contract or agreement or at law or
in equity and to which such Party might be entitled.

                                    ARTICLE 4
                                      TERM

         4.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement (the "Term") shall commence on the
Closing Date and continue until the earlier of the second anniversary of the
date of an IPO or the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however,
that this Agreement will terminate with respect to a Venturer on any earlier
date that is the second anniversary of the first day that such Venturer and its
Affiliates, collectively, hold no Class A Units.

                               Exhibit 7.2(m) - 7

                                                                       EXHIBIT A

                              VALUATION PROCEDURE

         The Enterprise Value of any interest in a Competitive Business (the
"Valued Interest") will equal the fair market value of such interest (as of the
date the Acquiring Party first acquired an interest in such Competitive
Business, without giving effect to such acquisition) determined using the
following appraisal procedure:

         1. SELECTION OF APPRAISERS. The Partnership will select an appraisal
firm of national reputation by mutual written agreement (the "Purchaser
Appraiser"). The Acquiring Party will select an appraisal firm of national
reputation (the "Other Appraiser"). The Purchaser Appraiser and the Other
Appraiser will select a third appraisal firm of national reputation by mutual
written agreement (the "Third Appraiser" and, collectively with the Purchaser
Appraiser and the Other Appraiser, the "Appraisers"). Each Appraiser will
execute a confidentiality agreement in favor of the Partnership and the
Acquiring Party in connection with such Appraiser's appraisal.

         2. APPRAISAL PROCEDURE.

         (a) Within 15 days after the selection of the Third Appraiser, each
Appraiser will determine the fair market value of the Valued Interest (the
"Value") as of the date the Acquiring Party first acquired an interest in such
Competitive Business.

         (b) The Values determined by each of the Appraisers will be averaged to
determine the "Average Value." The two Values numerically closest to the Average
Value will be averaged, and the average of such two Values will be the
"Enterprise Value" of the Valued Interest for purposes of this Agreement;
provided, however, that if the two Values numerically farthest from the Average
Value are equally far from the Average Value, the "Enterprise Value" of the
Valued Interest for purposes of this Agreement will be the Average Value.

         (c) The determination of Enterprise Value set forth in this Exhibit A
will be final and conclusive on the Parties.

         3. COSTS. The Partnership will pay all costs of the Purchaser
Appraiser, the Acquiring Party will pay all costs of the Other Appraiser (unless
otherwise provided in Section 2.2(f) of the Agreement) and the Partnership will
pay all other costs of appraisal under this Exhibit A, including all costs of
the Third Appraiser.

         4. EXTENSION OF TIME. The time periods provided in this Exhibit A will
be automatically extended at the request of an Appraiser if necessary in order
to obtain additional information or to provide a reasonable period of time to
properly analyze information delivered to such Appraiser, but not more than 30
days.

         5. CERTAIN INFORMATION. The Acquiring Party will provide the Appraisers
access to all information, books and records and other data and documentation
(including


                               Exhibit 7.2(m) - 12

matters that may be deemed trade secrets or otherwise confidential, provided an
appropriate confidentiality agreement is executed) to the extent reasonably
required by the Appraisers for purposes of determining the Enterprise Value of a
Valued Interest and will fully and promptly cooperate with reasonable requests
by the Appraisers for information regarding the Valued Interest or the
Competitive Business. If financial information is provided to the Appraisers,
the financial information will be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
consistent with prior periods, or otherwise as agreed by the Parties.

         6. FAIR MARKET VALUE. As used in this Exhibit A, "fair market value"
means, when used with respect to any interest in a Competitive Business, the
most probable cash price that such interest would bring at a fair sale thereof
(taking into account, as appropriate, all liabilities relating to such interest,
but excluding any tax or other benefit or liability realized or incurred by the
Acquiring Party in connection with such sale), determined in a commercially
reasonable manner, assuming that (i) each of the buyer and the seller acts
prudently and knowledgeably, (ii) neither the buyer nor the seller is under
compulsion to sell, buy or act under other undue stimulus, (iii) each of the
buyer and the seller is typically motivated, well informed and advised and
acting in what it considers to be its best interests and (iv) the payment of the
purchase price is made in cash.

                          DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES

         1. GENERAL PROCEDURE. The Parties shall use the procedures set forth in
this Exhibit 10.10 to resolve in good faith any dispute, controversy or claim
(i) arising between the LP, on the one hand, and one or both of Heritage MLP and
Heritage OLP, on the other hand (together the "Disputing Heritage Parties"), and
(ii) related to this Agreement, including any dispute over the performance,
breach, termination or interpretation of this Agreement; provided, however, that
a Party may seek equitable relief prior to using the procedures set forth in
this Exhibit 10.10 if, in the reasonable judgment of such Party, such Party will
suffer irreparable harm if such equitable relief is not granted. Nothing herein
is intended (i) to address disputes, controversies or claims arising between
Heritage MLP and Heritage OLP that do not involve the LP or (ii) to limit the
Parties from resolving informally among them any dispute, controversy or claim
that may arise.

         2. MEDIATION. If any dispute, controversy or claim arises between the
LP and the Disputing Heritage Parties after the Closing Date and the LP and the
Disputing Heritage Parties cannot resolve such dispute, controversy or claim
informally, then the LP and the Disputing Heritage Parties shall attempt in good
faith to settle the matter by submitting the dispute, controversy or claim to
mediation within 30 days after the date that the dispute, controversy or claim
arises, using any mediator upon which they mutually agree. If the LP and the
Disputing Heritage Parties are unable to agree mutually upon a mediator within
15 days after submitting to mediation, the case shall be referred to the
__________________________ office of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA") for mediation. The cost of the mediator will be paid by the LP, on the
one hand, and the Disputing Heritage Parties, on the other hand, equally.

         3. ARBITRATION.

         3.1 ALL DISPUTES ARBITRATION. All disputes between the LP and the
Disputing Heritage Parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved through
negotiation or mediation shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with
this Section 3.1 or, if one exists, the similar arbitration provision of the
Stock Purchase Agreement or the Subscription Agreement, and the Parties hereby
expressly waive all rights to have any such disputes heard before a court of
law, except the right to enforce an arbitration award as described in Section
3.5 below. Arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. Section 1, et seq., and not by the arbitration acts, statutes or rules of
any other jurisdiction. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this
Section 3.1 and the terms of an express arbitration provision in the Stock
Purchase Agreement or the Subscription Agreement, the arbitration provision in
such other agreement shall control as to any disputes arising under that
agreement.

         3.2 PROCEDURE. In the event the LP and the Disputing Heritage Parties
are unable to resolve a dispute arising under this Agreement or the Stock
Purchase


                               Exhibit 10.10 - 1

Agreement or the Subscription Agreement after exercising good faith efforts to
do so pursuant to the procedures of Section 2 hereof, the LP or the Disputing
Heritage Parties, as the case may be, may require that the matter be resolved
through binding arbitration by submitting a written notice to the other Parties
(including notice to any Heritage Party that is not a Disputing Heritage Party).
The Party giving notice shall select one of three arbitrators and shall prepare
a written notice containing the name of such Party's arbitrator and a statement
of the issue(s) presented for arbitration. Within 15 days after receipt of a
notice of arbitration, the LP (if the Party giving notice is a Disputing
Heritage Party) or the Disputing Heritage Parties (if the Party giving notice
was the LP) shall select the second of three arbitrators by written notice and
may designate any additional issue(s) for arbitration. The two named arbitrators
shall select the third arbitrator within 15 days after the date on which the
second arbitrator was named. Should the two arbitrators fail to agree on the
selection of the third arbitrator, any Party shall be entitled to request the
Senior Judge of the United States District Court of the ______ District of
_________ to select the third arbitrator. If the Senior Judge refuses or is
unable to select the third arbitrator, the Parties shall ask the AAA to appoint
the third arbitrator, it being understood, however, that the AAA shall not act
as administrator of the arbitration. All arbitrators shall be qualified by
education or experience within the propane or energy industry (to the extent
relevant) to decide the issues presented for arbitration. No arbitrator shall be
a current or former director, officer or employee of any Party, or any of its
Affiliates; an attorney (or member of a law firm) who has rendered legal
services to any Party, or its Affiliates, within the preceding three years; or
an accountant (or member of an accounting firm) who has rendered accounting or
consulting services to any Party or its Affiliates, within the preceding three
years; or an owner of any debt or equity securities (including but not limited
to common or preferred stock or any derivatives thereof) of any Party or its
Affiliates.

         3.3 ARBITRATION HEARINGS. The three arbitrators shall commence the
arbitration hearing within 25 days following the appointment of the third
arbitrator, or at such later date as the LP and the Disputing Heritage Parties
may agree. The proceeding shall be held at a mutually acceptable site in
____________________. If the LP and the Disputing Heritage Parties are unable to
agree on a site, the arbitrators shall select a site. The arbitrators shall have
the authority to establish rules and procedures governing the arbitration
hearing. The LP and the Disputing Heritage Parties shall have the opportunity to
present evidence at the hearing. The arbitrators may call for the submission of
pre-hearing statements of position and legal authority. The arbitration panel
shall not have the authority to award punitive or exemplary damages, nor shall
the arbitration panel have any authority to terminate this Agreement unless that
issue is made subject to arbitration under the express terms of this Agreement.
The arbitrators' decision must be rendered within 30 days following the
conclusion of the hearing or submission of evidence, but no later than 90 days
after appointment of the third arbitrator.

         3.4 ARBITRATION DECISION. The decision of the arbitrators, or a
majority of them, shall be in writing and shall be final and binding upon the
Parties as to the issue submitted. The LP and the Disputing Heritage Parties
shall bear the expense and cost of its attorneys and witnesses. The expense and
cost of the arbitrators shall be paid by the


                               Exhibit 10.10 - 2

                                                          CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

LP, on the one hand, and the Disputing Heritage Parties, on the other hand,
equally, or as the arbitrators may otherwise determine is just and equitable.

         3.5 ENFORCEMENT OF AWARD. Judgment upon any award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing
Party or Parties shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees in any court
proceeding necessary to enforce or collect any award or judgment rendered by the
arbitrators.
