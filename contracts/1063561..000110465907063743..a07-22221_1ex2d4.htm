cash plus (b) one-half in Holdings Stock, with the number of shares of
Holdings Stock calculated as follows:

  

(i) That number of shares of Holdings Common Stock which is equal to 19.9% of
the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Holdings Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with each share of Holdings Common
Stock valued, for this purpose, at $5.00 per share (the " _Measurement Price_
"); and

  

(ii) That number of shares of Holdings Preferred Stock which is equal to
([(x) minus (y)] divided by (z)) where (x) equals one-half of the Merger
Consideration, (y) equals the number of shares of Holdings Common Stock
issued upon the Closing Date pursuant to subsection (i) above multiplied by
the Measurement Price, and (z) equals the Original Issue Price (as such
term is defined in the Certificate of Designation).

  

For purposes of example only, assuming that (a) the Merger Consideration is
$104 million, (b) the Original Issue Price is $25.00 per share, and (c)
immediately prior to the Effective Time the total number of issued and
outstanding shares of Holdings Common Stock is 9,515,000, then (x) will equal
$52,000,000 (i.e. ½ of $104,000,000), (y) will equal $9,467,425 (i.e.
1,893,485 shares (representing 19.9% of 9,515,000) multiplied by $5.00 per
share); (z) will equal $25.00; (x) minus (y) will equal $42,532,575 (i.e.
$52,000,000 minus $9,467,425); and ([(x) minus (y)] divided by (z)) will
equal 1,701,303 (i.e. $42,532,575 divided by $25.00). Therefore, the Merger
Consideration would be payable at Closing in the form of $52 million in cash;
1,893,485 shares of Holdings Common Stock; and 1,701,303 shares of Holdings
Preferred Stock.

        

(e) The Merger Consideration shall be allocated in accordance with _Schedule_
_ 2.3(e)_ of this Agreement.

  

(f) Each certificate evidencing any shares of Holdings Common Stock to be
issued as part of the Merger Consideration shall bear the following legend:

  

"THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER

DISPOSITION OF THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED HEREBY OR ANY PORTION THEREOF OR
INTEREST THEREIN, MAY NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THAT ACT OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY
IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE TO THE COMPANY TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS
NOT REQUIRED."

  

(g) All Holdings Common Stock issued as part of the Merger Consideration
(including Holdings Common Stock issuable (subject to _Section 8.2_ below)
upon conversion of Holdings Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to

Merger Consideration is duly authorized and, upon issuance in accordance with
the terms hereof, shall by duly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and

reference therein, being hereinafter referred to as the " _SEC Documents_ ").
 None of Holdings subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports

and regulations promulgated thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed.

material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.  Such Holdings
Consolidated Financial Statements are true, correct and complete in all
material respects and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby (except (i) as may

the notes thereto, or (ii) in the case of unaudited interim statements, to
the extent they may exclude footnotes or may be condensed or summary
statements) and, fairly present in all material respects the financial
position of Holdings as of the dates thereof and the results of its

in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Except as set forth on

material liabilities of any nature except for liabilities reflected or

of Holdings most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q), and liabilities
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

5.7 _Brokers_. Neither Holdings nor Sub has paid or become obligated to pay
any fee or commission to any broker, finder or intermediary for or on account
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

5.8 _Solvency_. Assuming, for purposes of this Section 5.8 only, that the
Historical Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects the
financial position of the Acquired Entities as of the Effective Time, then
Holdings and the Surviving Entity will be Solvent as of

        

the Effective Time. For purposes of this Section 5.8, the term
"Solvent" means, as to the Surviving Entity, that, as of any date of
determination, (a) the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of the
Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such
date, the sum of (i) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving Entity and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other
liabilities, as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with the applicable federal Laws governing determinations of
the solvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liabilities of the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and matured; (b) the Surviving Entity will not have, as of
such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
business in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged by Holdings
following such date; and (c) the Surviving Entity will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.
For purposes of this Section 5.8, the term "Solvent" means, as to Holdings,

value of the assets of Holdings and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
exceeds, as of such date, the sum of (i) the value of all liabilities of

other liabilities, as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with the applicable federal Laws governing
determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be

5.9 _No Omissions or Misstatements_.  To the Knowledge of Holdings, this
Agreement and the Schedules hereto delivered by Holdings and Sub do not

fact necessary to make the statements made in this Agreement by Holdings or
Sub not misleading.

  

5.10 _Sarbanes-Oxley_.  Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
American Stock Exchange. Holdings has designed disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Holdings,
including its subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer of Holdings by others within those entities.
Holdings has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to Holdings auditors and the audit committee of Holdings Board of
Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Holdings
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Holdings
internal controls over financial reporting. Holdings has not received any
complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters, including any such complaint regarding questionable accounting or
auditing matters, and Holdings has not identified any material weaknesses in
the design or operation of

        

internal controls over financial reporting. To the Knowledge of Holdings,
there is no reason to believe that its auditors and its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, when
first due. There are not outstanding loans made by Holdings or any of its
subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of Holdings.

on its behalf, in a timely manner with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities all Returns which were required to be filed by or on behalf of

complete in all material respects. All Taxes of Holdings and each of its
Affiliates (whether or not shown on any Returns) due and owing prior to the
date of this Agreement have been paid in full or otherwise have been (or will
be) adequately reserved for in the Holdings Consolidated Financial Statements
and/or any subsequent financial statements of Holdings for the periods
relevant for such Tax period, and all Taxes of Holdings and its Affiliates

Affiliates with respect to Taxes, other than Permitted Encumbrances.

investigations or claims for or relating to any liability in respect of Taxes
with any Governmental Authority, and (iii) there are no matters under
discussion by any of Holdings or its Affiliates with any Governmental
Authority with respect to Taxes that may result in an additional amount of
Taxes for which Holdings or its Affiliates may have any liability.

  

(c) Except as set forth in the SEC Documents, neither Holdings nor any of its
Affiliates has made any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a
party to any agreement that under certain circumstances could obligate it to

corresponding provision of state or local law), or (iii) that would not be

agreed to by or on behalf of Holdings or its Affiliates.

  

5.13 _No Material Adverse Change_.  Except as set forth in the SEC Documents
or in Schedule 5.13, since the date of Holdings most recent audited Holdings
Consolidated Financial Statements, neither Holdings nor Sub has suffered a
material adverse effect, and Holdings does not have Knowledge of any fact or
circumstance reasonably likely to cause a Holdings Material Adverse Effect.

  

5.14 _Financing_. Holdings has delivered to the Shareholders true and
complete copies of (i) the commitment letter (as the same may be amended

Merger Consideration and any other repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitments and to pay
all related fees and expenses. As of the date of this Agreement,
Holdings does not, to its Knowledge, have any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt
Financing will not be available to Holdings on the Closing Date.

  

5.15 _AMEX_. AMEX has telephonically advised Holdings that, other than as
contemplated by _Section 8.2_ hereof, AMEX does not require that Holdings

Entities may update the Schedules to this Agreement to promptly disclose
matters which, if not disclosed, would cause a representation or warranty of
the Acquired Entities contained in this Agreement to be untrue as of the

Holdings Stock being issued to Shareholders as a portion of the Merger
Consideration shall, in the event of the conversion of the Holdings Preferred
Stock into Holdings Common Stock, exceed twenty percent of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Holdings Common Stock outstanding prior to the
Effective Time.  Accordingly, Holdings covenants and agrees that:**

  

(a) Holdings shall take all action in accordance with the United States
federal securities laws, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"),
Holdings Certificate of Incorporation and Holdings By-Laws necessary to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the holders
of Holdings Common Stock ("Holdings Stockholders Meeting") to be held on the
earliest practicable date determined in consultation with the Shareholders to
submit for approval by the requisite vote of such holders, in accordance with
the rules of the American Stock Exchange, a proposal to authorize (i) the
convertibility of Holdings Preferred Stock into Holdings Common Stock as
required, pursuant to the Certificate of Designation, as a condition to the
convertibility of Holdings Preferred Stock and (ii) the change of control of
Holdings and/or any other action required by the American Stock Exchange to
be approved by the stockholders of Holdings in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent

shall take all lawful actions to solicit the approval of Conversion Approval
Proposal, and the Board of Directors of Holdings shall recommend approval of
the Conversion Approval Proposal. Holdings shall ensure that the Holdings
Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited in connection therewith are solicited in
compliance with all applicable Laws.

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Holdings shall, as soon
as reasonable practicable, prepare the proxy statement to be filed with the
SEC in connection with the Holdings Stockholders Meeting (the "Proxy

efforts to mail at the earliest practicable date to the holders of Holdings
Common

        

Stock the Proxy Statement, which Proxy Statement shall include all
information required under applicable Laws to be furnished to the holders of
Holdings Common Stock in connection with the Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Holdings (i)
shall provide Shareholders reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response and (ii) shall accept all reasonable comments
proposed by Shareholders. Holdings shall as soon as reasonably practicable
(i) notify Shareholders of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment

respect to the Proxy Statement.

  

(c) Unless and until the Conversion Approval Proposal is approved and adopted
by the requisite vote of the stockholders of Holdings, upon the prior written
request of the Shareholders (and only upon such request), Holdings shall
resubmit such proposal for stockholder approval and adoption at any future
annual meetings of its stockholders, and at one additional special meeting of
its stockholders per year convened at the request of any holder or holders of
15% of the outstanding Holdings Preferred Stock; it being agreed and
understood by Holdings that, other than at the Holdings Stockholders
Meeting, Holdings shall not seek stockholder approval of the Conversion
Approval Proposal absent the written request of the Shareholders.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, within twenty (20) business
days after a request for a special meeting of stockholders made in accordance
with the foregoing, Holdings shall file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy
Statement with respect to such special meeting and shall use its best efforts
to cause such Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC and to hold such
special meeting as promptly as practicable thereafter; and Holdings shall
otherwise comply with all of the provisions of Section 8.2(b) with respect to
the Proxy Statement. In connection with each meeting of stockholders at
which the Conversion Approval Proposal is submitted for a vote of the
stockholders of Holdings, the Board of Directors of Holdings shall recommend
to the stockholders that they vote in favor of such Conversion Approval
Proposal, and Holdings shall use its best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder approval necessary for the approval and adoption of
the Conversion Approval Proposal.

  

(d) From the Closing Date until such date, if ever, upon which Holdings
issues the Conversion Stock, Holdings shall at all times maintain (and shall
not issue shares of Holdings Common Stock if Holdings would not have) a
reserve from its duly authorized shares of Holdings Common Stock for issuance
pursuant to the Certificate of Designation in such amount equal to 130% of
the number of shares of Holdings Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
outstanding shares of Holdings Preferred Stock.

  

8.3 _Holdings AMEX Filing_. Shareholders acknowledge that they have
been advised by Holdings that the rules of the American Stock Exchange
require that Holdings file a listing application to provide for the Holdings
Common Stock being issued to Shareholders as a part of the Merger
Consideration. Accordingly, Holdings shall promptly take all action in
accordance with the rules of the American Stock Exchange (including Section
341 of the Amex Company

        

Guide) and applicable Law to cause all of the shares of Holdings Common Stock
to be issued to Shareholders hereunder (as well as, following any approval of
the Conversion Approval Proposal, the Conversion Stock) to be approved for
listing on AMEX, upon official notice of issuance thereof.

  

8.4 _Right to Designate Two Directors At Effective Time_. At the Effective
Time, the Shareholders shall, as the holders of the Holdings Preferred Stock,
collectively have the right to designate two directors to serve on Holdings
Board of Directors until the next election of directors (subject to any
restrictions under applicable law or the rules and requirements of any
securities exchange upon which any of Holdings securities may be traded and
subject to satisfactory completion of Holdings Directors and Officers
Questionnaire). One of the two designees must meet the requirements of
"independent director" for all purposes under the rules and regulations of
the American Stock Exchange and the SEC and obtain the approval of a majority
of the remaining members of Holdings Board of Directors. This director
designation right is personal to the holders of the Holdings Preferred Stock
and cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred. Shareholders shall inform
Holdings of their proposed designees at least 45 days prior to the Closing
Date. Upon receipt of the names of the proposed designees, Holdings shall
promptly provide such designees a copy of Holdings Directors and Officers
Questionnaire for completion. Shareholders shall cause such
proposed designees to complete and return the Directors and Officers
Questionnaire to Holdings within 10 days of their receipt of such
Questionnaire. Holdings shall be entitled to conduct reasonable diligence of
the proposed designees as necessary to assist in its evaluation of such

and regulation of the American Stock Exchange. Shareholders and Holdings

8.6 _[INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]_.

  

8.7 _Post-Closing Access_. Holdings and Shareholders acknowledge
that, subsequent to the Closing, Holdings and Shareholders may each need
access to information, documents or computer data in the control or
possession of the other (or their respective Affiliates), and Shareholders
may need access to the Hospitals or other assets of the Acquired Entities for
purposes of concluding the transactions contemplated herein and for audits,
investigations, compliance with governmental requirements, regulations and
requests, and the prosecution or defense of third party claims.  Holdings
agrees that, at the sole cost and expense of the Shareholders, it will make
available to Shareholders, their Affiliates and their
respective representatives, agents and independent auditors such documents
and information as may be in the possession of Holdings and its Affiliates
relating to periods prior to the Effective Time and will permit Shareholders,
their Affiliates and their respective representatives, agents and independent
auditors, to make copies of such documents and information.  Each
Shareholder agrees that, at the sole cost and expense of Holdings, such
Shareholder will make available to Holdings, its Affiliates and
their respective representatives, agents and independent auditors, such
documents and information as may be in the possession of such Shareholder and
its Affiliates relating to periods prior to the Effective Time and will
permit Holdings, its Affiliates and their respective representatives, agents
and independent auditors to make copies of such documents and information.

        

8.8 _Tax Matters_.

  

(a) _Income Tax Returns_. The Shareholders will be responsible for causing
the preparation and filing of all income tax Returns of the Acquired Entities
for any taxable period during which the Company qualified as a subchapter S
corporation within the meaning of Section 1361 et seq. of the Code and any
analogous state or local provision.  Prior to the Closing Date, the
Shareholders shall provide to Holdings a statement (the " _Estimated Dividend
Statement_ ") which shall set forth the estimated amounts of the Companys
"items of income" and "nonseparately computed income" (as such terms are
defined under Section 1366(a)(1) of the Code) attributable to the period from
January 1, 2007 through the end of the Closing Date. At or before the
Closing Date, the Company shall distribute pro rata among the outstanding
shares of the Company an amount (the "Tax Distribution Amount") equal to the
excess, if any, of (i) 45 percent of the sum of the Companys items of income
and nonseparately computed income as shown on the Estimated Dividend
Statement over (ii) the aggregate amount of any dividend distributions
declared and paid to the Shareholders in 2007 ("2007 Distributions"). Within
90 days after the Closing Date, Shareholders shall provide Holdings with a
Pro Forma IRS Form 1120S (the " _Final Pro Forma Return_ "), which shall set
forth the amounts of the Companys items of income and nonseparately computed
income for the period from January 1, 2007 through the Closing Date. Within
30 days of the receipt of the Final Pro Forma Return by Holdings, Holdings
shall notify the Shareholders of any reasonable objections Holdings may have
to the Final Pro Forma Return and Holdings and the Shareholders shall use
their respective best efforts to consult and resolve in good faith any such
objection. If any such disagreement cannot be resolved, Holdings and the
Shareholders will submit the dispute to the Selected Accounting Firm, whose
decision shall be binding and conclusive on the parties. Any expenses
relating to the engagement of the Selected Accounting Firm shall be shared
equally by Shareholders and Holdings. If the sum of the amounts of items of
income and nonseparately computed income shown on the Estimated Dividend
Statement is less than the sum of such amounts shown on the Final Pro Forma
Return (after taking into account any adjustments to the Final Pro Forma
Return as agreed to by the parties), Holdings shall promptly pay to
the Shareholders (allotted to such shareholders in accordance with
their shareholdings in the Company as of the Closing Date) an amount (if
positive) equal to (i) 45% of the sum of such amounts shown on the Final Pro
Forma Return less (ii) the aggregate amount of the 2007 Distributions, if
any, less (y) the Tax Distribution Amount, if any. If the sum of the amounts
of items of income and nonseparately computed income shown on the Final Pro
Forma Return (after taking into account any adjustments to the Final Pro
Forma Return as agreed to by the parties) is less than the sum of such
amounts shown on the Estimated Dividend Statement, each Shareholder
shall promptly pay to Holdings his allocable share of an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) 45 percent of such excess or (ii) the amount of the Tax
Distribution.

  

(b) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, the Shareholders
and Holdings will:

        

(i) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file
Returns or other reports with respect to sales, transfer and similar Taxes;

  

(ii) assist the other party in preparing any Return which such other party is
responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with this _Section 8.8_
(including providing the other party with reasonable access to financial
records for such purposes and the execution of any Returns or extensions
thereto);

  

(iii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with taxing
authorities regarding, any Returns of the Acquired Entities (including the
execution of any powers of attorney to allow for the party responsible for
defending the audit or dispute to represent the Acquired Entities); and

  

(iv) make available to the other party and to any taxing authority as
reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to
Taxes of the Acquired Entities.

  

(c) _Preservation of Tax-Free Treatment of the Merger_.  After the Closing
Date, neither Shareholders nor Holdings or any of its Affiliates shall take
any action, or fail to take any action, that may adversely affect the
treatment of the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. Holdings shall, and shall cause each of
its Affiliates to, take the position for all purposes that the Merger
qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and
shall use its best efforts to defend any challenges by a Governmental
Authority to the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization under
section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Holdings nor any of its Affiliates guarantees or warrants the tax-
free treatment of the Merger.

  

8.9 _Non-Competition_.

  

(a) Except as permitted in _Section 8.9(b)_ during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the first to occur of (i) four (4) years
from the Closing Date or (ii) three and one-half (3 1/2) years following the
termination of such Shareholders employment with Holdings or any Affiliate
of Holdings, each Shareholder agree that he, she or it shall not, directly or
indirectly, (i) engage in the operation of any Competing Business located
within the Territory, or (ii) acquire, lease, construct, develop or own any
Competing Business located within the Territory, or (iii) be a director,
officer, trustee, associate, consultant, principal, agent, contractor,
employee, shareholder, partner, member or equity holder of, exercise
management control over, or acquire or maintain an ownership interest in, any
entity that is engaged in any Competing Business within the Territory (items
(i) through (iii) collectively, " _Restricted Activities_ ").

  

(b) The Restricted Activities shall not prohibit either Shareholder from
owning up to five percent (5%) of any class of securities of any publicly
traded company, whether or not it is a Competing Business.

  

(c) Each Shareholder recognizes that the covenants in this _Section 8.9_,
and the territorial, time and other limitations with respect thereto, are
reasonable and properly required

        

for the adequate protection of the acquisition of the Company Shares by
Holdings, and agrees that such limitations are reasonable with respect to its
activities, business and public purpose. Each Shareholder agrees and
acknowledges that the violation of the covenants or agreements in this
_Section 8.9_ would cause irreparable injury to Holdings and that the remedy
at law for any violation or threatened violation thereof would be inadequate
and that, in addition to whatever other remedies may be available at law or
in equity, Holdings shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive
or other equitable relief without the necessity of proving actual damages or
posting bond. The parties hereto also waive any requirement of proving actual
damages in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief.

  

(d) It is the intention of each party hereto that the provisions of this
_Section 8.9_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the
laws and the public policies of the state of California, but that the
unenforceability (or the modification to conform with such laws or public
policies) of any provisions hereof shall not render unenforceable or impair
the remainder of this Agreement. Accordingly, if any term or provision of
this _Section 8.9_ shall be determined to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, either in whole or in part, this Agreement shall be deemed
amended to delete or modify, as necessary, the offending provisions and to
alter the balance of this Agreement in order to render the same valid
and enforceable to the fullest extent permissible as aforesaid.

  

8.10 _Title Report and Survey; Defects and Cure; Title Policy_.

  

(a) _Title Report_. Within seven (7) days following the request of Holdings
or Holdings lender, the Company shall cause to be furnished to Holdings and
Holdings lender a preliminary title report (" _Title Report_ ") for the Real
Property together with legible copies of all exceptions to title referenced
therein, issued by First American Title Insurance Company (the " _Title
Company_ ").

  

(b) _Survey_. The Company shall cooperate with Holdings and Holdings lender
if Holdings lender, requests a survey of the Real Property, to enable
Holdings or Holdings lender to obtain an ALTA title insurance
policy insuring title, or the lenders lien, respectively, on the Real
Property.

  

(c) _Defects and Cure_. The Title Report and the survey are collectively
referred to as " _Title Evidence_ ". Holdings shall notify the Company in
writing within twenty (20) days after its receipt of the last of each
component of the Title Evidence for each Hospital of any material liens,
claims, encroachments, exceptions or defects disclosed in the Title Evidence
to which Holdings or Holdings lender objects, other than any Permitted
Encumbrances (collectively, " _Defects_ "). The Company, at its sole cost
and expense, shall cure any such Defects on or before Closing (" _cure_
" shall include an endorsement to an owners or a leasehold policy of
title insurance, as applicable, acceptable to Holdings, either eliminating
the Defect, insuring over the Defect or insuring against the effect of the
Defect or an agreement by Shareholders that is acceptable to Holdings and
Holdings lender to indemnify Holdings and/or Holdings lender, as
applicable, with respect to the Defect) or the Company may elect to not cure
the objections and shall give written notice to Holdings and Holdings lender
within thirty (30) days of its receipt of Holdings notice of Defects of
its decision. Within 30 days of Holdings receipt of notice from the Company
of uncured Defects, Holdings may waive such uncured Defects and close or may

        

terminate this Agreement as if it were a termination pursuant to _Section
12.1_. If the Company fails to timely give such notice, the Company shall be
deemed to have elected not to cure the Defects, whereupon Holdings may waive
such Defects and close, or may terminate this Agreement.

  

(d) At the Closing, the Company shall cooperate with Holdings in obtaining,
to the extent Holdings requests, an ALTA Form Owners Title Policy or
Leasehold Policy, as applicable, (the " _Title Policy_ ") for any or all
portions of the Real Property; provided, however, that if Holdings lender
requests a form of Title Policy different than the foregoing, then Holdings
shall accept Title Policies in a form reasonably consistent with any policies
issued for Holdings lender. Subject to the foregoing, the Title Policies
shall be issued as of the Closing Date in an amount equal to the portion of
the Merger Consideration being allocated to such portion of the Real Property
and shall insure to the applicable Acquired Entity good and marketable fee
simple or leasehold title, as the case may be, to such Real Property, subject
only to the (i) Permitted Encumbrances and (ii) taxes for the current and
subsequent years "not yet due and payable." The Title Policy shall have all
standard and general exceptions deleted so as to afford full "extended form
coverage" and shall contain such endorsements as Holdings shall
reasonably require in connection with its review of the Title Report and the
Surveys. The Company shall execute such certificates and affidavits as may be
reasonably necessary in connection with the issuance of the Title Policies as
described in this _Section 8.10(d)_. The Company shall pay all premiums,
costs and expenses of that portion of the Title Policies equal to the cost of
a CLTA Owners Policy, with Holdings paying any costs exceeding such to
acquire an ALTA Owners Title Policy or any policy for Holdings lender.

  

(e) The Company will cooperate with Holdings and Holdings lender should a
request be made for estoppel certificates or subordination for some or all of
the Leases.

  

8.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, Holdings and the Company
shall take all such action as may be required to cause any acquisitions of
shares of Holdings Common Stock and Holdings Preferred Stock resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including upon conversion of
the Holdings Preferred Stock), or dispositions of Holdings Preferred Stock to
Holdings, by the Shareholders to be exempt from the short-swing profit
liability rules of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3

Shareholders shall not be obligated to indemnify any Holdings Indemnitee for
any Holdings Indemnifiable Damages prior to the Holdings Indemnitees, in the
aggregate, satisfying a cumulative total deductible of Eight Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($800,000) (" _Indemnification Threshold_ ") after which the
Shareholders shall be obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Holdings Indemnitees for all Holdings Indemnificable Damages above and
beyond such amount subject to _(x)_ with respect to claims asserted on or
before January 2, 2008, a maximum aggregate liability amount of Ten percent
(10%) of the Merger Consideration and _(y)_  with respect to claims asserted
after January 2, 2008, a maximum aggregate liability amount of Five percent
(5%) of the Merger Consideration (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "). No Holdings
Indemnitee may obtain indemnification for any Holdings Indemnifiable Damages
to which this _Section 11.2_ relates unless such Holdings Indemnitee has made
a claim for indemnification within the Indemnification Period defined in
_Section 11.1_ , except as otherwise provided in _Section 11.4_. The
Shareholders may satisfy their indemnification obligation to the Holdings
Indemnitees by payment of Holdings Indemnifiable Damages half in cash and
half by returning Holdings Common Stock and/or Holdings Preferred Stock for
cancellation, except that, prior to the approval by the stockholders of
Holdings of the Conversion Approval Proposal, the Shareholders may satisfy
their indemnification obligation to the Holdings Indemnitees by payment of
Holdings Indemnifiable Damages by returning Holdings Preferred Stock for
cancellation. With respect to any Holdings Common Stock returned for
cancellation hereunder, such Common Stock shall be assigned a value
equivalent to the value used to calculate the number of shares of Holdings
Common Stock issued as part of the Merger Consideration under _Section 2.3_.
With respect to any Holdings Preferred Stock returned for cancellation
hereunder, such Holdings Preferred Stock shall be assigned a value equivalent
to the face amount thereof, together with any dividends which may have
accrued and not been paid thereon.

  

11.3 _Indemnification of the Shareholders_. Holdings, Sub and the Acquired
Entities jointly and severally, agree to hold harmless, defend and indemnify
each Shareholder (each, a " _Shareholder Indemnitee_ ") from and against any
and all damage, loss, liability and expense, net of any realizable Tax
benefit (including without limitation (A) reasonable expenses
of investigation and reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable expenses
in connection with any action, suit or proceeding, (B) any fees and expenses
in connection with the retention of counsel to pursue insurance coverage, (C)
any amounts paid to defend, litigate, settle, satisfy a judgment, or
otherwise resolve disputes with the insurance carrier, if any, or the
claimant, and (D) all amounts not covered by insurance incurred or suffered
by any the Shareholders) arising out of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Holdings or Sub
set forth in this Agreement or (ii) any failure by Holdings or Sub to perform
or comply with any covenant contained in this Agreement that is required to
be performed or complied with by Holdings or Sub as set forth in this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Shareholder Indemnifiable Damages_ ").
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Holdings, Sub nor any of
the Acquired Entities shall be obligated to indemnify any Shareholder
Indemnitee for Shareholder Indemnifiable Damages _(x)_ prior to the
Shareholders, in the aggregate, satisfying the Indemnification Threshold or 
_(y)_ in an amount that exceeds in the aggregate the Indemnification Cap;
provided, however, that neither the Indemnification Threshold nor the
Indemnification Cap shall apply to any Shareholder Indemnifiable Damages
resulting from or attributable to any

        

breach of the covenants made by Holdings and its Affiliates under _Section
8.8(c)_ of this Agreement, if such breach arises as a result of the
intentional misconduct or gross negligence of Holdings and/or its Affiliates.
 No Shareholder Indemnitee may obtain indemnification for any
Shareholder Indemnifiable Damages to which this _Section 10.3_ relates unless
such Shareholder Indemnitee makes a claim for indemnification within
the Indemnification Period defined in _Section 11.1_.

  

11.4 _Exclusion of Holdings Indemnifiable Damages from Indemnification
Period, Indemnification Threshold and Indemnification Cap_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,

  

(a) neither the Indemnification Threshold nor the Indemnification Cap shall
apply to limit Holdings Indemnifiable Damages with respect to claims of any
Holdings Indemnitee (i) arising out of or related to any inaccuracy or breach
of the representations, and warranties set forth in this Agreement under
_Sections 3.1_ , 4.1(b), 4.1(c), 4.1(d), 4.2(c) _, 4.2(d) and 4.2(e)_
, (collectively, " _Title Claims_ ") or (ii) based upon any
fraudulent misrepresentation by the Shareholders of any representations and
warranties in this Agreement (collectively, " _Fraud Claims_ ") or (iii)
arising out of the indemnification obligations of Shareholders set forth in
subparagraph (c) of this Section 11.4, subject to the limitations set forth
therein (" _Special Litigation Claims_ "); provided however, that in no event
shall the aggregate amount of Holdings Indemnifiable Damages hereunder exceed
the Merger Consideration:

  

(b) Each Shareholder shall remain liable and obligated under this Article XI
to indemnify any and all Holdings Indemnitees:

  

(i) for claims arising out of or related to any inaccuracy or breach of
the representations and warranties, set forth in this Agreement under
_Sections 4.13_ and 4.17 (collectively, " _Licensure Claims_ ") for a period
of three (3) years from the Closing Date; provided, however, that, with
respect to any Licensure Claim asserted following the expiration of the
Indemnification Period, the phrase "to the Knowledge of Company" shall be
deemed to be inserted prior to each of the representations and warranties in
Sections _4.13_ and 4.17 (for example, the first sentence of Section 4.17(a)
would read in its entirety: "To the Knowledge of Company, the Acquired
Entities possess all Material Permits required or necessary to operate the
Business and all such Permits are valid, and in good standing."); and

  

(ii) for Title Claims, Fraud Claims, Special Litigation Claims and for claims
arising out of or related to any inaccuracy or breach of the representations,
and warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement under
_Sections 4._ 14 and 8.8, until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations, or if there is no applicable statute of limitations, then
such claims shall have no expiration date.

  

(c) Each Shareholder shall remain liable and obligated under this Article XI
to indemnify any and all Holdings Indemnitees, on a pro-rata basis, with
respect to the litigation case described as lawsuit #3 on Schedule 4.19 of
the Company Disclosure Schedules (the " _Special Litigation_ ") for any
Litigation Payments (as hereinafter defined), subject to the following:

        

(i) Upon any Court Order and/or settlement in the Special Litigation, which
Court Order and/or settlement requires payments to be made by the
Shareholders (or an Affiliate of a Shareholder) and/or a Holdings Indemnitee
(whether in the form of cash or otherwise) (the " _Litigation Payments_ "),
the Litigation Payments (in whatever form required, whether cash or
otherwise) shall be made solely by the Shareholders, who shall make such
Litigation Payments on behalf of the Holdings Indemnitees to the extent that
the Holdings Indemnitees are otherwise responsible therefor under the terms
of the applicable Court Order and/or settlement.

  

(ii) Concurrently with or promptly following the delivery of any Litigation
Payments by the Shareholders pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this Section
11.4(c), Holdings shall reimburse the paying Shareholders for any such
Litigation Payments on a pro-rata basis in an aggregate amount not to exceed
a maximum of $1,500,000 via wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account (or accounts) designated by the Shareholders (the "Holdings
Reimbursement").

  

(iii) In the event of any payment, contribution or reimbursement from any
insurance company with respect to any Litigation Payments (collectively,
"Insurance Recoveries"), Holdings and Sub shall promptly cause the Insurance
Recoveries to be paid to the Shareholders up to the aggregate amount of any
Litigation Payments made by the Shareholders _less_ the amount of the
Holdings Reimbursement, and any excess amount thereof shall be distributed to
Holdings; it being understood by the parties that, to the extent Insurance
Recoveries are available under any insurance policy with respect to any
Litigation Payments, Holdings and Sub shall undertake a good faith effort to
make a claim under such insurance policy and use its reasonable best efforts
to pursue such claim, subject to Section 11.4(c)(v).

  

(iv) In the event that the Shareholders make any Litigation Payments for
which they are not reimbursed either by Holdings pursuant to subsection (ii)
of this Section 11.4(c) or by the Insurance Recoveries pursuant to subsection
(iii) of this Section 11.4(c) (collectively, " _Gap Payments_ "), then the
following provisions shall apply:

  

(1) Holdings and Sub shall promptly cause any Extraordinary Collections (as
defined below) to be distributed to the Shareholders in an amount not to
exceed the aggregate amount of the Gap Payments.

  

(2) Any Extraordinary Collections in excess of the aggregate amount of the
Gap Payments shall be retained by the Acquired Entities.

  

(3) The Holdings Indemnitees shall have no obligation whatsoever to reimburse
the Shareholders for Gap Payments other than from Extraordinary Collections.

  

(4) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Extraordinary Collections"
shall mean the aggregate amount of net proceeds received by any of the
Acquired Entities (or Holdings or any of its Affiliates) after the Closing
Date, relating to the reimbursement projects currently being performed by
Blumberg Ribner, Inc., relating to years 1992 through 2005 (as listed on
_Exhibit O_ hereto), pursuant to the Agreements for Reimbursement Consulting
Services, dated February 8, 2007 and June 1, 2007 between Blumberg Ribner,
Inc. and Alta Hollywood Hospitals, inc. and Alta Los Angeles Hospitals, Inc.

        

(v) For purposes of defending the Special Litigation Claims pursuant to
Section 11.6 of this Agreement, the Shareholders shall be deemed to be the
Indemnitor and the Holdings Indemnitees shall be deemed to be the Indemnitee;
provided, however, that solely for purposes of the payment of any litigation
costs relative to the Special Litigation and/or Insurance Recoveries, the
Surviving Entity shall be deemed to be the Indemnitor and the responsible
party.

  

(vi) It is the intent of the parties that the rights of the Holdings
Indemnitees to recover Holdings Indemnifiable Damages from the Shareholders
and/or their Affiliates with respect to the Special Litigation shall be
expressly subject to the provisions of this Section 11.4. Accordingly, in
no event shall the Shareholders be obligated to indemnify any Holdings
Indemnitees for any damage, loss, liability or expense relating to or arising
out of any inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations and warranties
of the Shareholders or the Acquired Entities set forth in this Agreement
insofar as any such inaccuracy or breach arises as a result of the Special
Litigation.

  

11.5 _Claims Timely Raised But Not Resolved_. Any claim timely made within
the Indemnification Period, or such longer periods applicable under
_Section 11.4_ , but are still pending or unresolved at the end of the
Indemnification Period, or such longer period under _Section 11.4_ , will
continue to be covered by this Article XI until the claim has been resolved
and any amounts payable under this Article XI are finally determined and
paid.

  

11.6 _Indemnification Procedures_. A party seeking indemnification (the "
_Indemnitee_ ") shall use its best efforts to minimize any liabilities,
damages, deficiencies, claims, judgments, assessments, costs and expenses in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement. The
Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice (a " _Notice_ ") to the party
from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnitor") of any event that
could give rise to an indemnification claim under this Agreement, including
the assertion or commencement of any claim, audit, examination or other
proposed change or adjustment by any Governmental Authority with respect to
Taxes (a " _Claim_ "). No such Notice of a Claim shall satisfy
the requirements of this _Section 11.6_ unless it describes in
reasonable detail and in good faith the facts and circumstances of the Claim,
to the extent known by Indemnitee, and Indemnitee provides copies of any
notice or other document received in respect of any Claim. The Indemnitee
shall have twenty (20) calendar days from the receipt of the Notice to decide
whether to defend such Claim. During such period, the Indemnitee shall take
all necessary steps to protect the interests of itself and the Indemnitor,
including the filing of any necessary responsive pleadings, the seeking of
provisional relief or other action necessary to maintain the status quo,
subject to reimbursement from the Indemnitor of its expenses in doing so. The
Indemnitor shall (with, if necessary, reservation of rights) control the
defense of such Claim, using counsel selected by the insurance company
insuring against any such Claim and undertaking to defend such Claim, or by
other counsel selected by it and approved by the Indemnitee, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The
Indemnitor shall keep the Indemnitee fully apprised at all times of the
status of the defense and shall consult with the Indemnitee prior to the
settlement of any indemnified matter. The Indemnitee agrees to use
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Indemnitor in connection with its
defense of any Claims.

        

In the event the Indemnitee has a claim or claims against any third party
arising out of or connected with an indemnified matter, then upon receipt of
indemnification, the Indemnitee shall fully assign to the Indemnitor the
entire claim or claims to the extent of the indemnification actually paid by
the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor shall thereupon be subrogated with respect
to such claim or claims of the Indemnitee.

  

11.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing Date, the rights and
remedies of the parties under this Article XI shall be the sole and
exclusive rights and remedies of the parties with respect to any matters
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than as a result of Fraud Claims. EACH
PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES AND DISCHARGES FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF AS,
APPLICABLE, ALL INDEMNITEES, ALL RIGHTS TO ALL PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
CONSEQUENTIAL, DIRECT OR INDIRECT OR OTHER DAMAGES, HOWEVER CHARACTERIZED,
WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, OTHER THAN THOSE
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH UNDER THIS ARTICLE XI.

  

11.8 _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. Any payments made pursuant to
this Article XI shall be consistently treated as adjustments to Merger
Consideration for all Tax purposes by the parties.

  

 ** _ARTICLE XII 
 TERMINATION_**

  

12.1 _Termination Events_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to Closing upon prior written notice by the party electing to terminate this
Agreement to the other party:

  

(a) by mutual agreement of Shareholders and Holdings (expressed in writing);

  

(b) by either Shareholders or Holdings if any permanent injunction, Court
Order or other order, decree or ruling of any court or other Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall have been issued and become final and non-appealable.

  

(c) by either Shareholders or Holdings if the Closing shall not have occurred
by the sixtieth (60th) day following the date of this Agreement (the "
_Optional Termination Date_ "); provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 12.1_ shall not be available to
any party whose breach of its representations and warranties in this
Agreement or whose failure to perform any of its covenants and agreements
under this Agreement shall have caused, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or before the Optional Termination Date.

  

(d) by Shareholders upon a breach in any material respect of any covenant or
agreement on the part of the Holdings set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Holdings shall have been breached or shall
have become untrue, in any such case that the conditions set forth in
_Sections 10.1_ and _10.2_  would be incapable of being satisfied by the
Optional Termination Date (or any later termination date as may have been
determined by mutual agreement of the parties).

        

(e) by Holdings upon a breach in any material respect of any covenant or
agreement on the part of any Shareholders set forth in this Agreement, or if
any representation or warranty of any Shareholders shall have been breached
or shall have become untrue in any such case such that the conditions set
forth in _Sections 9.1_ and _9.2_  would be incapable of being satisfied by
the Optional Termination Date (or any later termination date as may have been
determined by mutual agreement of the parties).

  

(f) by Shareholders if it shall become apparent in Shareholders judgment
reasonably exercised that any condition to Shareholders obligation to close
as set forth in Article X hereof will not be satisfied on or before the
Optional Termination Date.

  

(g) by Holdings if it shall become apparent in Holdings judgment reasonably
exercised that any condition to Holdings obligation to close as set forth in
Article IX hereof will not be satisfied on or before the Optional Termination
Date.

  

(h) by Holdings if (i) Holdings is not in breach in any material respect of
Section 7.11 or any other terms of this Agreement; (ii) the Board of
Directors of Holdings (following receipt of a written opinion from Holdings
outside legal counsel that the termination of this Agreement is necessary in
order for such Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law) authorizes Holdings, subject to complying with the terms of this
Agreement, to enter into a binding written agreement providing for a
transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal and Holdings notifies the
Shareholders in writing that it intends to enter into such an agreement,
attaching the most current version of such agreement to such notice, which
agreement shall include all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal; and (iii) Holdings shall have paid to the Shareholders the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 12.5.

  

12.2 _Effect of Termination_. Each partys right of termination under
_Section 12.1_ is in addition to any other rights it may have under this
Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will not
be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 12.1_ , all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement
will terminate, except that (i) Sections 8.1, this Article 12, Article 14 and
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any such termination and (ii)
each party will redeliver to the party furnishing the same all documents,
work papers and other material of any other party relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after
the execution hereof; provided, however, that if this Purchase Agreement
is terminated by a party because of the breach of this Agreement by the
other party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating
partys obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the
other partys failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement,
the terminating partys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive
such termination unimpaired.

  

12.3 _Expense Reimbursement - Holdings_. Holdings shall reimburse the
Company for its reasonable, documented out of pocket expenses incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (not to
exceed $250,000) in the event this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing
for any reason other than:

        

(a) The material breach by the Company or Shareholders of any binding
obligation under this Agreement, provided that Holdings shall have notified
the Company promptly of its determination that any such material breach may
have occurred;

  

(b) Holdings reasonable determination that any Acquired Entity is not in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental rules
and regulations including, without limitation, those relating to health care,
provided that such non-compliance shall have a Business Material Adverse
Effect and provided further that Holdings shall have notified the Company
promptly of its determination that any such non-compliance may exist;

  

(c) There shall have been a Business Material Adverse Effect subsequent to
the Interim Balance Sheet Date, provided that Holdings shall have notified
the Company promptly of its determination that any such Business Material
Adverse Effect may exist; or

  

(d) The failure of shareholders to receive the opinion of Duane Morris LLP
described in Section 10.5 hereof, if the failure to receive such opinion is
due to the existence of any facts or law that was known or should reasonably
have been known by Shareholders or Duane Morris LLP at or prior to the date
hereof.

  

12.4 _Break-up Fee - Company_. The Company shall reimburse Holdings for
its reasonable, documented out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with
