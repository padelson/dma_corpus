Article II 
  
 Effects Of The Mergers

  



  

2.1 _Effect of the Company Merger on Membership Interests_. At the
Company Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Company Merger and
without any action on the part of any party or the holder of any of their
securities:

  



  

(a) _Membership Interests of Company Merger Sub_. All of the
limited liability company interests in Company Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall
remain outstanding and shall be converted into and shall represent a number
and series of Company Units of the Surviving Company corresponding to the
number and series of Company Units (other than any Blocker Owned Company
Units) outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, so
that, after the Company Merger Effective Time, Blocker and Parent shall be
the holders of all of the issued and outstanding Company Units of the
Surviving Company.

  



  

(b) _Merger Consideration; Membership Interests of the Company_.

  



  

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article II_ and without
duplication of any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ , all Company
Units (other than any Blocker Owned Company Units) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall be converted
into, in the aggregate, the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration the holder of such Company Units would have been entitled to
receive in accordance with the Company LLC Agreement in the event that all
Company Units (including Blocker Owned Company Units) were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (the " _Company Merger
Consideration Portion_ "). All Company Units, when so converted, shall cease
to be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist and no
holder thereof shall have any further rights with respect thereto.

  



  

(ii) All other membership interests or other equity securities of the
Company (other than the Blocker Owned Company Units) existing
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and cease to exist as of the Company Merger Effective Time and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable therefor.

  



  

2.2 _Effect of the Blocker Merger on Partnership Interests_. At
the Blocker Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Blocker Merger and
without any action on the part of any party or the holder of any of their
securities:

  



    

5

 



    



  

(a) _Membership Interests of Blocker Merger Sub_ All of the limited
liability company interests in Blocker Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Blocker Merger Effective Time shall
remain outstanding and shall be converted into and shall represent limited
liability company interests of the Surviving Blocker, so that, after the
Blocker Merger Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the
issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in the Surviving
Blocker.

  



  

(b) _Merger Consideration; Partnership Interests of Blocker_.
Subject to the other provisions of this _Article II_ , the limited
partner interests in Blocker issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Blocker Merger Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive,
in the aggregate, a portion of the Merger Consideration equal to the portion
that Blocker, as the holder of the Blocker Owned Company Units, would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the Blocker Owned Company Units
pursuant to the terms of the Company LLC Agreement in the event the Blocker
Owned Company Units converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration in the Company Merger (the " _Blocker Merger Consideration
Portion_ "), as determined in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)(i)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Blocker Merger Consideration Portion shall equal the
Merger Consideration, less the Company Merger Consideration Portion. All such
Blocker limited partner interests, when so converted, shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. The
general partner interest in Blocker issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Blocker Merger Effective Time shall be automatically canceled with no
consideration paid therefore.

  



  

2.3 _Merger Consideration; Determination of Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) The aggregate consideration payable with respect to both Mergers
taken together, shall consist of (i) an amount in Cash equal to the amount of
Available Cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), (ii) a number of shares of
newly-issued Parent Common Stock calculated by dividing (A) the excess of (x)
the Aggregate Purchase Price over (y) the Cash Consideration, by (B) a per
share issue price of $10.00 (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (iii) such a
number of Founder Shares transferred to the Selling Equityholders pursuant to
the Transfer Letter, as adjusted pursuant to the terms thereof (the " _Founder
Share Consideration_ ") (together with the Cash Consideration, the Stock
Consideration and the Founder Share Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 2.3(a)_ , if the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be (i) issued as Stock Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.3(a)_ and (ii) transferred to the Selling
Equityholders as Founder Share Consideration in accordance with the Transfer
Letter would exceed 35% of all outstanding capital stock of Parent at the time
of the Closing, then the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
as Stock Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.3(a)_ shall be reduced
by a number of shares (the " _Excess Shares_ ") necessary to cause the
percentage of outstanding capital stock of Parent represented by the Stock
Consideration and the Founder Shares Consideration to equal 35%, rounded up to
the nearest whole share. If any adjustment to the Stock Consideration is
required pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ , then the Selling
Equityholders shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of such Excess Shares,
future payments subject to the terms and conditions of _Section 2.9_.

(c) In the event of any change in the Parent Common Stock between
the date of this Agreement and the Company Merger Effective Time by reason of
any stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, combination, or exchange of shares, the Merger
Consideration to be paid as provided in this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted.

which comments Parent shall deliver to the Company no less than two (2)

"THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, IN WHOLE OR IN PART,
OTHER THAN PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION UNDER SAID ACT OR IN CONFORMITY WITH THE
LIMITATIONS OF RULE 144 OR OTHER EXEMPTION AS THEN IN EFFECT, WITHOUT FIRST

no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or

Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Company Units or Blocker
Partnership Interests pursuant to this Agreement, any amount required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by
the Surviving Blocker, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Units or Blocker Partnership
Interests, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and

Parent, as the case may be.

terminate all applicable obligations and liabilities of the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates related to the Credit Agreements, Company
Notes and other such Indebtedness identified in clause (iv) (such amounts in

(b) _Company Transaction Expenses_. At the Company Merger Effective
Time, Parent shall (on behalf of the Company) pay, or, to the extent the
Surviving Company has sufficient immediately available funds at such time,
instruct the Surviving Company to pay, all Company Transaction Expenses set

2.6 _Adjustment Amount_.

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date,
and in any event within seventy-five (75) calendar days following the date
thereof, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Seller Representative a schedule
(the " _Adjustment Schedule_ ") setting forth a calculation of the final
Aggregate Purchase Price and each of the components thereof (including the
PlasChem Net Indebtedness) and attach reasonable documentation supporting
Parent's calculations. In the event Parent does not deliver the Adjustment
Schedule within the seventy-five (75) day period specified in the immediately
preceding sentence, at Seller Representative's election, either (i) the
Closing Aggregate Purchase Price shall become final and binding upon the
parties hereto or (ii) Parent shall continue to be obligated to deliver the
Adjustment Schedule. Parent shall afford, and cause the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries to afford, Seller Representative and its Representatives
reasonable access to the work papers and other books and records (including
Tax records) of Parent, the Surviving Blocker, the Surviving Company and their
respective Subsidiaries for purposes of assisting Seller Representative and
its Representatives in their review of the Adjustment Schedule. The Adjustment
Schedule and the resulting calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall
become final and binding upon the parties hereto thirty (30) days following
Seller Representative's receipt of the Adjustment Schedule unless Seller
Representative provides written notice of its objection (an " _Objection
Statement_ ") to Parent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period. Any Objection Statement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature
and amount of any disagreement so asserted, a reasonably detailed explanation
of the basis thereof, and attach documentation supporting Seller
Representative's calculations. If Seller Representative shall have timely
delivered an Objection Statement to Parent, Parent and Seller Representative
may negotiate to resolve any objections set forth therein for a period of no
more than thirty (30) days, and, if Parent and Seller Representative resolve
each of Seller Representative's objections as set forth on the Objection
Statement, the Adjustment Schedule, as revised pursuant to such negotiations,
shall become final and binding upon the parties hereto. If, following such
thirty (30) day period, any of the objections set forth on the Objection
Statement shall remain outstanding, Parent or Seller Representative may
refer such disputed items for resolution by an internationally recognized
independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to Parent and Seller
Representative; _provided_ that in the event that Parent and Seller
Representative fail to agree thereon, the accounting firm shall be Ernst and
Young LLP (such firm, the " _Independent Accountant_ "); _provided_ that if
Ernst and Young LLP is unwilling or unable to serve as the Independent
Accountant and Seller Representative and Parent are unable to select an
alternative firm within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Objection
Statement, either Parent or Seller Representative may request the American
Arbitration Association appoint, within twenty (20) days from the date of such
request, an internationally recognized independent accounting firm. Each of
Parent and Seller Representative shall promptly provide their assertions
regarding the Aggregate Purchase Price in writing to the Independent
Accountant and to each other. The Independent Accountant shall be
instructed to render its determination with respect to such disagreements as
soon as reasonably practicable (which shall be no later than forty-five (45)
days following the date on which the remaining objections are referred to the
Independent Accountant). The Independent Accountant shall act as an expert
and not an arbitrator and shall base its determination solely upon the written
submissions of Parent and Seller Representative, any oral advocacy by each of
Parent and Seller Representative in front of the Independent Accountant and
the applicable provisions of this Agreement (and shall not conduct an
independent investigation). Without limiting the foregoing, the Independent
Accountant will resolve the dispute with respect to each disputed component of
the Aggregate Purchase Price by assigning a value, as determined by the
Independent Accountant, to each component thereof, that is no higher than the
highest amount, or lowest than the lowest amount, claimed with respect to
such item in Seller Representative's final calculation thereof (as modified
following discussions with Parent and as submitted to the Independent
Accountant at the outset of the dispute resolution process with a copy to
Parent) or Parent's final calculation thereof (as modified following
discussions with Seller Representative and as submitted to the Independent
Accountant at the outset of the dispute resolution process with a copy to
Seller Representative), as applicable. The determination of the Independent
Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto,
and no such Person shall seek further recourse from any other Person or
Governmental Entity other than to enforce the determination of the
Independent Accountant. All fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accountant
hereunder shall be borne by the Selling Equityholders on the one hand, and
Parent on the other hand, based on the percentage that the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party and such allocation of fees and expenses shall be
calculated by the Independent Accountant and shall be final and binding on
the parties. As used herein, the " _Final Aggregate Purchase Price_ " means
the amount of the Aggregate Purchase Price, as finally determined by this
_Section 2.6(a)_.

  



    

10

 



    



  

(b) If the Final Aggregate Purchase Price is less than the Closing
Aggregate Purchase Price (the absolute amount of such shortfall the "
_Shortfall_ "), then the Selling Equityholders shall surrender, for no
consideration:

  



  

(i) first, if any, the right to receive any deferred payment in
accordance with _Section 2.9_ with respect to an amount of Excess Shares with
a value equal to the Shortfall; and

  



  

(ii) second, if the value of any right surrendered in _clause (i)_ is
less than the Shortfall, an amount of Parent Common Stock held by the Selling
Equityholders with a value equal to the Shortfall (less the value of any right
to deferred payment surrendered in accordance with _clause (i)_ ),

  



  

in each case by no later than five (5) Business Days following such final
determination. For purposes of the calculation of value required by this
_Section 2.6(b)_ , each share of Parent Common Stock and the deferred payment
right with respect to each Excess Share will be deemed to have a value of
$10.00, notwithstanding the then trading price of Parent Common Stock.

  



    

11

 



    



  

(c) If the Final Aggregate Purchase Price is greater than the
Closing Aggregate Purchase Price (the absolute amount of such excess, the "
_Excess Amount_ "), then Parent shall issue to the Selling Equityholders such
aggregate amount of Parent Common Stock equal in value to the aggregate of
the Excess Amount by no later than five (5) Business Days following such final
determination, subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_. For
purposes of the calculation of value required by this _Section 2.6(c)_ , each
share of Parent Common Stock will be deemed to have a value of $10.00
notwithstanding the then trading price of the stock. Such Parent Common Stock
shall be allocated amongst the Selling Equityholders in the same proportion as
such shares of Parent Common Stock that would have been allocated among the
Selling Equityholders had the Final Aggregate Purchase Price
been determinable at the Closing, and Seller Representative shall provide
Parent with written instructions with respect thereto upon determination of
the Excess Amount.

  



  

2.7 _Closing Deliverables_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent:

  



  

(i) the Payoff Documents;

property holding corporation and (ii) with respect to the Company, a
Partnership in which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets
consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the
value of the gross assets consists of U.S. real property interests _plus_ any
cash or cash equivalents, each together with a duly executed notice of such
certification to be mailed to the Internal Revenue Service by Parent
following the Closing.

  



  

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the Company:

  



  

(i) a duly executed counterpart of each Ancillary Agreement to be
executed at the Closing;

  



  

(ii) evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the Warrant
Exchange has been completed or will be completed substantially
contemporaneously with the Closing;

  



    

12

 



    



  

(iii) a resignation letter for each director of Parent other than any
director of Parent designated to continue serving on the Board of Directors
pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement; and

  



  

(iv) evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the
agreements to be terminated pursuant to _Section 5.13_ have been duly
terminated with no liability (of any nature) to Parent.

  



  

2.8 _Selling Equityholders Election Notice_.

  



  

(a) If, upon the satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with this
Agreement) of the last to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
other than (i) any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing Date, but are expected to be so satisfied and (ii) the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(f)_ and _Section 6.3(j)_ , which Parent
believes in good faith will not be satisfied on the day on which the Closing
would otherwise occur in accordance with this Agreement, then Parent shall
provide the Company written notice thereof, specifying Parent's good faith
estimate of the amount of Net Parent Stockholder Redemptions as of the day on
which the Closing would otherwise occur in accordance with this Agreement,
together with reasonable supporting documentation with respect thereto (an "
_Over-Redemption Notice_ ").

  



  

(b) Following the Company's receipt of the Over-Redemption Notice,
and until 5:00 p.m. Houston, Texas, time on the fifth (5th) Business Day
following the date of receipt of the Over-Redemption Notice, the Company may
deliver a notice to Parent (an " _Election Notice_ "), on behalf of any of
the Selling Equityholders, that such Selling Equityholders have determined to
elect to receive an additional portion, in excess of the amount to which such
Selling Equityholders would have otherwise been entitled to pursuant to this
_Article II_ , of the Merger Consideration in Parent Common Stock (subject to
adjustment in accordance with  _Section 2.3(b)_ ) in lieu of the Cash
Consideration.

  



  

(c) Each Election Notice shall specify the election of such Selling
Equityholders to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration in
Parent Common Stock (subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section
2.3(b)_ ) in lieu of the Cash Consideration and the aggregate amount of the
Cash Consideration to be retained by Parent in connection therewith. Any
election pursuant to an Election Notice shall be final and binding on Parent
and (i) each Selling Equityholder that shall have caused the Company to
deliver such an Election Notice to Parent and (ii) each such Selling
Equityholder shall only be entitled to receive such amount of the Cash
Consideration and Parent Common Stock (subject to adjustment in accordance
with _Section 2.3(b)_ ) as set forth in such Election Notice (and subject to
any adjustments to the aggregate Merger Consideration); _provided_ , _however_
, if the Closing does not occur within five (5) Business Days after the
delivery of an Election Notice, other than as a result of a breach by the
Company of this Agreement, the Company may, in its discretion, revoke such
Election Notice, in which case it shall be null and void.

  



  

2.9 _Deferred Payment of Future Proceeds_.

  



  

(a) _General_. To the extent there is a downward adjustment in the
Stock Consideration by a number of Excess Shares in accordance with
_Section 2.3(b)_ , Parent shall be obligated to make future payments to the
Selling Equityholders, in such proportions as provided on the Consideration
Schedule and in accordance with instructions of Seller Representative as set
forth in this _Section 2.9_  with respect to such Excess Shares.

  



    

13

 



    



  

(b) _Participation in Future Side-by-Side Offerings_.

  



  

(i) If at any time and from time to time (A) any Sponsor (as such
term is defined in the Stockholders Agreement) issues a Shelf
Takedown Request (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) to effect an
offering of such Sponsor's Registrable Securities (as defined in the
Stockholders Agreement) pursuant to such Sponsor's rights under the
Stockholders Agreement or (B) Parent at any time proposes to conduct an
Issuer Public Sale (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) and any Sponsor
elects to participate in such Issuer Public Sale by delivering a Piggyback
Request (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) in accordance with the
terms of the Stockholder Agreement, then Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to include in such Issuer Public Sale, a number of newly issued
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of Excess Shares that have
not yet been issued by Parent in accordance with this _Section 2.9_ , which
shall be issued on a side-by-side basis with all other equity securities
included in the proposed Issuer Public Sale in accordance with the provisions
of the Stockholders Agreement, and subject to any applicable restrictions and
cutbacks applicable to the Sponsors (any such Issuer Public Sale, a " _Side-
by-Side Offering_ "), and remit the gross proceeds thereof (less any
underwriting discounts and commissions) relating to the Excess Shares actually
sold by Parent (the " _Parent Primary Excess Shares_ ") in the Side-by-Side
Offering (the " _Side-by-Side Offering Proceeds_ ") to the Selling
Equityholders. Payment of any Side-by-Side Offering Proceeds shall be made by
Parent to the Selling Equityholders promptly, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days, of receipt thereof by Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in accordance with instructions provided in writing by Seller
Representative at least one Business Day prior to the date on which payment
would be due.

  



  

(ii) Parent shall comply with the procedures set forth in Article IV
of the Stockholders Agreement with respect to the execution of any Side by
Side Offering required by this _Section 2.9(b)_ , including with respect to
registration of the Excess Shares, notice, cooperation, priority, payment of
fees and expenses and other matters.

  



  

(iii) Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in _Section 2.9(c)_ ,
upon the payment to the Selling Equityholders of the Side-by-Side
Offering Proceeds with respect to any Parent Primary Excess Shares, Parent's
obligations to make payments to the Selling Equityholders with respect to an
equivalent amount of Excess Shares shall cease and will be deemed fully
satisfied, regardless of the price at which such Parent Primary Excess Shares
are issued in the Side-by-Side Offering, so long as (i) Parent complies with
its obligations in _Section 2.9(b)(ii)_ and (ii) the price at which Parent
offers the Parent Primary Excess Shares in the Side-by-Side Offering is the
same price at which the Sponsor initiating or participating in such Side-by-
Side Offering offers its shares of Parent Common Stock in the Side-by-Side
Offering. In the event that Parent is unable to issue in the Side-by-Side
Offering the full amount of Excess Shares remaining at the time of Side-by-
Side Offering, as determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion, then the
number of Excess Shares shall be automatically reduced by the number of
Parent Primary Excess Shares issued in the Side-by-Side Offering, and
Parent's payment obligations with respect to any remaining Excess Shares,
including the obligation to participate in future Side-by-Side Offerings in
accordance with this _Section 2.9(b)_ , shall continue hereunder.

  



    

14

 



    



  

(c) _Early Trigger Offerings_. In addition to the obligations set
forth in _Section 2.9(b)_, upon the first Business Day (the " _Early Trigger
Date_ ") on which the volume-weighted average trading price of the Parent
Common Stock for any period of twenty (20) trading days in any thirty (30)
day period exceeds $15.00 per share, subject to adjustment in accordance with
_Section 2.9(e)_ (the " _Early Payment Target Price_ "), Parent shall, either:

  



  

(i) within five (5) Business Days of the Early Trigger Date, pay to
the Selling Equityholders an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
Early Payment Target Price, _multiplied_ by (B) the number of Excess Shares
(the " _Fixed Payment Amount_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with instructions provided by Seller Representative at
least one Business Day prior to the date on which such payment would be due,
and upon payment thereof, Parent's obligations with respect to the Excess
Shares shall cease and Parent shall have no further obligation to make any
payments in accordance with this _Section 2.9_ ; or

  



  

(ii) use reasonable best efforts to promptly sell to third parties in
a primary underwritten offering (an " _Early Trigger Offering_ ") a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of any remaining
Excess Shares, and remit the gross proceeds thereof (less any underwriting
discounts and commissions) relating to the issued Excess Shares to the Selling
Equityholders (the " _Early Trigger Offering Proceeds_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that without the written consent of Seller Representative, on
behalf of the Selling Equityholders, Parent shall not issue shares in any
Early Trigger Offering at a gross price per share less than the Early Payment
Target Price. Payment of any Early Trigger Offering Proceeds shall be made by
Parent to the Selling Equityholders promptly, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days of receipt thereof by Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, in accordance with instructions provided in writing by Seller
Representative at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which
payment would be due.

  



  

Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, whether to take the actions set
forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence; provided, 
_however_ , that if Parent elects to take the actions set forth in clause
(ii), Parent shall comply with the procedures set forth in Article IV of the
Stockholders Agreement with respect to the execution of any Early Trigger
Offering undertaken in accordance this _Section 2.9(c)_ , including with
respect to registration of the Excess Shares, notice, cooperation, priority of
securities sold in connection with any Early Trigger Offering, payments of
fees and expenses, in each case as set forth therein. In the event that
Parent is unable to issue in the Early Trigger Offering the full amount of
Excess Shares remaining at the time of the Early Trigger Offering, as
determined in Parent's reasonable discretion, then the number of Excess Shares
shall be automatically reduced by the number of issued Excess Shares in the
Early Trigger Offering, and Parent's payment obligations with respect to any
remaining Excess Shares, including the obligation to participate in future
Early Trigger Offerings in accordance with this  _Section 2.9(c)_ , shall
continue hereunder.

  



  

(d) _Outside Date_. If, on June 30, 2021 (the " _Outside Date_ "),
the number of Excess Shares is greater than zero, then Parent shall, either:

  



    

15

 



    



  

(i) within five (5) Business Days of the Outside Date, pay to the
Selling Equityholders an amount in cash equal to the product of (A)
the number of Excess Shares, _multiplied_ by (B) the volume weighted-average
trading price for the 20 trading day period immediately preceding the Outside
Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with
instructions provided by Seller Representative at least one Business Day
prior to the date on which payment would be due, and upon payment thereof,
Parent shall have no further obligation to make any payments in accordance
with this _Section 2.9_ ; or

  



  

(ii) use reasonable best efforts to promptly sell to third parties in
a primary offering (an " _Outside Date Offering_ ") a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of Excess Shares, and remit
the gross proceeds thereof (less any underwriting discounts and commissions)
relating to the Excess Shares actually issued in such Outside Date Offering to
the Selling Equityholders (the " _Outside Date Offering Proceeds_ "). Payment
of any Outside Date Offering Proceeds shall be made by Parent to the Selling
Equityholders promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days of
receipt thereof by Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
in accordance with instructions provided in writing by Seller
Representative at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which
payment would be due.

  



  

Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, whether to take the actions set
forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence; provided, 
_however_ , that if Parent elects to take the actions set forth in clause
(ii), Parent shall comply with the procedures set forth in Article IV of the
Stockholders Agreement with respect to the execution of any Outside Date
Offering undertaken in accordance this _Section 2.9(d)_ , including with
respect to registration of the Excess Shares, notice, cooperation, priority,
payments of fees and expenses, in each case as set forth therein. In the
event that Parent is unable to issue in the initial Outside Date Offering the
full amount of Excess Shares remaining at the time of the initial Outside Date
Offering, as determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion, then the
number of Excess Shares shall be automatically reduced by the number of Excess
Shares issued in such Outside Date Offering, and Parent's obligations with
respect to any remaining Excess Shares, including the obligation to continue
to complete any necessary additional Outside Date Offerings in accordance with
this _Section 2.9(d)_ , shall continue hereunder.

  



  

(e) _Adjustments on Certain Events_. In the event Parent shall at
any time after the date hereof declare or pay any dividend on Parent
Common Stock payable in shares of Parent Common Stock, or effect subdivision
or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, then in each such case, the number of Excess
Shares and the Early Payment Target Price shall be adjusted by multiplying
such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (together with any other shares so
reclassified) outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of
which is the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to such event.

  



  

(f) _Reservation of Parent Common Stock_. Parent shall at all times
reserve and keep available for issuance such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to permit the issuance
of all Excess Shares and shall take all action required to increase the
authorized number of shares of Parent Common Stock if at any time there shall
be insufficient unissued shares of Parent Common Stock to permit such
reservation.

  



    

16

 



    



  

(g) _Consolidation, Merger, Etc_. In the event Parent shall enter
into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which
the shares of Parent Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other
stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case,
the Selling Equityholders shall be entitled, at the same time, to receive a
cash payment equal in value to the product of (i) the remaining number of
Excess Shares, _multiplied_ by (ii) the aggregate amount of stock, securities,
cash and/or any other property, as the case may be, into which or for which
each share of Parent Common Stock is changed or exchanged.

  



  

(h) _Adverse Action_. Prior to the payment in full of all amounts
in respect of the Excess Shares as provided in this _Section 2.9_ , except as
expressly contemplated herein or in the Stockholders Agreement, Parent shall
take no action (whether through reorganization, consolidation, merger,
dissolution or otherwise), a primary purpose of which is to hinder, avoid,
seek to avoid or prevent the issuance of, or payment with respect to, the
Excess Shares.

reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impair, the ability
of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall any of the following

condition, change, event or effect resulting from or relating to changes in
general economic, regulatory or political conditions or conditions in the
United States or worldwide capital markets; (B) any occurrence, condition,
change, event or effect that affects the industries in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries operate generally (including changes in commodity prices,

does not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a disproportionate
impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to
other industry participants; (C) any occurrence, condition, change, event or
effect resulting from or relating to fluctuations in the value of currencies;

be applicable with respect to the Company's representations and warranties in
_Section 3.1(c)(ii)_ and to the extent related thereto, the condition in
_Section 6.2(a)_ ); (F) any change in the trading prices or trading volume of
the Company's debt instruments or the credit ratings assigned thereto
(but not any change or effect underlying such change in prices, volume or
credit rating to the extent such change or effect would otherwise constitute
a Company Material Adverse Effect); (G) any change in accounting requirements
or principles imposed upon the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or any change in law, or the interpretation thereof; (H) any
occurrence, condition, change, event or effect resulting from actions taken
by Parent or any Affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act, an " _Affiliate_ ") of Parent; and (I) compliance by the
Company with the terms of this Agreement or any written request of Parent;
and (ii) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any party, any corporation
or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which: (1)
such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner; or (2)
at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Board of Directors or others

(i) Each of the Company and New Holdco has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party by each of the

all necessary limited liability company action on the part of the Company,
including the written consent of TPG Accolade, L.P., a Delaware limited

executed and delivered by the Company and New Holdco and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the other parties
hereto, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of the Company and

any material post-termination or post-employment medical, health, life
insurance or other welfare benefits to any employees, former employees,
directors, service providers or any other Person, other than in accordance
with Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code or

with respect to current or former service providers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries located outside the United States is a defined benefit-type
plan or, if maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and is not

Company and its Subsidiaries, and such Real Property, including all buildings,
structures, improvements, fixtures, building systems and equipment, and all
components thereof that are located on the Owned Real Property (the "
_Improvements_ ") are in good condition and repair (subject to ordinary wear
and tear, casualty and condemnation). Except as would not reasonably be

partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, has all requisite partnership power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and in good standing to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or
the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
so to qualify or be in good standing would not be reasonably likely to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay or impair the
ability of Blocker to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Blocker has heretofore made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of its certificate of formation (the " _Blocker Certificate of
Formation_ "), and its Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership, dated as of July 19, 2012 (the " _Blocker Partnership Agreement_
"), and each such document is (x) in full force and effect and (y) other than

material respect from the copy made available to Parent.

  



  

(b) _Capital Structure_. As of the date hereof, the outstanding
equity interests of Blocker consist of a non-economic general partner
interest and a 100% limited partner interest, and no Voting Debt of Blocker

as of the close of business on the date hereof (collectively, " _Blocker

Partnership Interests, there are no options, warrants or other rights to
subscribe for, purchase or acquire from Blocker any equity interests in
Blocker or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
Blocker Partnership Interests. After giving effect to the Pre-
Closing Transactions, each of the Company Series A Units owned beneficially
and of record by Blocker (the " _Blocker Owned Company Units_ ") will be
owned free and clear of all Encumbrances. There are not any stockholder
agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which

contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
partnership action on the part of Blocker. This Agreement and, when executed,
each Ancillary Agreement, has been, or shall have been, as applicable, duly
executed and delivered by Blocker, assuming this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding obligation of the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of Blocker enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

  



  

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or acceleration of any material obligation or the loss of a material
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the
properties or assets of Blocker under, any provision of (A) the Blocker
Certificate of Formation or the Blocker Partnership Agreement, (B) any loan or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, deed of trust, indenture, lease or
other agreement, permit, franchise or license to which Blocker is a party or
by which any of its properties or assets are bound, or (C) assuming the
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, filings or
permits referred to in _Section 3.2(c)(iii)_ are duly and timely obtained or
made, any judgment, permit, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Blocker or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in
the case of clauses (B) and (C), any such violations, defaults, acceleration,

or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay or impair the ability of
Blocker to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from, any Governmental
Entity, is required to be obtained or made by Blocker in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Blocker or the consummation by
Blocker of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for: (A) the filing of
a premerger notification report by the Company under the HSR Act and any
other applicable Premerger Notification Rules, and the expiration or

of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; (C) such filings and

connection with any of the foregoing) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ "). In
the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging the Mergers
as violative of any Premerger Notification Rule or other Antitrust Law, Parent
shall take such action, including any Divestiture Action, as may be necessary
to avoid, resist or resolve such action. Parent shall be entitled to direct
any proceedings or negotiations with any Antitrust Authority or other Person
relating to any of the foregoing. Unless expressly prohibited by

event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered
or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall take promptly any and all steps
necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to
permit such consummation prior to the Termination Date.

of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of Blocker, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Employee
Benefit Plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving

Persons may retain Blocker's or the Company's, as applicable, regularly

Company and the Surviving Blocker any undertaking required by applicable law,
but, subject to applicable law, without any requirement for the posting of a
bond or any other terms or conditions other than those expressly set forth

Merger Effective Time were directors or officers of Blocker, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries except to the extent required by law.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Blocker and Surviving Company
to, fulfill and honor any indemnification agreements between the Company or

5.9 _Investigation; No Other Representations or Warranties_. Each
of the Company, Blocker, Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own inquiry and investigation
into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment concerning, with
respect to Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub, Blocker, the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and with respect to the Company and Blocker,
Parent, Blocker, Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub, and in each case their
businesses and operations, and each such Person has requested such documents
and information from each of the other applicable Persons as each such
Person considers material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Each such
Person acknowledges and agrees that it has had an opportunity to ask all
questions of such other Persons with respect to any matter such party
considers material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In connection
with such investigation, Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub,
and their respective representatives have received from Blocker or the
Company or their respective representatives certain other
estimates, projections and other forecasts for Blocker, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and certain estimates, plans and budget information. Each of
Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub, on behalf of itself,
acknowledges and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets; that
Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub are familiar with such
uncertainties; that Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub are
taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy
and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so
furnished to them or their Affiliates or representatives; and that Parent,
Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub will not (and will cause all of
their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates or any other Person acting
on their behalf to not) assert any claim or cause of action against Blocker,
the Company or any of their respective direct or indirect partners, directors,
officers, employees, agents, stockholders, Affiliates, consultants, counsel,
accountants, investment bankers or representatives with respect thereto, or
hold any such Person liable with respect thereto other than in connection with
a breach of any of the representations and warranties made by the Company
that are expressly set forth in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.3_ of this
Agreement, or the representations and warranties made by Blocker that are
expressly set forth in _Section 3.2_ of this Agreement. Each of the parties
agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made by the
Company that are expressly set forth in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.3_ of
this Agreement, the representations and warranties made by Blocker that are
expressly set forth in _Section 3.2_ of this Agreement and the
representations and warranties of Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company
Merger that are expressly set forth in _Section 3.4_ of this Agreement, and
any representations and warranties of such Person expressly set forth in any
Ancillary Agreement, no party to this Agreement has made and shall not be
deemed to have made any representation or warranty of any kind with respect
to the matters contemplated by this Agreement or any materials heretofore or
hereafter delivered to or made available to each of the other applicable
Persons or their respective representatives or Affiliates. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and
Company Merger Sub agrees that neither Blocker, the Company, any Selling
Equityholder nor any of their respective Affiliates or representatives, makes
or has made any representation or warranty to Parent, Blocker Merger Sub or
Company Merger Sub or any of their representatives or Affiliates with respect
to:

  



  

(i) any projections, forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets

thereof) or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or
affairs of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent, Company Merger Sub or Blocker Merger
Sub or their respective representatives or Affiliates; or

  



    

68

 



    



  

(ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or
hereafter delivered to or made available to Parent, Company Merger Sub or
Blocker Merger Sub or their respective representatives or Affiliates, except
to the extent and as expressly covered by a representation and warranty made
by the Company and contained in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.3_ of this
Agreement or by Blocker and contained in _Section 3.2_ of this Agreement.

  



  

Nothing in this Agreement (including this  _Section 5.9_ ) shall relieve any
party hereto of any liability for or limit any Person's ability to seek any
remedy in the event of fraud. For purposes of this Agreement, " _fraud_ "
means intentional fraud involving a knowing and intentional misrepresentation
of a fact or concealment of a fact made or concealed with the intent of
inducing any other party hereto to enter into this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements and upon which such other party has reasonably relied (and
does not include any fraud claim based on constructive knowledge, negligent
misrepresentation, recklessness or a similar theory).

  



  

5.10 _Debt Financing; Equity Financing; Cooperation_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms (or on
terms no less favorable to each of Parent, Blocker Merger Sub, Company Merger
Sub and the Company and its Subsidiaries) and conditions (including the flex
provisions) described in the Debt Commitment Letter and shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under,
the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver, (i)
with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter, reduces the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing to be funded on the Closing Date, or (ii) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any
other provision of the Debt Commitment Letter, in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay or prevent or materially impair
the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the Closing Date or (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent,
Blocker Merger Sub or Company Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights
against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto or (iii) is otherwise adverse in any material
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that, subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this _Section 5.10(a)_,
Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub may amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to add additional arrangers, bookrunners and
agents). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any material
amendment, modification or replacement. For purposes of this Agreement,
references to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter as permitted or required, as the case may be, to be
amended, modified or replaced by this _Section 5.10(a)_ and references to
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted, or
required, as the case may be, to be amended, modified or replaced by this
_Section 5.10(a)_.

  



    

69

 



    



  

(b) Each of Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (or on terms not materially less favorable to Parent, Blocker Merger
Sub, Company Merger Sub and the Company and its Subsidiaries than the terms
and conditions (including flex provisions) in the Debt Commitment Letter) and
(iii) to satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing Period) all conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter
and such definitive agreements thereto (other than any condition where the
failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the Company's failure to
furnish information described in _Section 5.10(d)_) and to consummate the
Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable best
efforts to cause the lenders committing to fund the Debt Financing to fund
such Debt Financing at Closing and (iv) to enforce its rights under the
Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall allow Company to participate in the
negotiation of the Debt Financing and shall use reasonable best efforts to
keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide
to the Company copies of the material definitive agreements for the Debt
Financing and such other information and documentation available to them as
shall be reasonably requested by the Company for purposes of monitoring the
progress of the financing activities and assisting in the negotiation thereof.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Blocker Merger Sub
and Company Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (x) of any breach
or default of any material provisions by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letter or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing of which Parent,
Blocker Merger Sub or Company Merger Sub become aware, (y) of the receipt of
(A) any written notice or (B) other written communication, in each case from
any Financing Source with respect to any actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing of any provisions of the
Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing
and (z) if at any time for any reason Parent, Blocker Merger Sub or Company
Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner
or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in any event within two (2) Business Days of the date the
Company delivers to Parent a written request, Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and
Company Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of
the immediately preceding sentence;  _provided_ , _however_ , subject to the
rules of discovery otherwise applicable, that they need not provide any
information that is privileged or that is requested for purposes of
litigation. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby with terms and conditions (including market
flex provisions) not materially less favorable to Parent, Blocker Merger Sub,
Company Merger Sub and the Company (or their respective Affiliates) than the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
the availability of which shall not be subject to material additional or
expanded conditions as compared to those set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such
event. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all
Contracts or other arrangements (including fee letters) pursuant to which any
such alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the
Debt Financing. Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Debt Financing, or any
alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing. For purposes of this
Agreement, references to "Debt Financing" shall include the alternate
financing as permitted by this _Section 5.10_ and "Debt Commitment Letters"
shall include such documents related to the alternative financing as
permitted by this _Section 5.10_.

Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the equity financing substantially, in all
material respects, on the terms and conditions set forth on _Schedule
5.10(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (or on terms no less favorable to
each of Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub) (such financing,
on such terms ultimately obtained in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Equity Financing_ "). Each of Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Merger Sub
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Equity Financing substantially, in
all material respects, on the terms and conditions set forth on _Schedule
5.10(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (such definitive agreements, the "
_Equity Financing Documents_ "), (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to consummation of the Equity Financing set forth in the Equity
Financing Documents (other than any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a direct result of the Company's failure to furnish
information described in _Section 5.10(d)_ ), to consummate the Equity
Financing at or prior to the Closing and to comply with its obligations under
any Equity Financing Documents. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Equity Financing
and provide to the Company copies of the Equity Financing Documents and such
other information and documentation available to them as shall be
reasonably requested by the Company for purposes of monitoring the progress
of the financing activities. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub shall give the
Company prompt notice (x) of any breach or default of any material provisions
by any party to any Equity Financing Documents of which Parent, Blocker Merger
Sub or Company Merger Sub become aware, (y) of the receipt of (A) any written
notice or (B) other written communication, in each case from any party to any
Equity Financing Documents with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Equity Financing
Documents of any provisions of the Equity Financing Documents or (2) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Equity Financing
Documents or definitive agreements related to the Equity Financing with
respect to the obligation to fund the Equity Financing or the amount of the
Equity Financing to be funded at Closing and (z) if at any time for any
reason Parent, Blocker Merger Sub or Company Merger Sub believes in good faith
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Equity Financing
on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by
_Schedule 5.10(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or any Equity Financing
Documents. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two (2)
Business Days of the date the Company delivers to Parent a written request,
Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clauses (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence;
_provided_ , _however_ , subject to the rules of discovery
otherwise applicable, that they need not provide any information that is
privileged or that is requested for purposes of litigation. If any portion of
the Equity Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, Parent, Blocker Merger Sub
and Company Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources
with terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent, Company
Merger Sub and Blocker Merger Sub (or their respective Affiliates) than the
terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Documents. Parent,
Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the
obtaining of the Equity Financing is not a condition to Closing. For purposes
of this Agreement, references to "Equity Financing" shall include the
alternate financing as permitted by this _Section 5.10(c)_ and
"Equity Financing Documents" shall include such documents related to the
alternative financing as permitted by this _Section 5.10(c)_.

use its reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and
Company Merger Sub, and shall cause each of the Company's Subsidiaries to use
its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its representatives, including legal and accounting
representatives, to provide, in each case at Parent's sole expense (with
respect to out-of-pocket expenses), all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent that is customary in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing and the Equity Financing (the " _Financing_ ") ( _provided_ that
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Blocker, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries), which
reasonable best efforts shall include (i) furnishing Parent, Blocker Merger
Sub and Company Merger Sub and their Financing Sources, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following Parent's request, with information regarding

hereof)), (viii) assisting in (A) the preparation and execution of one or
more credit agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements or (B) the

or the Company to the extent they resulted from (x) information provided by
Blocker or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries containing any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (y) the willful

5.14 _Repayment of Debt_

  



  

(a) If, prior to the Closing Date, Parent decides to commence a
tender offer and/or consent solicitation in respect of some or all of
the outstanding Company Notes (each, a " _Debt Offer_ "), Parent shall
prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with such
Debt Offers, including the offers to purchase and consent solicitation
statements, letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively,
the " _Debt Offer Documents_ "). The Company agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective representatives, including legal and accounting
representatives, to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the
preparation of the Debt Offer Documents and the consummation of such Debt
Offers, including with respect to the Company's execution of supplemental
indentures (either at the Company Merger Effective Time or, if earlier,
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Company Merger Effective Time)
reflecting amendments to the indentures applicable to the Company Notes
subject to any Debt Offer, to the extent approved by any required consents of
holders of such Company Notes. All mailings to the holders of the Company
Notes in connection with the Debt Offers shall be subject to the prior review
and comment by the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to
each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of any Debt Offer any
information in the applicable Debt Offer Documents should be discovered by
the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Debt Offer Documents, so that such Debt Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be disseminated by Parent to the holders of
the applicable Company Notes. To the extent that the provisions of any
applicable law conflict with this _Section 5.14(a)_ , Parent and the Company
shall comply with the applicable law and shall not be deemed to have breached
its obligations hereunder by such compliance. Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and
Company Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the pendency nor the
consummation of any such Debt Offer is a condition to Closing.

  



  

(b) If requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall, to the
extent permitted by the Indenture, take any and all actions
reasonably requested by Parent (including, without limitation, the issuance
of one or more notices of redemption unless objected to by the Trustee or The
Depository Trust Company) to facilitate the redemption, satisfaction and/or
discharge of Company Notes pursuant to the Indenture at or following the
Company Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to, or
substantially contemporaneously with, either (a) the Company being required
to issue any unconditional irrevocable notice of redemption or (b) the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to any conditional notice of
redemption, Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with the
Trustee sufficient funds to effect such redemption, satisfaction and
discharge. Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that neither the pendency nor the consummation of any such redemption,
satisfaction and discharge is a condition to Closing.

  



    

74

 



    



  

(c) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse
Blocker and the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Blocker, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
cooperation of Blocker, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries
contemplated by _Section 5.14(b)_ and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Blocker, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Selling Equityholders and their
respective representatives and Affiliates from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, out-of-pocket costs or out-of-pocket expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any Debt Offer and/or
redemption, satisfaction and discharge and any information used in connection
therewith, except for liabilities of Blocker or the Company to the extent they
resulted from (x) information provided by Blocker or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries containing any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the

 INDEMNIFICATION

parties agree that the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections
3.2(d)_,  _3.2(e)_ and _3.3_ shall survive the Closing until the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the " _Survival Period_ ").

  



  

7.2 _Indemnification of Parent._ Subject to the limitations on
recourse and recovery set forth in this _Article VII_ , Seller
Representative shall cause the Selling Equityholders to indemnify, and the
Selling Equityholders shall agree to indemnify pursuant to the
acknowledgment delivered to Parent in accordance with _Section
2.4(a)(vii)_, defend and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving Blocker and the
Surviving Company and their respective employees, directors and officers (in
each case, solely in their capacity as such) (each such Person, excluding any
Selling Equityholders, a " _Parent Indemnified Party_ "), from and against
any and all Losses of any Parent Indemnified Party after the Closing, arising
out of any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Sections 3.2(d)_, _3.2(e)_ and _3.3_  (any of such Losses, a "
_Parent Indemnification Claim_ "); _provided_ that any references to
"material," "Material Adverse Effect" or words of similar import in any such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded for purposes of determining
whether any such breach or inaccuracy thereof has occurred and the ultimate
amount of any Losses subject to indemnification hereunder. To the extent any
Losses are subject to indemnification hereunder, Seller Representative shall
cause the Selling Equityholders to promptly surrender to Parent a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, valued at a per share price of $10.00
(irrespective of the then market value of the Parent Common Stock), equal to
the value of such Losses. Prior to the expiration of the Survival Period,
Seller Representative shall cause the Selling Equityholders to retain and not
transfer to any Person, other than to a Parent Indemnified Party in
accordance with this _Article VII_ , 3,500,000 shares of Parent Common Stock
(such shares, together, the " _Reserved Shares_ "), which shall be the sole
source of payment to any Parent Indemnified Party to recover any Losses
pursuant to this _Article VII_. The Reserved Shares shall be imprinted with a
legend sufficient to identify the restriction on transfer thereof set forth
in this _Section 7.2_. Upon termination of the Survival Period, the
Selling Equityholders shall be permitted to freely transfer any Reserved
Shares other than, to the extent applicable, a number of Reserved Shares
equal in value to the amount of Losses asserted with respect to any Parent
Indemnification Claim in accordance with this Agreement asserted prior to the
termination of the Survival Period and still pending upon the termination of
the Survival Period (a " _Pending Claim_ "). Upon the resolution of all of
such Pending Claims, subject to the termination of the Survival Period, any
Reserved Shares not required to be transferred to a Parent Indemnified Party
as payment with respect to such Pending Claim shall cease to be subject to
the restrictions of this _Section 7.2_ and shall be freely transferrable by
the Selling Equityholders and no longer available as a source of payment for
any Parent Indemnification Claim hereunder.

  



    

79

 



    



  

7.3 _Limitations. _

  



  

(a) _Minimum Claim_. If any Parent Indemnification Claim relating
to any single event or series of related events that is indemnifiable under 
_Section 7.2_ results in aggregate Losses to Parent that do not exceed
$100,000, such Losses shall not be deemed to be Losses under this Agreement
and shall not be eligible for indemnification under this _Article VII_.

  



  

(b) _Deductible_. Other than with respect to Losses resulting from
a breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 3.2(d)_, _ 3.2(e)_ , _3.3(a)_ , _3.3(b)_ , _3.3(c)_ and _3.3(s)_ ,
the Selling Equityholders shall not be liable hereunder with respect to any
Parent Indemnification Claim, unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Parent Indemnification Claims exceeds $500,000, in which case the Selling
Equityholders shall be liable for the amount of all Losses subject to
indemnification hereunder only in excess of such amount.

  



  

(c) _Limitations as to Time_. No Parent Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to make any claim with respect to a breach of any
representation that survives the Closing pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , unless
(i) such Parent Indemnified Party has provided proper written notice with
respect to such Parent Indemnification Claim, specifying in reasonable detail,
the basis of the claim, to Seller Representative prior to the expiration of
the Survival Period and (ii) such claim is made in respect of Losses (A)
specified in reasonable detail and incurred prior to the expiration of the
Survival Period or (B) reasonably estimated and reasonably expected to arise
in connection with such Parent Indemnification Claim.

  



  

(d) _Maximum Liability_. The Selling Equityholders shall not have
any liability with respect to Losses that are indemnifiable in
accordance with _Section 7.2_ in excess of $35,000,000 in the aggregate. The
Reserved Shares shall be the sole source of payment to any Parent Indemnified
Party to recover any Losses indemnifiable in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence. Other than a Parent Indemnification Claim, Parent shall
not be entitled to seek indemnity under this _Article VII_ for Losses, and
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no further recourse against any
Person for any claim, breach or other matter, arising out of a breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.3_.

  



    

80

 



    



  

(e) _Losses Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Third-Party
Recoveries_. All Losses for which any Parent Indemnified Party would
otherwise be entitled to indemnification under this _Article VII_ shall be
reduced by the net amount of insurance proceeds, indemnification payments and
other third-party recoveries actually received by any Parent Indemnified Party
in respect of any Losses incurred by such Parent Indemnified Party. In the
event any Parent Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates is entitled to any
insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or any third-party recoveries in
respect of any Losses (or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto) for
which such Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 7.3(e)_ , such Parent Indemnified Party shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, benefits, payments
or recoveries. In the event that any such insurance proceeds, indemnity
payments or other third-party recoveries not previously taken into account are
obtained by a Parent Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Parent
Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the
claims to which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-
party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the
relevant Parent Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of such
recovery, appropriate payments shall be made promptly by the relevant Parent
Indemnified Parties. All such payments or recoveries shall be determined net
of any expenses, costs or other fees incurred by the Parent Indemnified Party,
including any loss or erosion of coverage, increase in premiums or the costs
and expenses of outside counsel and other advisors to such Parent Indemnified
Party.

  



  

(f) _Assignment of Claims_. Upon payment of any Losses is made with
respect to a Parent Indemnification Claim pursuant to this _Article VII_
, the Selling Equityholders shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment
to the rights of the Parent Indemnified Party against any Person with respect
to the subject matter of such Parent Indemnification Claim. The Parent
Indemnified Party shall assign such rights to and otherwise reasonably
cooperate with Seller Representative, at the cost and expense of the Selling
Equityholders, to pursue any claims against or otherwise recover amounts
from, any Person liable or responsible for any Losses for which
indemnification has been received pursuant to this Agreement

  



  

(g) _Losses Included in Aggregate Purchase Price_. No Parent
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses in
respect of any liability included as a deduction for purposes of the
calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price and then only to the extent of
the amount so deducted.

  



  

(h) _No Duplicate Claims_. In the event a Parent Indemnified Party
recovers Losses in respect of a Parent Indemnification Claim, no other Parent
Indemnified Party may recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement.

  



  

7.4 _Characterization of Payments_. For Tax purposes, the parties
agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to treat)
any indemnity payment under this _Article VII_ as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Article II_.

  



    

81

 



    



  

7.5 _Third Party Claims._

  



  

(a) Promptly after receipt by any Parent Indemnified Party of notice
of the commencement or assertion of any action, proceeding, demand, claim or
investigation by a third party (an " _Asserted Liability_ ") that may result
in a Loss which is indemnifiable under this _Article VII_ , such Parent
Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver a Claim Notice with respect thereto
to Seller Representative; _provided_ that a failure to provide such Claim
Notice promptly shall not amount to a waiver of such claim unless and only to
the extent that the resulting delay materially prejudices the position of the
Selling Equityholders, as the indemnifying party, with respect to such claim.

  



  

(b) Seller Representative shall have thirty (30) days from receipt
of the Claim Notice (or less if the nature of the claim requires and such
necessary shortened deadline is specified in the Claim Notice) (the " _Notice
Period_ ") to notify the Parent Indemnified Party in writing (i) whether or
not Seller Representative disputes the liability to the Parent Indemnified
Party hereunder with respect to the Loss, and (ii) whether or not Seller
Representative desires at the cost and expense of the Selling Equityholders
to defend the Parent Indemnified Party against such Asserted Liability
(regardless of whether or not it disputes the liability with respect to such
Asserted Liability). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller Representative
shall not be entitled to assume control of the defense of an Asserted
Liability without Parent's written consent (in its sole discretion) if
(i) such Asserted Liability relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, indictment, allegation or investigation of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, by
a Governmental Entity, (ii) the Asserted Liability seeks to impose any
material liability, obligation or restriction upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, other
than for money damages, (iii) the amount of claimed Losses relating to such
Claim exceeds the value of the remaining Reserved Shares or (iv) counsel to
Parent has advised Parent that there are one or more defenses available to
the Parent Indemnified Party that are not available to the Selling
Equityholders or a conflict of interest exists between the Parent Indemnified
Party and the Selling Equityholders, in the opinion of counsel to the Parent
Indemnified Party, in respect of such Asserted Liability.

  



  

(c) If Seller Representative notifies the Parent Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Parent
Indemnified Party against an Asserted Liability, subject to _Section 7.5(b)_
, Seller Representative shall have the right to defend all appropriate
proceedings with counsel of its own choosing (but reasonably satisfactory to
the Parent Indemnified Party) and such proceedings shall be diligently
prosecuted by it. If Seller Representative exercises the right to undertake
any such defense against any Asserted Liability, (i) the Parent Indemnified
Party shall provide reasonable cooperation to Seller Representative in
such defense, at the Selling Equityholders' cost and expense, (ii) Seller
Representative shall keep the Parent Indemnified Party appraised of material
developments regarding such Asserted Liability and (iii) the Parent
Indemnified Party may elect, at such Parent Indemnified Party's sole cost and
expense, to participate in such defense with separate counsel of its choice.

  



  

(d) If Seller Representative elects not to defend the Parent
Indemnified Party against an Asserted Liability or does not provide an
answer within the Notice Period or Parent does not consent to Seller
Representative assuming control of the defense under _Section 7.5(b)_
, Parent shall be entitled to assume control of and appoint lead counsel for
defense of such Asserted Liability and all reasonable fees and expenses of
one firm of attorneys (in addition to local counsel to the extent reasonably
necessary) in connection thereof shall be considered Losses for purposes of
this _Article VII_ and shall be subject to indemnification hereunder. If
Parent undertakes the defense of any Asserted Liability in accordance with
this _Section 7.5(d)_ , (i) Seller Representative shall provide reasonable
cooperation to Parent in such defense, (ii) Parent shall keep Seller
Representative appraised of material developments regarding such Asserted
Liability, and (iii) Seller Representative may elect, at the Selling
Equityholders' sole cost and expense, to participate in such defense with
separate counsel of its choice.

  



    

82

 



    



  

7.6 _Direct Claims_. In any case in which a Parent Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification hereunder which is not subject to _Section 7.5_ ,
such Parent Indemnified Party shall promptly notify Seller Representative in
writing of any Losses that such Parent Indemnified Party claims are subject
to indemnification under the terms hereof. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article VII_ , the failure of a Parent Indemnified Party to
provide prompt notice of such claim shall not amount to a waiver of such claim
unless and only to the extent that the resulting delay materially prejudices
the position of the Selling Equityholders, as the indemnifying party, with
respect to such claim.

  



  

7.7 _Indemnification through Surrender of Deferred Payment
Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in _Sections 7.2_ or _7.3_ hereof, in
the event the Selling Equityholders are entitled to receive any deferred
payment in accordance with _Section 2.9_ with respect to an amount of Excess
Shares, and to the extent such payment with respect to such Excess Shares
remains outstanding as of the final resolution of such Parent Indemnification
Claim, then for each such Excess Share with respect to which the Selling
Equityholders are entitled to deferred payment, the number of Reserved Shares
shall be adjusted downwards by one Reserved Share, and the surrender of the
right to receive the deferred payment associated with up to 3,500,000 Excess
Shares, if any (the " _Reserved Deferred Payment Shares_ ") shall be the
initial source of payment to any Parent Indemnified Party to recover Losses
pursuant to this _Article VII_ (and, to the extent that the number of
Reserved Deferred Payment Shares equals or exceeds 3,500,000, the sole source
of payment to any Parent Indemnified Party to recover any Losses pursuant to
this _Article VII_ to the extent the deferred payment right with respect to
such Excess Shares remains outstanding as of the final resolution of a Parent
Indemnification Claim), with the right to receive deferred payment valued at
$10.00 per Reserved Deferred Payment Share (regardless of the then current
trading price of Parent Common Stock). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent there is any adjustment to the Excess Shares pursuant to _Section
2.9(e)_ , the number of the Reserved Deferred Payment Shares shall be
equitably adjusted in the same ratio to reflect the change in the amount of
outstanding Excess Shares. Prior to the expiration of the Survival Period,
the Selling Equityholders shall not be entitled to receive any payment with
respect to such Reserved Deferred Payment Shares under  _Section 2.9_ and, in
the event Parent is no longer subject to a deferred payment obligation with
respect to such Reserved Deferred Payment Shares, Seller Representative shall
cause the Selling Equityholders to replace such Reserved Deferred
Payment Shares with Reserved Shares, on a one-for-one basis, as a source of
payment for its obligations in this _Article VII_.

9.5 _Rules of Construction_

  

.

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been
represented by counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that
have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the
same with the advice of said independent counsel. Each party and its counsel
cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents
referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between
the parties shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not be
construed against any party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any
rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement against any party that drafted it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived.

  



  

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such
information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule,
as applicable, that such information is required to be listed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or that
such items are material to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may
be. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule are inserted for
convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a
part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure
Schedule are arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in this
Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule as
an exception to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed
adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other
representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to
such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such
item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule with respect to
such other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference
thereto; _provided_ that, no item shall be deemed disclosed against _Sections
3.1(f)_ or _3.2(f)_ unless specifically set forth in the relevant
corresponding section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure
Schedule, without cross-reference.

  



    

96

 



    



  

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations
and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall
not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such
amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy
between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter
(whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules,
Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the
corresponding Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other
subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles
appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other
subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute
any part of such Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and
shall be disregarded in construing the language contained therein. The words
"this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof" and words of
similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this Section," "this
subsection" and words of similar import, refer only to the Sections or
subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word "including" (in its
various forms) means "including, without limitation." Pronouns in masculine,
feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include any other
gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein) in the
singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless
the context otherwise expressly requires. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all defined terms contained herein shall include the singular and
plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such defined terms.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to a specific time shall
refer to Houston, Texas time.

  



  

9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by electronic means), all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when two or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

  



  

9.7 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (together with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other
documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire
agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. The provisions of _Sections 5.5_ , _5.10(e)_ ,  _9.9(b)_ , _9.12_
and, from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the provisions of
_Article II_ and _Article VII_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable after the Company Merger Effective Time by, the
Persons referred to therein and their respective heirs and representatives;
and the provisions of _Sections 5.10_, _9.9_ ,  _9.12_ and _9.15_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Financing
Sources. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, this
Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



    

97

 



    



  

9.8 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred
hereby, and the exercise by a party of any one such remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other such remedy.

  



  

(b) The parties understand and agree that the covenants and
undertakings on each of their parts herein contained are uniquely related
to the desire of the parties and their respective Affiliates to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, that the transactions contemplated
hereby represent a unique business opportunity at a unique time for each of
the parties hereto and their respective Affiliates and further agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms and further agree
that, although monetary damages may be available for the breach of such
covenants and undertakings, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy
therefor. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by Blocker
or the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, Blocker Merger Sub or Company
Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, Blocker or the Company, on the one
hand, or Parent, Blocker Merger Sub or Company Merger Sub, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other
under this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction. In the event
that any litigation should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of
this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereto hereby waives
the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 9.8(b)_ to the contrary,
the parties hereto hereby further acknowledge and agree that the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to enforce
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with  _Section
5.10(b)_, if and only if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_
and _Section 6.2_  have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), (ii) Parent and/or
Company Merger Sub and/or Blocker Merger Sub fails to complete the Closing by
the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_
and (iii) all of the conditions to the consummation of the financing provided
by the Debt Commitment Letter (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with _Section 5.10(a)_, pursuant to the commitments with
respect thereto) have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing).

  



  

(d) The remedies available to the parties hereto pursuant to this
_Section 9.8_ shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is
entitled at law or in equity. To the extent any party hereto brings an action,
suit or proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any
provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when
expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit
or proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action, suit or proceeding.

  



    

98

 



    



  

9.9 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof; _provided_ that, except as
specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Financing Source, or any of its representatives, in any way
relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or
rules or conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would
require or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction.

COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE

IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED BY SUCH A DELAWARE STATE OR FEDERAL
COURT. THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO AND GRANT ANY SUCH COURT
JURISDICTION OVER THE PERSON OF SUCH PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
SUCH DISPUTE AND AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION
WITH SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION 9.3_
OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW SHALL BE VALID AND
SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto hereby agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Source, or any of its representatives, in
any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located
within the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, whether a
state or Federal court, and that the provisions of _Section 9.9(c)_ relating
to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim. No amendment or modification to this
_Section 9.9(b)_ and _Section 9.9(a)_ above shall be effective without the
prior written consent of each Financing Source and each Financing Source
shall be an express third party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to
enforce, this _Section 9.9(b)_ and _Section 9.9(a)_  above.

(c) EACH PARTY AND THE SELLER GROUP ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER
AND THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (III)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.9_.

  



  

9.10 _No Remedy in Certain Circumstances_. Each party agrees that,
should any court or other competent authority hold any provision of this
Agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party
to take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent
herewith or required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing
inconsistent action or the failure to take an action constitutes a material
breach of this Agreement or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in
which case this Agreement shall terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or
anything otherwise to the contrary contained herein, to the extent a court or
other competent authority holds _Section 9.12_ or _Section 9.17_ to be null,
void or unenforceable, this Agreement shall terminate automatically without
liability to any Person, and the parties obligations hereunder shall no
longer by valid or enforceable. Except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement, to the extent that a party hereto took an action
inconsistent herewith or failed to take action consistent herewith or
required hereby pursuant to an order or judgment of a court or other
competent authority, such party shall not incur any liability or obligation
unless such party breached its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement or did not in good faith seek to resist or object
to the imposition or entering of such order or judgment.

  



    

100

 



    



  

9.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties; _provided_ that Parent may assign this
Agreement and its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Company to any of the Financing Sources of Parent, Blocker Merger Sub or
Company Merger Sub (including the applicable secured parties pursuant to the
terms of any of the Debt Documents to the extent necessary for purposes of
creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in
respect of the Debt Financing); _provided_ , _further_ that no assignment to
any Financing Sources in accordance herewith shall in any way affect
Parent's, Blocker Merger Sub's or Company Merger Sub's obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Any purported
assignment in violation of this _Section 9.11_ shall be void.

  



  

9.12 _Affiliate Liability; Release_. Except to the extent a named
party to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that no past, present or future member of the Purchaser
Group, the Seller Group or any Financing Source (each a " _Non-
Recourse Party_ "), in such capacity, shall have any liability or obligation
(in contract, tort, or otherwise) to any party hereto of any nature
whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and each of the
parties hereto (on behalf of itself, its Affiliates, and its equityholders,
managers, officers, directors, employees and agents) hereby waives and
releases all claims of any such liability and obligation. This Agreement
may only be enforced against, and any action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement (including the Debt Commitment Letter), or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including with

entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect
to the specific obligations set forth herein or therein with respect to such
party. Each Non-Recourse Party is expressly intended as a third-
party beneficiary of this _Section 9.12_. Nothing in this _Section 9.12_
shall affect the rights and remedies of any party to the Debt Commitment
Letter against any other party thereto.

  



  

9.13 _Privilege; Conflicts_. Recognizing that Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.
has acted as legal counsel to Company Sponsor, its Affiliates, the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and that Vinson and Elkins
L.L.P. intends to act as legal counsel to Company Sponsor and its Affiliates
(including the Affiliates of TPG Capital)(collectively, the " _Selling
Parties_ ") after the Closing, each of Parent, Blocker and the Company, on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries, hereby waives, on its own behalf and
agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. representing the Selling Parties after
the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent, Blocker and the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or the transactions
contemplated herein. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client
confidences between the Selling Parties, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely
to the Seller Group (and not the Blocker, Company or their respective
Subsidiaries). Accordingly, Blocker, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files
of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. relating to engagement, whether or not the Closing
shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon
and after the Closing, (a) the Seller Group shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of
Blocker, the Company nor their respective Subsidiaries shall be a holder
thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. in respect of
such engagement constitute property of the client, only the Seller Group (and
not Blocker, the Company nor their respective Subsidiaries) shall hold such
property rights and (c) Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. shall have no duty whatsoever
to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any
of Blocker, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. and any of
Blocker, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or otherwise.

  



    

101

 



    



  

9.14 _Joint Liability._ Each representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement made by Parent, Blocker Merger Sub or Company Merger Sub in this
Agreement on the one hand, and Blocker and the Company on the other hand,
shall be deemed a representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by
Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub jointly on the one hand, and
Blocker and the Company on the other hand, and all liability and obligations
relating thereto shall be deemed a joint liability and obligation of
Parent, Blocker Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub or Blocker and the Company,
as the case may be.

  



  

9.15 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, at any time before or after the receipt of the Parent Stockholder
Approval, but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by
law would require the further approval by such stockholders without first
obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed (including by electronic means) on behalf of
each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this _Section 9.15_ , none of _Section 5.10_, _Section 9.7_ , _Section
9.9_ , _Section 9.12_ or this sentence may be modified or amended in a manner
that is material and adverse in any respect to any Financing Source without
the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

  



  

9.16 _Seller Representative._

  



  

(a) Each Selling Equityholder has, or prior to the Closing and as a
condition to receiving its portion of the Merger Consideration will have,
constituted, appointed and empowered, effective from and after the Closing
Date, New Holdco to act as a representative for the Selling Equityholders (in
such capacity, as " _Seller Representative_ "), for the benefit of the Selling
Equityholders and as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on
behalf of each Selling Equityholder, with respect to the matters specified in
this _Section 9.16_ , which shall include the power and authority: (i) to
enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Selling Equityholders and

or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement and the transactions
provided for herein, from and after the Closing, and to take any and
all actions which Seller Representative believes are necessary or appropriate
under this Agreement with respect to any actions provided for in _Sections
2.6_ , _2.9_ and _Article VII_ , for and on behalf of the Selling
Equityholders including (A) consenting to, compromising or settling any
objections set forth in the Objection Statement, conducting negotiations with
Parent regarding such claims and in connection therewith, (B) directing the
method of payment for any deferred payments owed to the Selling
Equityholders pursuant to _Section 2.9_ __ and coordinating with Parent with
respect thereto and (C) consenting to, compromising or settling any Parent
Indemnification Claims, conducting negotiations with Parent regarding such
claims and in connection therewith, it being understood, in the case of each
of (A), (B) and (C), that Seller Representative shall not have any obligation
to take any actions, and shall not have any liability for any failure to take
any actions; (ii) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other
agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests,
instructions, certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in
general, to do any and all things and to take any and all action that Seller
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary
or proper or convenient in connection therewith and (iii) to engage outside
counsel, accountants and other advisors and incur such other expenses on
behalf of the Selling Equityholders in connection with any matter arising
under this Agreement.

  



    

102

 



    



  

(b) Parent shall have the right to rely upon all actions taken or
omitted to be taken by Seller Representative pursuant to this Agreement, all
of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon the Selling

9.17 _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Company and Blocker
acknowledges that Parent is a blank check company with the powers and
privileges to effect a Business Combination. Each of the Company and Blocker
further acknowledges that, as described in the prospectus dated June 5, 2014
(the " _Prospectus_ ") available at _www.sec.gov_ , substantially all of
Parent's assets consist of the cash proceeds of Parent's initial public
offering and private placements of its securities and substantially all of
those proceeds have been deposited in the Trust Account for the benefit of
Parent, certain of its public stockholders and the underwriters of Parent's
initial public offering. Each of the Company and Blocker acknowledges that it
has been advised by Parent that, except with respect to interest earned on
the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to Parent to pay its
franchise tax, income tax and similar obligations, the Trust Agreement
provides that cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) to Parent
in limited amounts from time to time in order to permit Parent to pay its
operating expenses; (ii) if Parent completes the transactions which
constitute a Business Combination, then to those Persons and in such amounts
as described in the Prospectus; and (iii) if Parent fails to complete a
Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject
to the terms of the Trust Agreement, to Parent in limited amounts to permit
Parent to pay the costs and expenses of its liquidation and dissolution, and
then to Parent's public stockholders. For and in consideration of Parent
entering into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, each of the Company and Blocker, on behalf of Seller Group,
hereby irrevocable waives any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they
have or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust Account and
agree not to seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed
therefrom as a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and any
negotiations, contracts or agreements with Parent; _provided_ that (x)
nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company's and Blocker's
right to pursue a claim against Parent for legal relief against monies or
other assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific performance or other
equitable relief in connection with the consummation of the transactions
(including a claim for Parent to specifically perform its obligations under
this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining
in the Trust Account (after giving effect to the Parent Stockholder
Redemptions) to the Seller Group in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long as such claim would not affect
Parent's ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the Parent
Stockholder Redemptions, or for fraud and (y) nothing herein shall serve to
limit or prohibit any claims that the Company and Blocker may have in the
future against Parent's assets or funds that are not held in the Trust
Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account
and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds).
