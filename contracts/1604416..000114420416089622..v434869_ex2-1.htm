setting forth a calculation of the final Aggregate Purchase Price and each of the components thereof (including the PlasChem Net
Indebtedness) and attach reasonable documentation supporting Parent&rsquo;s calculations. In the event Parent does not deliver
the Adjustment Schedule within the seventy-five (75) day period specified in the immediately preceding sentence, at Seller Representative&rsquo;s

of assisting Seller Representative and its Representatives in their review of the Adjustment Schedule. The Adjustment Schedule
and the resulting calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price shall become final and binding upon the parties hereto thirty (30)
days following Seller Representative&rsquo;s receipt of the Adjustment Schedule unless Seller Representative provides written notice
of its objection (an &ldquo;<U>Objection Statement</U>&rdquo;) to Parent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.
Any Objection Statement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted, a reasonably

Representative shall have timely delivered an Objection Statement to Parent, Parent and Seller Representative may negotiate to

resolve each of Seller Representative&rsquo;s objections as set forth on the Objection Statement, the Adjustment Schedule, as revised
pursuant to such negotiations, shall become final and binding upon the parties hereto. If, following such thirty (30) day period,
any of the objections set forth on the Objection Statement shall remain outstanding, Parent or Seller Representative may refer
such disputed items for resolution by an internationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to Parent and
Seller Representative; <U>provided </U>that in the event that Parent and Seller Representative fail to agree thereon, the accounting
firm shall be Ernst &amp; Young LLP (such firm, the &ldquo;<U>Independent Accountant</U>&rdquo;); <U>provided </U>that if Ernst
&amp; Young LLP is unwilling or unable to serve as the Independent Accountant and Seller Representative and Parent are unable to
select an alternative firm within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Objection Statement, either Parent or Seller Representative
may request the American Arbitration Association appoint, within twenty (20) days from the date of such request, an internationally
recognized independent accounting firm. Each of Parent and Seller Representative shall promptly provide their assertions regarding
the Aggregate Purchase Price in writing to the Independent Accountant and to each other. The Independent Accountant shall be instructed
to render its determination with respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably practicable (which shall be no later than
forty-five (45) days following the date on which the remaining objections are referred to the Independent Accountant). The Independent
Accountant shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator and shall base its determination solely upon the written submissions of
Parent and Seller Representative, any oral advocacy by each of Parent and Seller Representative in front of the Independent Accountant
and the applicable provisions of this Agreement (and shall not conduct an independent investigation). Without limiting the foregoing,
the Independent Accountant will resolve the dispute with respect to each disputed component of the Aggregate Purchase Price by
assigning a value, as determined by the Independent Accountant, to each component thereof, that is no higher than the highest amount,
or lowest than the lowest amount, claimed with respect to such item in Seller Representative&rsquo;s final calculation thereof
(as modified following discussions with Parent and as submitted to the Independent Accountant at the outset of the dispute resolution
process with a copy to Parent) or Parent&rsquo;s final calculation thereof (as modified following discussions with Seller Representative
and as submitted to the Independent Accountant at the outset of the dispute resolution process with a copy to Seller Representative),
as applicable. The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto, and
no such Person shall seek further recourse from any other Person or Governmental Entity other than to enforce the determination
of the Independent Accountant. All fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant relating to the work, if any, to be performed
by the Independent Accountant hereunder shall be borne by the Selling Equityholders on the one hand, and Parent on the other hand,
based on the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested
by such party and such allocation of fees and expenses shall be calculated by the Independent Accountant and shall be final and
binding on the parties. As used herein, the &ldquo;<U>Final Aggregate Purchase Price</U>&rdquo; means the amount of the Aggregate
Purchase Price, as finally determined by this <U>Section 2.6(a)</U>.</P>

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has all requisite
corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification necessary, other
than in such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or be in good standing would not be reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of its certificate of formation (the &ldquo;<U>Company Certificate of Formation</U>&rdquo;), and its Amended and Restated
Limited Liability Company Agreement, dated as of April&nbsp;1, 2011 (the &ldquo;<U>Company LLC Agreement</U>&rdquo;) as well as

means any occurrence, condition, change, event or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, is or would reasonably be expected

its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or that prevents or materially delays or impairs, or would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay or impair, the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that in no event shall any of the following constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect: (A) any occurrence, condition,
change, event or effect resulting from or relating to changes in general economic, regulatory or political conditions or conditions
in the United States or worldwide capital markets; (B) any occurrence, condition, change, event or effect that affects the industries
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate generally (including changes in commodity prices, general market prices and regulatory
changes) to the extent that such change does not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a disproportionate impact on
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other industry participants; (C) any occurrence, condition,
change, event or effect resulting from or relating to fluctuations in the value of currencies; (D) the outbreak or escalation of
hostilities involving the United States, the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence
of any other similar calamity or crisis, including natural disasters and acts of terrorism; (E) any occurrence, condition, change,
event or effect resulting from the announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any termination
of, reduction in or similar negative impact on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with any customers, suppliers, distributors,
partners or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries due to the announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (<U>provided </U>that, this clause (E) shall not be applicable with respect to the Company&rsquo;s representations
and warranties in <U>Section 3.1(c)(ii)</U> and to the extent related thereto, the condition in <U>Section 6.2(a)</U>); (F) any
change in the trading prices or trading volume of the Company&rsquo;s debt instruments or the credit ratings assigned thereto (but
not any change or effect underlying such change in prices, volume or credit rating to the extent such change or effect would otherwise
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect); (G) any change in accounting requirements or principles imposed upon the Company,
its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or any change in law, or the interpretation thereof; (H) any occurrence, condition,
change, event or effect resulting from actions taken by Parent or any Affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act, an &ldquo;<U>Affiliate</U>&rdquo;) of Parent; and (I) compliance by the Company with the terms of this Agreement
or any written request of Parent; and (ii) &ldquo;<U>Subsidiary</U>&rdquo; means, with respect to any party, any corporation or
other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which: (1) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a
general partner; or (2) at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to
elect a majority of the Board of Directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other organization

in <U>Article VI</U>, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied

Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make Debt Financing
available to Parent on the terms therein. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements to which Parent

than to a Parent Indemnified Party in accordance with this <U>Article VII</U>, 3,500,000 shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares,
together, the &ldquo;<U>Reserved Shares</U>&rdquo;), which shall be the sole source of payment to any Parent Indemnified Party
to recover any Losses pursuant to this <U>Article VII</U>. The Reserved Shares shall be imprinted with a legend sufficient to identify
the restriction on transfer thereof set forth in this <U>Section 7.2</U>. Upon termination of the Survival Period, the Selling
Equityholders shall be permitted to freely transfer any Reserved Shares other than, to the extent applicable, a number of Reserved
Shares equal in value to the amount of Losses asserted with respect to any Parent Indemnification Claim in accordance with this
Agreement asserted prior to the termination of the Survival Period and still pending upon the termination of the Survival Period
(a &ldquo;<U>Pending Claim</U>&rdquo;). Upon the resolution of all of such Pending Claims, subject to the termination of the Survival
Period, any Reserved Shares not required to be transferred to a Parent Indemnified Party as payment with respect to such Pending
Claim shall cease to be subject to the restrictions of this <U>Section 7.2</U> and shall be freely transferrable by the Selling
Equityholders and no longer available as a source of payment for any Parent Indemnification Claim hereunder.</P>

consist of the cash proceeds of Parent&rsquo;s initial public offering and private placements of its securities and substantially

by Parent that, except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to Parent to
pay its franchise tax, income tax and similar obligations, the Trust Agreement provides that cash in the Trust Account may be
disbursed only (i)&nbsp;to Parent in limited amounts from time to time in order to permit Parent to pay its operating expenses;

described in the Prospectus; and (iii) if Parent fails to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time period and
liquidates, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement, to Parent in limited amounts to permit Parent to pay the costs and expenses
of its liquidation and dissolution, and then to Parent&rsquo;s public stockholders. For and in consideration of Parent entering
