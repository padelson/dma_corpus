ARTICLE 2 
PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 2.01. Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer agrees to purchase from the Sellers,
and the Sellers, as applicable, agree to sell to Buyer, free and clear of all
Liens, the Shares.

Section 2.02. Purchase Price. %3. The purchase price for the Shares (the
"Purchase Price") shall equal the sum of (%4) the Estimated Closing Purchase
Price and (%4) whether positive or negative, if applicable, the Adjustment
Amount. The Purchase Price shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.05 and
shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.06 and Section 7.06.

(a) The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Shares as set forth in the
statement attached hereto as Annex B (the "Allocation Statement"). If an
adjustment is made with respect to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.06
or otherwise, any adjustment shall be allocated among the Shares as agreed by
Buyer and the Sellers, and the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted in a
manner consistent therewith. In the event that an agreement as to the
allocation of such adjustment is not reached within 60 days after the
determination of the Adjustment Amount or other event giving rise to an
adjustment, Buyer and the Sellers shall jointly retain an Auditor (as defined
in Section 2.06(c) below) to resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of
the disputed items, the allocations reflected on the Allocation Statement
shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of
the Auditor in connection with any disputed items pursuant to this Section
2.02(b) shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on
the other hand. Sellers and Buyer agreed to be bound by the Allocation
Statement (as such Allocation Statement may be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 2.02(b)) and to act in accordance with the Allocation Statement in the
preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return.

(b)

(i) The parties agree and intend that the purchase and sale of the Tiger's
Milk Shares shall be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a
purchase and sale of the assets of Tiger's Milk. With respect to the portion
of the Purchase Price allocated to the Tiger's Milk Shares pursuant to Section
2.02(b), as promptly as practicable after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to
Sellers a statement (the "TM Allocation Statement"), allocating the portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to the Tiger's Milk Shares (plus the liabilities
of Tiger's Milk, if any, to the extent properly taken into account under
Section 1060 of the Code) among the assets of Tiger's Milk in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code. If, within 10 days after the delivery of the TM
Allocation Statement, Sellers notify Buyer in writing that Sellers object to
the allocation set forth in the TM Allocation Statement, Buyer and Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within 20
days. In the event that Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve such dispute
within 20 days, Buyer and Sellers shall jointly retain an Auditor (as defined
in Section 2.06(c) below) to resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of
the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the TM Allocation Statement
shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of
the Auditor shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on
the other hand.

(ii) Sellers and Buyer agree to (i) be bound by the TM Allocation Statement
and (ii) act in accordance with the TM Allocation Statement in the
preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return (including filing Form 8594
with its federal income Tax return for the taxable year that includes the date
of the Closing).

(iii) If an adjustment is made with respect to the portion of the Purchase
Price allocated to the Tiger's Milk Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(b), the TM
Allocation Statement shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and as mutually agreed by Buyer and Sellers, at the same time and using
the same procedures, mutatis mutandis, as set forth in Section 2.02(b). Buyer
and Sellers agree to file any additional information return required to be
filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and to treat the TM Allocation
Statement as adjusted in the manner described in Section 2.02(c)(i).

Section 2.03. Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the closing (the "Closing") of the transactions contemplated by Section 2.01
shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington
Avenue, New York, New York 10017 or remotely by the exchange of signature
pages for executed documents, as promptly as practicable (but no later than
three (3) Business Days) after the date on which all conditions set forth in
Article 8 shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such other time or place as
Buyer and the Sellers may agree.

Section 2.04. Estimated Closing Calculations. Not less than three Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a written
statement setting forth %3. the Sellers' good faith estimates of (%4) Closing
Net Working Capital ("Estimated Closing Net Working Capital"), (%4) Closing
Indebtedness ("Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), (%4) Closing Cash ("Estimated
Closing Cash") and (iv) Closing Transaction Expenses ("Estimated Transaction
Expenses"), %3. the Sellers' calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount and %3. on the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the
Estimated Closing Purchase Price (together with the calculations referred to
in clauses (a) and (b) above, the "Preliminary Closing Statement"). The
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, the
Estimated Closing Cash and the Estimated Transaction Expenses shall be
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles. The Sellers shall
consult in good faith with Buyer in preparation of the Preliminary Closing
Statement.

Section 2.05. Closing Deliverables. %3. At or prior to Closing, the Sellers
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer:

(i) certificates for the Shares, if any, duly endorsed or accompanied by, as
applicable, stock powers, limited liability company interest powers, or other
instruments of transfer;

(ii) duly executed stock transfer form(s) with respect to French's UK Shares;

(iii) a power of attorney in reasonably customary form authorizing Buyer or
its designee to exercise the rights attaching to the French's UK Shares
pending registration;

(iv) a properly executed statement, in accordance with United States Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) and in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, certifying that French's US is not, and has never been, a
United States real property holding corporation;

(v) with respect to the Tiger's Milk Seller, a properly signed certification
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) certifying that it is
not a "foreign person" as defined in Section 1445 of the Code;

(vi) the certificate referred to in Section 8.01(b)(iii);

(vii) the resignation letters referred to in Section 5.19 or evidence of
removal or termination, in each case in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer; and

(viii) a counterpart to the Transition Services Agreement duly executed by
Reckitt Benckiser Corporate Services Limited;

(b) At or before Closing, Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Sellers:

(i) the certificate referred to in Section 8.01(c)(iii); and

(ii) a counterpart to the Transition Services Agreement duly executed by
Buyer.

(c) At Closing, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the Estimated Closing Purchase
Price in US dollars and in immediately available funds by wire transfer to
Sellers' Bank Account.

Section 2.06. Adjustment Amount. %3. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, and in any event within 60 calendar days thereof,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers, (%4) a calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital, (%4) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all Closing
Indebtedness, (%4) a calculation of Closing Cash, (%4) Buyer's calculation of
the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, (%4) a calculation of
Closing Transaction Expenses and on the basis of the foregoing (%4) a
calculation of the Closing Purchase Price (together with the calculations
referred to in clauses (i) through (vi) above, the "Final Closing Statement").
The Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Cash shall
be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and the defined terms
used in this Section 2.06(a); provided, however, that the Final Closing
Statement (and any amounts included therein) shall not give effect to any act
or omission by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or the Companies taken after
the Closing or reflect any payments of cash in respect of the Purchase Price,
or any financing transactions in connection therewith or reflect any expense
or liability for which Buyer is responsible under this Agreement or the
payment of the Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, neither party shall
dispute the definition, scope or the application of the Accounting Principles
or any inconsistencies between GAAP and any Accounting Principle(s). No fact
or event, including any market or business development, occurring after the
Closing Date, and no change in GAAP or Applicable Law after the Balance Sheet
Date, shall be taken into consideration in the calculations to be made
pursuant to Section 2.04 or this Section 2.06. If Buyer fails to timely
deliver the Final Closing Statement in accordance with the first sentence of
this Section 2.06(a) within such 60-day period, then, at the election of the
Sellers in their sole discretion either (x) the Preliminary Closing Statement
delivered by the Sellers to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.04 shall be deemed to
be the Final Closing Statement, for all purposes hereunder or (y) the Sellers
shall be entitled to retain the Auditor to provide an audit of the books of
the Companies, determine the calculation of, and prepare, the Final Closing
Statement consistent with the provisions of Section 2.06(c), the determination
of such Auditor being conclusive, final and binding on the parties hereto.

(a) Following the Closing, each of the Sellers and Buyer shall provide the
other party and its Representatives reasonable access upon reasonable written
notice to its records, properties, personnel and (subject to the execution of
customary work paper access letters if requested) auditors relating to the
preparation or review of the Final Closing Statement and upon reasonable
written notice shall cause its personnel to cooperate with the other party in
connection with such party's preparation or review of the Final Closing
Statement, in each case at the requesting party's expense.

(b) If the Sellers shall disagree with any of Buyer's calculations contained
in the Final Closing Statement, they shall notify Buyer of such disagreement
in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such
disagreement, within 45 days after their receipt of the Final Closing
Statement. In the event that the Sellers do not provide such a notice of
disagreement within such 45 day period, the Sellers shall be deemed to have
agreed to the Final Closing Statement (including the determinations included
therein) delivered by Buyer, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely
provided, Buyer and the Sellers shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts for a period of 30 days (or such longer period as they may mutually
agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to any calculations contained
in the Final Closing Statement. Any determination set forth in the Final
Closing Statement that is not objected to in such a notice of disagreement
shall be deemed acceptable and shall be final, binding and conclusive on Buyer
and the Sellers upon delivery of such notice of disagreement. If, at the end
of such thirty (30) day-period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements,
then either Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers, on the other hand, may
submit any such remaining disagreements (such remaining disagreements, the
"Disputed Items") to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu or such other independent
accounting firm of internationally recognized standing as may be mutually
selected by Buyer and the Sellers (such firm, the "Auditor"). Buyer and the
Sellers shall promptly provide their assertions regarding the Disputed Items
in writing to the Auditor and to each other. The Auditor shall be instructed
to render a written statement setting forth its final determination (and a
reasonably detailed description of the basis therefor) with respect to the
Disputed Items as soon as reasonably possible (which the parties hereto agree
should not be later than 60 days following the date on which the disagreement
is referred to the Auditor). The Auditor shall base its determination solely
on (%4) the written submissions of the parties and shall not conduct an
independent investigation, (%4) the extent (if any) to which Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Net Working
Capital Adjustment and/or Closing Transaction Expenses require adjustment
(only with respect to the Disputed Items submitted to the Auditor) in order to
be determined in accordance with Section 2.06(a) (including the definitions of
the defined terms used in Section 2.06(a) and the Accounting Principles) and
(iii) the extent (if any) to which there were mathematical errors in the
calculation of the items within the Disputed Items. The Auditor shall not
assign a value to any Disputed Item submitted to the Auditor greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either party. The determination of the Auditor
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties, absent manifest error.
The date on which Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash, Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, Closing Transaction
Expenses and Closing Purchase Price are finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.06(c) is hereinafter referred to as the "Determination Date."
All fees and expenses of the Auditor relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Auditor hereunder shall be borne between Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon a fraction, the numerator
of which is the portion of the aggregate amount of the Disputed Items not
awarded to the applicable party and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of the Disputed Items. For example, if the Sellers challenge items
underlying the calculations of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash in the net amount of $1,000,000, and the
Auditor determines that the Sellers have a valid claim for $400,000 of the
$1,000,000, the Sellers shall bear 60% of the fees and expenses of the Auditor
and Buyer shall bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the Auditor. All other
fees and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection with resolving
any dispute hereunder before the Auditor shall be borne by the party incurring
such cost and expense.

(c) The "Adjustment Amount," which may be positive or negative, shall mean the
Closing Purchase Price (as finally determined in accordance with Section
2.06(a) or 2.06(c), as applicable) minus the Estimated Closing Purchase Price.
The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.06(e).

(d) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number (such amount, the "Increase
Amount"), then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event
within three Business Days of the Determination Date, Buyer shall pay to the
Sellers an amount equal to the Increase Amount in immediately available funds
by wire transfer to Sellers' Bank Account or such other account designated by
the Sellers. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value
of such amount, the "Deficit Amount"), then, promptly following the
Determination Date, and in any event within three Business Days of the
Determination Date, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
Deficit Amount in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
of Buyer designated by Buyer.

(e) Any payment owed pursuant to Section 2.06(e) shall also bear interest from
and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate
per annum equal to 2% per annum compounded quarterly. Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed.

Section 2.07. Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each party and its Affiliates shall be entitled (a) to deduct and
withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld) from any amount payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of the U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law or under any applicable legal
requirement and (b) to request any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or
the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information,
from any Person to whom a payment is required to be made pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, with respect to clause (a), that the party making
deduction or withholding (or causing deduction or withholding to be made)
shall (i) furnish to the other party at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date (or other date on which any payment is due) a written notice
of its intention to deduct or withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld)
any amounts from any payment and (ii) reasonably cooperate with the other
party to, including providing the other party an opportunity to deliver any
statement, form or other documentation that would, reduce or eliminate any
such requirement to deduct or withhold. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid to a Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid, and the party
remitting such amounts to the Taxing Authority shall promptly furnish to the
other party the original or certified copy of a receipt or other reasonable
evidence issued by such Taxing Authority evidencing such payment.

satisfy the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or
application for or receipt of a waiver of such minimum funding requirements,

could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof neither any of the Companies

401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter
from the IRS or has applied to the IRS for such a letter within the applicable
remedial amendment period or such period has not expired. To the Sellers'
knowledge, nothing has occurred since the date of the latest favorable
determination letter or opinion letter, as applicable, that would reasonably
be expected to materially adversely affect the qualification of any such
Employee Benefit Plan.

terms and Applicable Law. All contributions or premiums with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan have been paid or deducted in a timely fashion and there
is no outstanding default or violations thereunder that have not been properly
recorded in the financial statements as underfunded. Other than routine claims
for benefits, there are no suits, claims, proceedings, actions, governmental
audits or investigations that are pending or, to the Sellers' knowledge,
threatened against or involving any Company Benefit Plan or asserting any
rights to or claims for benefits under any Company Benefit Plan except for
such Legal Proceedings that have not had and could not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(f) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan covered by Subtitle B, Part 4 of
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, no non-exempt prohibited
transaction has occurred that has caused or would reasonably be expected to
cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any material liability
under ERISA or the Code. There is no litigation, arbitration or administrative
proceeding concerning any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claim for
benefits) that would have or would reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Business Employee as at the date of this Agreement or that has employed a UK

"Relevant Employer") has complied with its automatic enrollment obligations as
required by the United Kingdom Pensions Act 2008 and Applicable Laws
associated legislation and (i) no notices, fines or other sanctions have been
issued by the United Kingdom Pensions Regulator in respect of the Companies
and (ii) no instances of non-compliance with the automatic enrolment
obligations of the Companies have been notified in writing to the United

Employment) Regulations 1981 or 2006 apply where the UK Business Employees had
the right to membership of an occupational pension arrangement that provided

No contribution notice or financial support direction has been issued by the
United Kingdom Pensions Regulator under sections 38 or 43 of the United
Kingdom Pensions Act 2004 respectively against any of the Companies and there

Company Benefit Plan, or (iv) give rise to any payments or benefits that would
be subject to tax under Section 4999 of the Code or would be nondeductible to
the payor under Section 280G of the Code. Neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
event) will constitute a "change in ownership or control" or "change in
effective control" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

Closing Date nor (2) except as provided under Section 5.07(c)(ii) above,
manufacture or produce, or cause or permit any third party to manufacture or
produce, any new materials incorporating any Licensed Marks in any manner.

any RB Marks.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that this Agreement
does not, and shall not, convey, transfer or assign any right, title or
interest in any trademark, name or logo of any third party.

(a) To the extent available on the Sellers' docketing or other internal
systems, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
Buyer a list of all actions that must be taken by Buyer within ninety (90)
days following the Closing Date with respect to each item of Registered IP
Rights for the purposes of continuing the prosecution of, maintaining,
perfecting or renewing any such Registered IP Rights; provided that with
respect to any such actions that must be taken no later than thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide such list as soon as practicable after the date hereof.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Sellers
shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, cooperate with the
Buyer (at the Buyer's expense) in preparing, obtaining and filing all
documents (including assignment and name change forms) with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office or other corresponding Governmental Authority, as
necessary to record one of the Companies as, or correct the record such that
one of the Companies is, the sole legal and record owner of the Intellectual
Property Rights listed in Section 5.07(g)(i) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule and any other Intellectual Property Rights which the parties
reasonably identify as having similar issues, including as necessary to change
the record owner's name or otherwise correct the chain of title in respect of
any such Intellectual Property Rights, provided, however, that in the event
that the parties are not able to prepare, obtain or file any such documents
prior to the Closing Date, the parties will continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to do so as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable release and
termination of the Lien set forth in Section 5.07(g)(ii) of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule with respect to the Intellectual Property Rights listed on
Section 5.07(g)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedules, and record such
releases in the United States Patent and Trademark Office; provided however
that in the event that the Sellers are not able to obtain such release and
termination of such Lien prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers will continue
to use commercially reasonable efforts to do so as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter,
the Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered
to Buyer documentation containing information that is currently used in the
development, production, packaging, marketing or distribution of the products
of the Business to the extent such documentation is in the possession of a
Seller or any of Sellers' Affiliates but not in the possession of the
Companies (including recipes, formulae and specifications for packaging), to
the extent such delivery does not violate any obligations of Sellers owed to
any third party.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall cooperate with the Buyer to deliver to Buyer all prosecution files and
dockets, registration certificates and litigation files to the extent relating
to the Registered IP Rights, in each case, solely to the extent such materials
are in the possession of the Sellers and not already in the possession of the
Companies.

(e) Effective from and after the Closing, Sellers hereby grant, and agree to
cause their applicable Affiliates to grant, to the Companies a non-exclusive,
worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-
transferable (other than in connection with the sale of all or a substantial
portion of any of the Companies or their businesses), non-sublicensable (other
than in connection with products and services of the Business and natural
extensions thereof) license, under the Intellectual Property Rights owned by
Sellers or any of Sellers' Affiliates as of the Closing (other than Trademarks
and domain names) that are used by any Seller or any of Sellers' Affiliates
(including the Companies) in the Business (including as such business evolved
until the Closing Date) as of the Closing Date, to use, reproduce, create
derivative works of, modify, distribute, make, have made, sell, offer for
sale, import or otherwise commercially exploit products and services (and
related promotional materials) solely in connection with the continued
operation of the Business as conducted as of the Closing Date (and any natural
extensions thereof).

Section 5.08. Public Announcements. No party shall, without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), issue any press release or make any other
public announcement relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, except to the extent required by Applicable Law or any
regulatory or supervisory body or the rules of any securities exchange to
which the disclosing party is subject. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 5.08, in no event will any of Buyer, any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates publicly announce or disclose the financial terms of the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) unless required by either party or its Affiliates to comply with
Applicable Law or any regulatory or supervisory body or the rules of any
securities exchange to which the disclosing party is subject. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer may make public statements with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including their effect on Buyer's
business and its financial projections, with investors, analysts and Financing
Sources, including, without limitation, on its periodic earnings calls and in
any Syndication and Offering Materials, so long as Buyer's statements are not
inconsistent with the press releases or other disclosure previously issued and
agreed upon by the parties.

Section 5.09. Intercompany Matters. Effective as of the Closing, except for
the Transition Services Agreement or the Contribution Agreement, except as
contemplated by this Agreement and except for those arrangements set forth on
Section 5.09 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, all intercompany accounts
between the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Company, on the other hand, shall be settled and paid in full (regardless of
the terms of payment of such intercompany accounts), and all agreements and
obligations between the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand,
and any Company, on the other hand, shall be terminated, in each case without
further liability or obligation (contingent or otherwise) of any party
thereunder. As of the Closing, any rights granted to any Seller or any
Affiliate of a Seller to use (a) Company Intellectual Property Rights or (b)
any Intellectual Property Rights assigned to Buyer pursuant to Section
5.07(g), in each case of clause (a) and clause (b) shall immediately
terminate.

Section 5.10. Directors and Officers. From and after the Closing and for a
period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, Buyer shall not permit the
Companies to repeal, amend or modify the rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, exculpation and other limitations on liability in a
manner adverse to any current or former director or officer of each Company
(including any predecessors thereof) (collectively, such Representatives, the
"Sellers Indemnitees") under, and such Persons shall continue to be entitled
to such rights on terms no less favorable than those contained in the
organizational documents of any Company in effect on the date of this
Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

(a) In the event that Buyer, any Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns (1) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (1) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and
assets to any Person, then in each such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Buyer, any such Company, as the case may
be, shall succeed to and be bound by the obligations set forth in this Section
5.10.

(b) The obligations of Buyer under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to materially and adversely affect any Sellers
Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.10 applies without the written consent of
such affected Sellers Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that each Sellers
Indemnitee shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.10).

Section 5.11. Assignment of Contracts and Rights. As promptly as practicable
but subject to the terms of this Section 5.11, Parent and the Sellers shall,
and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to assign in whole all the Assigned Contracts to one of the Companies
and assign in part (to the extent relating to the Business) the Shared
Contracts to one of the Companies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any
Shared Contract, any Assigned Contract or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if such assignment, without the
consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach of or default
under such Shared Contract or such Assigned Contract or in any material way
adversely affect the rights of any Seller, any Company or any of their
respective Affiliates thereunder. With respect to any Shared Contract or any
Assigned Contract, from and after the date hereof, the Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of
their progress, to obtain any required consent for the assignment (in whole or
in part, as applicable), transfer or sublicense of such Shared Contract or of
such Assigned Contract to Buyer. Promptly following any such consent being
obtained, Parent or the Sellers shall assign and transfer, or sublicense, to
Buyer such Shared Contract or such Assigned Contract for no additional
consideration. If such consent is not obtained, Parent, the Sellers and Buyer
will, for a period of six (6) months following the Closing, cooperate in a
mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and
assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including
subcontracting, sublicensing, or subleasing to Buyer, or under which the
applicable Seller or Parent would enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer
assuming the applicable Seller's or Parent's obligations, any and all rights
of the applicable Seller or Parent against a third party thereto. In
connection with any Shared Contract or any Assigned Contract that is (x)
assigned, in whole or in part, to Buyer, any Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or (y) subcontracted, sublicensed or subleased or
under which the applicable Seller, Parent or any of its Affiliates otherwise
passes along any benefits thereunder, in each case whether whole or in part,
to Buyer, any Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Buyer hereby
agrees to perform, and to cause to be performed, all of its or such Company's
or Subsidiary's (as applicable) obligations thereunder and shall promptly but
in any event within 15 Business Days of being invoiced therefor, reimburse the
applicable Seller or Parent for any and all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
such Seller, Parent or any of its Affiliates under any such Shared Contract or
under any such Assigned Contract.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (1) neither
the Sellers, Buyer nor any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries
shall be required to expend money, incur any liability, commence any
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third party to obtain any such consent to assign a Shared Contract or an
Assigned Contract, (1) the assignment of any Shared Contract or any Assigned
Contract shall not be a condition to the obligation of the parties hereto to
consummate this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (1) in no event shall Buyer
be entitled to assert that a failure to obtain any consent to assign a Shared
Contract or an Assigned Contract, or any breach or non-performance by Sellers
or Parent of this Section 5.11, shall have given rise to a failure of the
condition set forth in Section 8.01(b)(ii).

Section 5.12. Covered Lease Matters. Buyer acknowledges that prior to the date
of this Agreement, Tiger's Milk Seller assigned to its Affiliate, The French's
Food Company LLC, the Springfield Lease. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer
will (a) if so requested, provide a replacement guarantee for the benefit of
the landlord with respect to such Covered Leases, and (b) will cause each of
the Companies that is a tenant under the Covered Leases to, use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a full release of Tiger's
Milk Seller and its Affiliates from the landlord under the Covered Leases, if
and to the extent that Tiger's Milk Seller and/or its Affiliates retain any
liability with respect to the Covered Leases from and after the Closing Date;
provided, however, other than expressly contemplated in this Section 5.12,
Buyer shall not be required to expend money, incur any liability (except as
tenant under the Covered Leases after the Closing and pursuant to any
replacement guarantee for the benefit of the landlord with respect to such
Covered Leases), commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any such release. Until
such time as Tiger's Milk Seller and its Affiliates no longer have obligations
under (including as guarantor) the Covered Leases, (i) Buyer hereby
indemnifies, and shall cause the Springfield Tenant and the Chester Tenant to
indemnify, Tiger's Milk Seller, Parent and their respective Affiliates against
and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages actually
suffered by Tiger's Milk Seller, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates
arising out of the Covered Leases after the Closing Date, including any breach
after the Closing Date of any covenant or agreement or indemnity made or to be
performed by the Springfield Tenant or the Chester Tenant under such lease and
(ii) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Springfield Tenant and the Chester
Tenant to, promptly notify Tiger's Milk Seller of receipt of any notice or
other communication from any Person alleging any indemnity claim or that a
default has occurred under the Covered Leases. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the covenants and agreements contained in this
Section 5.12 shall survive for the full period of all statutes of limitations
(giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

Section 5.13. Insurance Coverage. From and after the Closing, the Business
shall cease to be insured by the Sellers' and their Affiliates' insurance
policies or by any of their respective self-insurance programs, and each
Seller and its applicable Affiliate shall retain all rights to control such
insurance policies and self-insurance programs, including the right to
exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back or otherwise resolve disputes with
respect to any of its insurance policies and self-insurance programs.

(a) The parties acknowledge that the Companies and the Business may be
entitled to the benefit of coverage under the insurance policies of the
Sellers or their Affiliates (the "Retained Policies") with respect to acts,
facts, circumstances or omissions occurring prior to Closing ("Pre-Closing
Occurrences"), and, for a one-year period concluding on the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Sellers hereby authorize Buyer to report any and all
Pre-Closing Occurrences arising in connection with the Companies or the
Business (to the extent the Damages with respect to such Pre-Closing
Occurrences were not taken into account in connection with the Purchase Price
adjustment under Section 2.06) to the applicable insurance providers to the
extent permitted under the applicable Retained Policy, and where not
permitted, agrees, upon receipt of a written request by Buyer, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to make such report on Buyer's behalf.

(b) With respect to claims for Pre-Closing Occurrences made pursuant to
Section 5.13(b), (%4) if reported to the applicable insurance provider by
Buyer, Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers' corporate insurance department
of such claims, (%4) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, comply
with the terms of the applicable Retained Policy and (%4) each party shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the benefit of the applicable insurance coverage and pay such benefit,
if any, to Buyer (net of any Recovery Costs incurred by any Seller or any
Affiliate of a Seller as a result of the same); provided that (x) Buyer shall
be fully liable for all uninsured or self-insured amounts in respect of any
Retained Policy claims and (y) Buyer agrees to reimburse the Sellers promptly
upon request for all out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by any Seller or
any Affiliate of a Seller in connection with making or pursuing any claim
pursuant to this Section 5.13, including the costs of filing a claim and any
deductibles, premium increases, Taxes or other amounts that are or become
payable by any Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller as a result of claims made
pursuant to this Section 5.13 (such costs and expenses referred to in this
clause (y), "Recovery Costs"). The parties agree that any recoveries under the
Retained Policies pursuant to this Section 5.13 shall inure first to the
Sellers to reimburse any and all Recovery Costs.

Section 5.14. Domain Name Transfer. Promptly at or after the Closing, the
Sellers shall transfer, and cause their Affiliates to transfer, the ownership
of the Tiger's Milk Domain Names and French's Domain Names (together, the
"Assigned Domain Names") to Buyer (it being understood that (a) Buyer shall be
permitted to nominate any of its Affiliates to be the transferee of any of the
Assigned Domain Names, provided that the list of such nominated Affiliates is
provided to the Sellers prior to the Closing, and (b) Buyer shall ensure that
the transfer of any Assigned Domain Names to such nominated Affiliates is in
accordance with any Applicable Law including any regulations of the applicable
domain name registrar). The Sellers shall take reasonable actions and execute
and deliver documents that Buyer may reasonably request to effect the
foregoing.

Section 5.15. Other Transfers. Prior to or reasonably promptly after the
Closing, the Sellers shall have transferred (or caused to be transferred) to
Buyer or the Companies or their Subsidiaries all of the Sellers' and their
Affiliates' right, title and interest in and to the assets exclusively used in
(or, solely with respect to intent-to-use Trademark applications, exclusively
related to) the Business (including as such business evolved until the Closing
Date), including as set forth on Section 5.15 of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule and take reasonable actions and execute and deliver documents that
Buyer may reasonably request to effect the foregoing.

Section 5.16. Financing Cooperation. (a) Subject in all respects to Section
5.16(d) and Section 5.16(f), the Sellers and each of the Companies shall, and
shall cause each of their respective representatives (including their

it or they become aware of such error, mistake, omission or failure for the
Required Permanent Financing Information to be Compliant, and if requested by
Buyer, will use reasonable best efforts to promptly correct such error,
mistake or omission, or make such Required Permanent Financing Information
Compliant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither

(i) would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of
the Sellers, the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates;

(ii) would require the Sellers, any of the Companies or any Persons who are
officers or directors of the foregoing to pass resolutions or consents to
approve or authorize the execution of the Financing;

(iv) would require the Sellers, any of the Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any

until the Closing Date;

(v) could reasonably be expected to cause the Sellers, any of the Companies or
any of their respective Affiliates or any director, officer or employee or

(c) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable
to arrange and obtain the Bridge Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letter, in each case to the extent obtaining the
Bridge Financing is necessary for Buyer to consummate the Financing Purposes,
including using reasonable best efforts to, (i) at or prior to Closing,
satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, or obtain a waiver of, all conditions to
funding applicable to Buyer in the Commitment Letter that are within its
control, (ii) at or prior to Closing, negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Commitment Letter (the "Debt Documents") or on other terms that are no
less favorable to Buyer than those contained in the Commitment Letter
(including any "flex" provisions contemplated by the related fee letter),
(iii) comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letter to the extent
the failure to comply with such obligations would adversely impact the timing
of the Closing or the availability at Closing of sufficient aggregate proceeds
of the Bridge Financing to consummate the Financing Purposes, and (iv) if the
conditions to the Bridge Financing have been satisfied, consummate the Bridge
Financing at or prior to (or substantially contemporaneously with) Closing.
Buyer shall give the Sellers prompt written notice (A) if and when Buyer
becomes aware of any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or other Debt Document, as
applicable, to the extent such breach, default, termination or repudiation
could reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing or
otherwise result in sufficient proceeds of the Bridge Financing to consummate
the Financing Purposes not being available at the Closing, (B) if and when
Buyer becomes aware that all or any portion of the Bridge Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter will not be available and all or such
portion of the Bridge Financing is necessary to consummate the Financing
Purposes, (C) promptly following (and in any event within 3 Business Days
following) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication,
in each case, from a Financing Source, alleging any material dispute or
disagreement between or among Buyer, on the one hand, and any Financing
Sources, on the other hand (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing or
Debt Documents), with respect to the obligation to fund the Bridge Financing
or the amount of the Bridge Financing to be funded at Closing, in each case to
the extent such dispute or disagreement could reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the Closing or otherwise result in sufficient
proceeds of the Bridge Financing necessary to consummate the Financing
Purposes not being available at the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing,
Buyer shall keep the Sellers reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of the material developments concerning the status of its
efforts to arrange the Bridge Financing and provide to the Sellers, upon their
reasonable request, copies of executed copies of the material definitive
documents related to the Bridge Financing, if any (subject to any limitation
on disclosure or any confidentiality provision set forth therein). If any
portion of the Bridge Financing becomes or could reasonably be expected to
become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment
Letter (including any "flex" provisions related thereto) and such portion is
necessary to consummate the Financing Purposes, Buyer shall use reasonable
best efforts to arrange to obtain in replacement thereof alternative
financing, including from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when
added to the portion of the Bridge Financing that is available and any cash of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries on hand at the Closing Date, to consummate the
Financing Purposes ("Alternative Financing") as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event; provided that Buyer shall not be
obligated to seek or obtain Alternative Financing on terms and conditions
materially less favorable to Buyer in the aggregate than the Bridge Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter. The provisions of this Section 5.16
shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the purposes of
this Agreement, all references to the Bridge Financing shall be deemed to
include such Alternative Financing and all references to the Commitment Letter
or other Debt Document shall include the applicable documents for the
Alternative Financing. Buyer shall not permit, without the prior written
consent of the Sellers, any material amendment or modification to be made to,
or any termination, rescission or withdrawal by Buyer of, or any material
waiver by Buyer of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter that
could reasonably be expected to (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Bridge
Financing under the Commitment Letter to an aggregate amount less than the
amount necessary for the representation in Section 4.05(d) to be true on the
Closing Date (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount thereof (except as set forth in any "flex" provisions
contemplated by the fee letter included in the Commitment Letter)), or (y)
impose any new or additional condition, or otherwise amend, modify or expand
any condition to the receipt of any portion of the Bridge Financing, in each
case in a manner that would (I) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (II)
make the funding of any portion of the Bridge Financing necessary to
consummate the Financing Purposes (or satisfaction of any condition to
obtaining any portion of the Bridge Financing) less likely to occur, it being
understood and agreed that, in any event, Buyer may amend the Commitment
Letter to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar
entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement and consent to the assignment after the date of this Agreement of
lending commitments under the Commitment Letter to other lenders, or otherwise
result in sufficient proceeds of the Bridge Financing necessary to consummate
the Financing Purposes not being available at the Closing or (III) adversely
impact the ability of the Buyer to enforce its rights against any other party
to any Debt Document. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, compliance with this Section 5.16 shall not relieve Buyer of its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether or not the Financing or Alternative Financing is available.

(d) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers, each of the Companies
and their respective Affiliates and each of their respective directors,
officers or employees or stockholders from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees), interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred in connection with any action taken, or cooperation provided, by such
Person or any of its representatives pursuant to this Section 5.16 or the
provision of information utilized in connection therewith, in each case to the
extent taken or provided at the request of Buyer or pursuant to this Section
5.16 (other than arising from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or
Actual Fraud on the part of the Sellers or any Company). Buyer shall promptly
upon request by the Sellers, reimburse the Sellers for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred
by the Sellers, any of the Companies or their respective Affiliates in
connection with the Financing or Alternative Financing, including the
cooperation of the Sellers, the Companies and their respective Affiliates
contemplated by this Section 5.16.

performance by the Sellers or breach by the Sellers of their respective
obligations under this Section 5.16 (in each case other than non-compliance or

Subsidiary (a "Parent DC Plan"), Buyer shall (or cause one of its Affiliates
to), effective as of the Applicable Transfer Date, cover such Transferred
Employee under a defined contribution plan that is intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code and that is sponsored by Buyer or one of its

Employees and former employees who had rendered services primarily associated
with the Business; provided, however, that if Applicable Law does not permit
Buyer or its Affiliates to provide such benefits with respect to injuries or
illnesses that arose prior to the Applicable Transfer Date, French's Seller

Bonuses on (or promptly following) the 2017 Bonus Payment Date and %3. without

2017 Bonus Payment Date, then, such employee shall be entitled to receive
payment of his or her 2017 Bonus as of the 2017 Bonus Payment Date; provided

the Companies shall be permitted to establish annual bonus opportunities for
Business Employees for the 2018 fiscal year under the Bonus Plans, in the
ordinary course of business consistent with business strategy objectives and

or implied, %3. is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (including any
Business Employee) other than the parties hereto, any right, benefit or remedy

establish, or constitute an amendment, termination or modification of, or an

will not cause or permit any Company or any Affiliate of Buyer (1) to take any
action on the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business,
including the distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any
redemption that could give rise to any Tax liability or reduce any Tax Asset
of any Seller or Seller Group or give rise to any loss of any Seller or any
Seller Group under this Agreement, (1) to make or change any Tax election

consistent with its past practices, prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed (1) all Tax Returns in respect of the Companies that do
not include any Post-Closing Tax Period and (1) all Tax Returns that relate to
Combined Taxes and, except as otherwise provided below, timely pay Taxes shown
as due and payable on any such Tax Return (each a "Seller Prepared Tax
Return"). If Buyer (or, after the Closing, any Affiliate of Buyer, including
any Company) is required by Applicable Laws to file any of the Tax Returns
described in clause (A) of the foregoing sentence, (I) Seller shall deliver
such Tax Returns to Buyer for its review and comment at least thirty (30)
Business Days prior to the applicable filing deadline (taking into account any
extensions thereof), and Sellers (or, as applicable) their Affiliates shall in
good faith (x) consider Buyer's reasonable comments and (y) cooperate with
Buyer to resolve any disagreements with respect to such Tax Returns prior to
the required due date for filing such Tax Returns and (II) subject to Buyer's
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), Buyer shall file or cause to be filed the final version of any such
Tax Returns. With respect to any Tax Return prepared by the Sellers that Buyer
is required to file or cause to be filed under this paragraph (i), no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for filing each such Tax
Return, the Sellers shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to, pay to Buyer in
cash (or, at Buyer's request, to the applicable Taxing Authority if permitted
by Applicable Law) an amount equal to the Sellers Indemnified Taxes shown as
due and payable with respect to such Tax Return, except to the extent such
Taxes have already been included in the calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital or have been otherwise paid by the Sellers to Buyer under Section
7.04.

(ii) Except as set forth in Section 7.01(b)(i), Buyer shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns in respect of the
Companies. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared all such Tax Returns
that relate to a Straddle Period ("Straddle Period Returns") in a manner
consistent with the past practices of the Sellers, their Affiliates and the
Companies unless a different treatment of any item is required by Applicable
Law. Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers (A) a draft of each Straddle Period
Return and (B) a pro forma return for the Pre-Closing Tax Period included in
such Straddle Period Return (which may be in the form of a schedule or similar
set of calculations substantially to the same effect) (a "Pro Forma Pre-
Closing Period Return") for review by the Sellers and their Affiliates no
later than 30 days prior to the due date for the filing of such Straddle
Period Return (taking into account extensions), and Buyer shall cooperate in
good faith with the Sellers or their designee to resolve any disagreements
with respect to such Straddle Period Return or Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period
Return prior to the required due date for filing such Straddle Period Return.
No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for filing each
such Straddle Period Return, the Sellers shall, or shall cause one or more of
their Affiliates to, pay to Buyer in cash (or, at Buyer's request, to the
applicable Taxing Authority if permitted by Applicable Law) an amount equal to
the Sellers Indemnified Taxes shown as due and payable on the Pro Forma Pre-
Closing Period Return with respect to such Straddle Period Return, except to
the extent such Taxes have already been included in the calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital or have been otherwise paid by Sellers to Buyer under
Section 7.04. To the extent a Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period Return shows any
refund attributable to any Taxes (including estimated Tax payments) paid prior
to the Closing Date by any Company or any member of any Seller Group with
respect to the Straddle Period to which such Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period
Return relates, Buyer shall, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to,
pay to Sellers in cash an amount equal to the amount of such refund.

(iii) If the parties are unable to resolve all open issues with respect to any
Straddle Period Return and/or Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period Return, such open
issues shall be referred to an Auditor (as defined in Section 2.06(c)) no
later than fifteen days prior to the due date for filing such Straddle Period
Return and the fees and expenses of the Auditor in connection therewith shall
be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other
hand. If the Auditor resolves such open issues prior to the required due date
for filing of such Straddle Period Return, such Straddle Period Return shall
be prepared and filed, and the Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period Return adjusted,
in a manner consistent with any resolution by the Auditor. If the Auditor does
not resolve such open issues prior to the due date for filing of such Tax
Return, then (A) such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer, (B) for
purposes of the final sentence of Section 7.01(b)(ii), the amount of Sellers
Indemnified Taxes or credits or refunds with respect thereto shall be
determined based on the Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period Return with respect to
the Straddle Period Return as so filed and (C) upon the resolution of such
open issues by the Auditor after the filing of such Straddle Period Return, if
the Auditor has determined that the Straddle Period Return was filed
incorrectly and/or the Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period Return prepared by Buyer
was incorrect, (x) Buyer shall pay to the Sellers or an Affiliate thereof
designated by the Sellers in cash an amount equal to the excess Taxes, if any,
paid by the Sellers and their Affiliates with respect to the Pro Forma Pre-
Closing Period Return with respect to such Straddle Period Return and (y)
Buyer shall pay to the Sellers or an Affiliate thereof designated by the
Sellers in cash an amount equal to the additional credit or refund, if any, to
the extent attributable to any Taxes (including estimated Tax payments) paid
prior to the Closing Date by any Company or any member of the Seller Group
with respect to the Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period Return with respect to such
Straddle Period Return in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y) based on and
taking into account such determination and no later than five (5) Business
Days after the Auditor has made its determination described in this sentence;
provided that, in lieu of Buyer's payment obligations set forth in this
sentence and the Sellers' payment obligations set forth in the final sentence
of Section 7.01(b)(ii), with respect to any such Tax Return, if Buyer so
elects the Sellers shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to, pay to Buyer in
cash within five Business Days after the Auditor has made its determination
described in this sentence the amount equal to the Sellers Indemnified Taxes
shown as due and payable on the Pro-Forma Pre-Closing Period Return with
respect to such Straddle Period Return based on and taking into account such
determination. If Buyer does not file an amended Straddle Period Return that
reflects such determination, the parties agree that, as between them, their
respective rights and obligations under this Agreement (including indemnity
obligations) with respect to such Straddle Period Return shall take into
account such determination.

(iv) The Sellers shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to, include the
Companies in any Tax Return for Combined Taxes through the close of business
on the Closing Date, including for Combined Taxes with respect to any United
States state or local jurisdiction and the United Kingdom.

(c) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers or an
Affiliate thereof designated by the Sellers all refunds of Taxes (or credits
attributable to estimated Tax payments) and interest thereon received by
Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, or any Company to the extent attributable to
Taxes (including estimated Tax payments) paid by the Sellers (or any
predecessor or Affiliate of the Sellers) or any of the Companies with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or, in the case of estimated Tax payments, the
portion of any Straddle Period that includes the relevant Pre-Closing Tax
Period). If, in lieu of receiving any such refund, any Company reduces a Tax
liability with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period by offsetting such Tax
liability by the amount of the refund to which it otherwise would have been
entitled, Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers or an
Affiliate thereof designated by the Sellers the amount of such reduction in
Tax liability, which such reduction, for the avoidance of doubt, shall take
into account any interest accrued under Applicable Law in respect of such
refund; provided that the Sellers shall furnish to Buyer a statement as to the
amount of any interest described in this sentence which statement shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
have no obligation to pay to the Sellers any such refunds or amounts to the
extent (i) reflected in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital or (ii)
of any amounts paid by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in respect of Taxes of
any Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than amounts reflected in the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital) for which Sellers have not paid
Buyer pursuant to Section 7.01(b) or Section 7.04 or do not have any remaining
indemnity obligation under this Agreement. This paragraph shall not be
construed to require the Sellers to make available any Tax Returns (or any
other information relating to Taxes) to Buyer.

(d)

(i) If any Seller Prepared Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends
on the Closing Date reflects a net operating loss or other Tax item that may
be carried back to reduce U.S. federal or state or Canadian income Taxes or
U.K. corporation Taxes for a prior Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer agrees to
cooperate with Sellers in the preparation and filing of any carryback refund
claim or amended Tax Return with respect thereto permitted by Applicable Law,
and, to the extent received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any Company
with respect thereto, any refund of Taxes shall be paid over to Sellers as
provided in, and subject to the limitations of, Section 7.01(c).

(ii) If any Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period Return in respect of a Straddle
Period Return of French's UK or French's Canada, if and to the extent
applicable, reflects a net operating loss or other similar Tax item, then

(A) to the extent that such net operating loss or other similar Tax item
results in a reduction in the Tax liability shown as due on the Straddle
Period Return to which such Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period Return relates, upon
the filing of such Straddle Period Return Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount
equal to such reduction in Tax liability; and

(B) if such Straddle Period Return reflects a net operating loss or other
similar Tax item for such Straddle Period, Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers
in the preparation and filing, at Sellers' expense, of a carryback refund
claim or amended return with respect thereto to the extent permitted under
Applicable Law and, to the extent received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or
any Company, any refund of Taxes with respect thereto shall be paid over to
Sellers as provided in, and subject to the limitations of, Section 7.01(c);
provided that, if the amount of such net operating loss or other similar Tax
item reflected on such Straddle Period Return and so carried back exceeds the
amount of the net operating loss or other similar Tax item reflected on the
Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period Return with respect to such Straddle Period
Return, the amount payable by Buyer pursuant to this clause (B) shall not
exceed the amount of such refund of Taxes that would have been received had
the net operating loss or other similar Tax item reflected on such Straddle
Period Return been equal to the amount of such net operating loss or other
similar Tax item reflected on the Pro Forma Pre-Closing Period Return.

(e) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any real property
transfer Tax and any similar Tax) shall be paid by Buyer when due, and Buyer
shall, at its own expense, prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns with
respect to all such Taxes. If required by Applicable Law, the Sellers will,
and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns.

(f) Buyer shall cause (i) all of the interests in French's US that are
purchased pursuant to this Agreement to be purchased by a single purchaser
that is a domestic corporation (within the meaning of Section 7701(a) of the
Code), (ii) both French's US and such purchaser to be members of an affiliated
group (as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code) as of the close of the
business on the Closing Date, and (iii) such affiliated group to file a
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for a period that includes the day
immediately following the Closing Date, as a result of which Buyer and Sellers
agree and intend that for U.S. federal income tax purposes the Closing Date
shall constitute the end of a taxable period of French's US.

Section 7.02. Tax Sharing. Any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements between
any Company, on one hand, and any member of any Seller Group, on the other
hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date none of the
Companies, the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers shall have any further
rights or liabilities thereunder. From and after the Closing Date, this
Agreement shall be the sole Tax Sharing Agreement relating to the Companies
for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

Section 7.03. Cooperation on Tax Matters.

(a) Buyer and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
(including, in the case of Buyer, the Companies after the Closing Date) to,
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return, any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return,
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Buyer and the Sellers agree, and agree to
cause their respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Buyer, the
Companies after the Closing Date) to (1) retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies until the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority for all periods required by
such Taxing Authority and (1) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
the other party with at least 30 days' prior written notice before destroying
any such books and records, during which period the party receiving the notice
can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and records.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not be required to transfer
to Buyer any books, records or information to the extent they relate to
Combined Taxes; provided, however, that the Sellers shall provide Buyer with
information requested by Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.03(a) adequate to
substantiate the separate calculation of any Company's taxable income used in
determining Combined Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 7.03(a) shall require Sellers to give their consent to any of the
actions or failures to act for which Section 7.01(a) expressly requires such
consent.

(b) Buyer and the Sellers further agree, and agree to cause their respective
Affiliates (including, in the case of Buyer, the Companies after the Closing
Date), to, upon request, use all reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any governmental authority or customer of any Company
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

Section 7.04. Tax Indemnification.

(a) The Sellers agree to jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
each Buyer Tax Indemnified Party against any Sellers Indemnified Tax Loss;
provided that the Sellers and their Affiliates shall have no liability for the
payment of any Sellers Indemnified Tax Loss (%4) attributable to or resulting
from any action described in Section 7.01(a); (%4) for which Buyer is
otherwise required to indemnify the Sellers under Section 7.04(b); and (%4) to
the extent that such Sellers Indemnified Tax Loss is reflected in the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital (each of (i), (ii) and (iii)), a
"Sellers Indemnified Tax Loss Limitation").

(b) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Sellers Tax Indemnified
Party against any Buyer Indemnified Tax Loss.

(c) Section 9.06 and Section 9.07 shall apply to any indemnification payment
made under this Section 7.04 by the party making the indemnification payment
(the "Tax Indemnifying Party") to the party receiving such payment (the "Tax
Indemnified Party"), mutatis mutandis.

(d) For purposes of this Section 7.04, in the case of any Taxes (other than
Transfer Taxes) that are payable in respect of a Straddle Period, the portion
of such Tax related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (1) in the case of any
Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or
related to income, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period and (1) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross receipts, sales or use
Tax, shall equal the portion of such Tax that would have been payable if the
relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth in the foregoing clause
(ii) shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
Companies.

(e)

(i) The Tax Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice to the Tax
Indemnifying Party of any Indemnified Tax Loss or the assertion of any claim,
or the commencement of any audit, suit, action or proceeding (a "Tax
Proceeding") in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (specifying
with reasonable particularity the basis therefor) and will give the Tax
Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto as the Tax
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party.

(ii) The Tax Indemnifying Party may, at its own expense, (1) participate in or
assume the defense of any Tax Proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder; provided that the parties shall jointly control the conduct
of any Tax Proceeding that relates to both Pre- and Post-Closing Tax Periods,
and (1) with respect to any Tax Proceeding that relates either (1) to Combined
Taxes or (1) solely to one or more Pre-Closing Tax Periods, where a Seller is
the Tax Indemnifying Party, or solely to Post-Closing Tax Periods, where Buyer
is the Tax Indemnifying Party, assume the sole defense of such Tax Proceeding;
provided that (x) the Tax Indemnifying Party shall thereafter consult with the
Tax Indemnified Party upon the Tax Indemnified Party's reasonable request for
such consultation from time to time with respect to such Tax Proceeding and
(y) the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Tax Indemnified Party's
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, agree to any settlement with respect to any Tax if such settlement
would adversely affect the Tax liability of the Tax Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates.

(iii) The Tax Indemnified Party shall have the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the defense of any Tax Proceeding, other than any Tax
Proceeding the Tax Indemnifying Party assumes the sole defense thereof under
paragraph (ii) above, and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by the Tax Indemnifying Party. The Tax Indemnified Party
shall not settle any Tax Proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder without the consent of the Tax Indemnifying Party, unless the
Tax Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense. Whether or not the
Tax Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all of the
parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. The Tax
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Section 7.04 with respect to
any Tax resulting from a claim or demand it was not notified of or the defense
of which the Tax Indemnifying Party was not offered the opportunity to assume
as provided under this Section 7.04(e) to the extent the Tax Indemnifying
Party's liability under this Section 7.04 is adversely affected as a result
thereof.

(f) Any claim of any Buyer Tax Indemnified Party under this Section 7.04 may
be made and enforced by Buyer on behalf of such Buyer Tax Indemnified Party
and any claim of any Sellers Tax Indemnified Party may be enforced by any
Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller on behalf of such Sellers Tax Indemnified
Party.

Section 7.05. UK VAT Group and Group Tax Arrangements.

(a) Prior to Closing, the Sellers shall as soon as reasonably practicable
notify HMRC that, from the date of the Closing, French's UK will not qualify
to be treated as a member of the VAT Group, and will request that HMRC exclude
French's UK from the VAT Group from the end of the Closing Date, and shall
cooperate and take all reasonable steps with the Buyer to procure that, with
effect from the day immediately following the Closing Date, French's UK shall
be added to the McCormick (UK) Limited VAT Group. Promptly after notification
by HMRC, the Sellers shall inform the Buyer of the date (the "Exit Date") from
which the Company shall be removed from the group registration of the VAT
Group.

(b) Within ten (10) Business Days of the end of the prescribed accounting
period (as defined by section 25(1) of VATA for the VAT Group containing the
Exit Date or of any prescribed accounting period ending after the Closing but
before the Exit Date, Buyer shall procure that there is provided to the
Sellers any information relating to French's UK that is reasonably required by
Reckitt Benckiser Corporate Services Limited (registered in England with
number 4027682, whose registered office is at 103-105 Bath Road, Slough,
Berkshire, SL1 3UK, UK, being the representative member of the VAT Group) in
order to complete the VAT return for that period.

(c) The Sellers shall, within ten (10) Business Days of a request by the
Buyer, provide all reasonable information and assistance to the representative
member of the McCormick (UK) Limited VAT Group to enable it to complete the
VAT return due for the prescribed accounting period in which the Exit Date
occurs.

(d) The Sellers shall procure that any other Group Tax Arrangement to which
French's UK is party shall terminate, or shall cease to have effect with
respect to French's UK, from the end of the Closing Date. This Section 7.05(d)
shall be without prejudice to (A) Section 7.05(e) and Section 7.05(f) below
and (B) the rights and obligations accruing under any such agreements or
arrangements prior to such termination or cessation.

(e) For any Tax period, whether it ends before, on or after the Closing for
which French's UK is part of a Group Tax Arrangement, the Sellers shall
procure that a Seller (or an Affiliate of a Seller) shall pay to French's UK
or (as appropriate) the Buyer shall procure that the Company shall pay to the
appropriate Seller (or Affiliate of a Seller)

(i) in respect of any Tax to which the Group Tax Arrangement relates the
amount that is reflected in respect of the Tax in the calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital or otherwise fairly attributable to French's UK, such
payment to be made on Closing or, if later, the date falling five (5) Business
Days before the latest date on which that Tax is due and payable to the
appropriate Taxing Authority; and

(ii) in respect of any Relief to which the Group Tax Arrangement relates the
amount that is reflected in respect of the Relief in the calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital or otherwise fairly attributable to French's UK,
such payment to be made on Closing or, if later, within fifteen (15) Business
Days of receipt of the relevant Relief.

(f) Section 7.05(e) does not apply to the extent that such amount has
otherwise been paid on or before Closing, or would (if paid) give rise to a
claim under Section 7.04.

Section 7.06. Purchase Price Adjustment. Any amount paid by the Sellers or
Buyer under Article 7 or Article 9 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for income tax purposes to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law.

Section 7.07. Survival. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the covenants and agreements contained in this Article 7 shall
survive for sixty (60) days following the full period of all statutes of
limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

ARTICLE 2 
SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 2.01. Survival. The representations and warranties of the parties
hereto contained in this Agreement shall not survive the Closing and there
shall be no liability in respect thereof, whether such liability has accrued
prior to, at or after the Closing, on the part of any party, its Affiliates,
and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners,
members, advisors or other Representatives; provided that the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 3.01(a) (solely the first sentence
thereof), 3.02, 3.03, 3.06, 3.08, and 3.21 (the "Sellers Fundamental
Warranties"), 4.01, 4.02, 4.08 and 4.09 (the "Buyer Fundamental Warranties"
and together with the Sellers Fundamental Warranties, the "Fundamental
Warranties") shall survive for the full period of all statutes of limitations
(giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). The covenants
and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement, or in any
certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection

Date, except for those covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be
performed in whole or in part at or after the Closing, which covenants shall
survive in accordance with their terms; provided that the covenants set forth
in Section 5.07, Section 5.12 and Section 5.16 shall survive for the full
period of all statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation
or extension thereof). Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any breach of
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentence if notice of the
inaccuracy thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been
given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such
time.

Section 2.02. Indemnification. Effective at and after the Closing, the Sellers
hereby, jointly and severally, indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates (including the
Companies) and its and their directors, officers and employees against, and
agree to defend and hold each of them (without duplication of Damages)
harmless from, any and all Damages suffered by any one of them (without
duplication of Damages) arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of any
Sellers Fundamental Warranty (each such misrepresentation and breach of
warranty, a "Sellers Warranty Breach") or breach of covenant or agreement made
or to be performed by the Sellers or Parent pursuant to this Agreement
("Sellers Covenant Breach", collectively the "Sellers Breaches"); provided
that Damages subject to the indemnification under this Section 9.02(a) shall
not include any amount that constitutes a Sellers Indemnified Tax Loss or an
amount which would constitute a Sellers Indemnified Tax Loss were it not for
the application of a Sellers Indemnified Tax Loss Limitation as described in
Section 7.04(a).

(a) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies the Sellers,
their Affiliates and their directors, officers and employees against, and
agrees to hold each of them (without duplication of Damages) harmless from,
any and all Damages suffered by any one of them (without duplication of
Damages) arising out of any (1) misrepresentation or breach of any Buyer
Fundamental Warranty (each such misrepresentation and breach of warranty, a
"Buyer Warranty Breach") or (1) breach of covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement ("Buyer Covenant Breach",
collectively, the "Buyer Breaches"); provided that Damages subject to
indemnification under this Section 9.02(b) shall not include any amount that
constitutes a Buyer Indemnified Tax Loss.

(b) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies the Sellers
and their Affiliates against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any
and all Damages actually suffered by a Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller
arising out of any and all Assumed Liabilities.

(c) Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.02 shall be subject to the
procedures and limitations set forth in Sections 9.03, 9.04, 9.05, 9.06 and
9.07.

Section 2.03. Limitations of Liabilities.

(a) With respect to indemnification by the Sellers for (i) Sellers Warranty
Breaches pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i), the aggregate liability of the
Sellers shall not exceed the Purchase Price and (ii) Sellers Covenant Breaches
pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(ii) and Sellers Indemnified Tax Losses pursuant to
Section 7.04(a), the aggregate liability of the Sellers shall not exceed the
sum of (A) 25% of the Purchase Price and (B) $20,000,000.

(b) With respect to indemnification by Buyer for Buyer Warranty Breaches
pursuant to Section 9.02(b)(i), the aggregate liability of Buyer shall not

9.02(b)(ii) and Buyer Indemnified Tax Losses pursuant to Section 7.04(b), the
aggregate liability of Buyer shall not exceed 25% of the Purchase Price.

Section 2.04. Third Party Claim Procedures. The party seeking indemnification
under Section 9.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice in
writing to the party against whom indemnity is to be sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action
or proceeding by any third party ("Third Party Claim") in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail such Third Party Claim, the basis for indemnification and
the amount of all related Damages (taking into account the information then
available to the Indemnified Party, including any limitations made in good
faith to preserve the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any
other privilege). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 9.04, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel
for such defense of any Third Party Claim in the event that (i) such Third
Party Claim seeks injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party, any of its Affiliates or any of their Representatives, (ii) such Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Legal
Proceedings and (iii) such Third Party Claim has been brought by or behalf of
any other customer, employee, supplier, vendor, service provider or
distributor of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including the Companies or any
Governmental Authority.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.04, (1)
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the
settlement does not expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party,
its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers and employees
from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or
the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, any of its Affiliates or its and their respective
directors, officers and employees and (1) the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ
separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party.

(c) The Indemnified Party shall not admit liability in respect of any Third
Party Claim, nor enter into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to
be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Section 2.05. Direct Claim Procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party has a
claim for indemnity under Section 9.02 against an Indemnifying Party that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt
notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail such claim, the basis for indemnification and
the amount of all related Damages (taking into account the information then
available to the Indemnified Party, including any limitations made in good
faith to preserve the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any
other privilege). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
Following such notice, the parties shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the notice described in this Section 9.05,
such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of
jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 11.11.

Section 2.06. Calculation of Damages. The amount of any Damages payable under
Section 9.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies, or
from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor (net of any expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such recovery, including any
Recovery Costs) and reduction in Taxes actually realized by the person that
incurred the Damages, as a result of the Tax items arising from the incurrence
or payment of any such Damages, such reduction to be determined on a "with and
without basis." If such reduction in Taxes is realized or the Indemnified
Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any
other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, in either case,
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with
providing such indemnification payment up to, as applicable, the amount of
such reduction in Taxes or the amount received by the Indemnified Party (net
of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in collecting such amount,
including any Recovery Costs).

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 9.02 (1) for any
Damages relating to any matter to the extent that such matter has been taken
into account in connection with the Purchase Price adjustment under Section
2.06 or (1) if there is included in the Financial Statements a specific
liability or reserve relating to such matter.

(b) Each Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates
to, use reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages for which such Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement; provided that neither the
Indemnified Party nor any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall
be required to incur any out-of-pocket expenses to third parties, commence any
Legal Proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise)
to any third party to mitigate.

(c) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts
available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 9.02.

Section 2.07. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 9.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of
such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the
underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

Section 2.08. No Right to Set-Off.

(a) Each of Buyer on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates (including after Closing, the
Companies), hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights of set-
off, netting, offset, recoupment or similar rights that such party and its
Affiliates has or may have with respect to the payment of the Purchase Price
or any other payments to be made by such party, as applicable, pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement.

(b) In this connection, each party hereto hereby agrees, on behalf of itself
and all of its Affiliates, that in no event shall any Indemnified Party be
entitled to indemnification hereunder in respect of any claim, item or other
matter unless and until such claim, item or other matter has been Finally
Determined; provided, however, that in the case of an assessment of Tax by a
Taxing Authority against French's Canada for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, the
Sellers shall upon notice by a Buyer Tax Indemnified Party pay to the Buyer
Tax Indemnified Party the amount of Tax then due and owing under the ITA (or
under the corresponding provision of provincial or territorial legislation),
notwithstanding the fact that the Sellers Indemnified Tax Loss has not been
Finally Determined.

Section 2.09. Release.

(a) Effective as of the Closing (but only if the Closing actually occurs),
except for any rights or obligations of parties under this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements, Buyer, on behalf of itself and each of its
Subsidiaries (including the Companies) and each of its and their respective

Parties may have against each of the Seller Released Parties, now or in the
future, in each case in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating to the
Companies, the Business or any actions taken or failed to be taken by any of
the Seller Released Parties in any capacity related to Companies or the
Business occurring or arising prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Effective as of the Closing (but only if the Closing actually occurs),
except for any rights or obligations of parties under this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements, each of Parent and the Sellers, on behalf of
itself and each of its Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective past,
present and/or future officers, directors, employees, agents, general or
limited partners, managers, management companies, members, advisors
stockholders, equity holders, controlling Persons, other representatives or

limited partners, managers, management companies, members, advisors

duties, debts, dues, accounts, bonds, Contracts and covenants (whether express
or implied), and claims and demands whatsoever whether in law or in equity
(whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) which the Seller Releasing
Parties may have against each of the Buyer Released Parties, now or in the
future, in each case in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating to the
Companies, the Business or any actions taken or failed to be taken by any of
the Buyer Released Parties in any capacity related to Companies or the
Business occurring or arising prior to the Closing Date.

Section 2.10. Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, except (a) as
expressly provided in Section 5.10, Section 5.12, Section 5.13, Section 5.16,
Section 6.07, Section 6.16, Section 7.04, Section 11.13 and Section 11.15 and
(b) for claims arising out of Actual Fraud or Willful Breach, this Article 9
will provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, covenant or other agreement or other claims arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than claims with
respect to the determination of the Adjustment Amount, which shall be resolved
in accordance with Section 2.06).

ARTICLE 3 
TERMINATION

Section 3.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(i) by mutual written agreement of the Sellers and Buyer;

(ii) by either the Sellers or Buyer if Closing has not occurred on or before
5:00 pm (New York City time) on January 18, 2018 (the "End Date"); provided
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.01(a)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision
of this Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to have occurred by
such time; provided, however, that if as of such time all of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.01 (other than the condition set forth in Section
8.01(a)(i), Section 8.01(a)(ii) and those conditions to be satisfied by the
delivery of documents or taking of any other action at the Closing by any
party) have been satisfied, then either Buyer or the Sellers (so long as such
party is not then in material breach of the Agreement) may extend the End Date
until 5:00 pm (New York City time) on April 18, 2018 by delivery of written
notice of such extension to the other party not less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the initial End Date;

(iii) by either the Sellers or Buyer if the Closing would violate any non-
appealable final Order of any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction;

(iv) by Buyer if there is any material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement,
such that (A) the conditions specified in Section 8.01(b)(i) or Section
8.01(b)(ii) would not be satisfied at the Closing (a "Terminating Sellers
Breach"), (B) the Terminating Sellers Breach cannot be cured or has not been
cured by the Sellers by the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Sellers of notice from Buyer of such breach or (y) the End Date and (C)
such Terminating Sellers Breach has not been waived by Buyer; or

(v) by the Sellers if (1) there is any material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement, such that (1) the conditions specified in Section 8.01(c)(i) or
Section 8.01(c)(ii) would not be satisfied at the Closing (a "Terminating
Buyer Breach"), (2) the Terminating Buyer Breach cannot be cured or has not
been cured by Buyer by the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days after receipt by
Buyer of notice from the Sellers of such breach or (y) the End Date and (3)
such Terminating Buyer Breach has not been waived by Sellers or (1) (1) all of
the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01(a) and 8.01(b) have been and
continue to be satisfied (other than (x) those conditions which by their terms
or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and which are reasonably capable
of being satisfied at the Closing and (y) those conditions the failure of
which to be satisfied is caused by or results from a breach by Buyer of this
Agreement) as of the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section
2.03, (2) Buyer has failed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement within three (3) Business Days following the date on which the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.03 and (3) each Seller has
certified to Buyer in writing that it is prepared to consummate the Closing
subject only to Buyer's concurrent consummation thereof.

(b) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.01(a)(ii), 10.01(a)(iii), 10.01(a)(iv) or pursuant to 10.01(a)(v) shall
give written notice of such termination to the other party.

Section 3.02. Effect of Termination. Subject to Section 10.02(b), if this
Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 10.01, such termination shall
be without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or Representative of such party) to the other
parties to this Agreement; provided that nothing shall relieve any party from
liability for any Willful Breach of this Agreement. The provisions of Section
1.01, Section 5.08, Section 5.16(d) and this Section 10.02 and Article 11
(other than Section 11.02) shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated (%4) pursuant to Section
10.01(a)(iii) (solely in respect of an injunction or Order in respect of
antitrust matters contemplated by Section 5.03), (%4) Section 10.01(a)(v)(A)
(due to Buyer's breach of Section 5.03 in respect of antitrust matters), or
(iii) pursuant to Section 10.01(a)(ii) and at the time of such termination,
all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(a) (other than (x) the
condition set forth in Section 8.01(a)(i) and (y) the condition set forth in
Section 8.01(a)(ii) solely in respect of an injunction or Order in respect of
antitrust matters contemplated by Section 5.03) and Section 8.01(b) have been
satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur on
the date of such termination), then Buyer shall pay to French's Seller (or an
Affiliate designated by French's Seller) a termination fee of $210,000,000 in
cash (the "Reverse Termination Fee") as a condition precedent to any such
termination by Buyer or otherwise within one Business Day of the date on which
this Agreement is terminated by any Seller(s).

(b) Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 10.02(b) are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, the Sellers would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Buyer fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to
Section 10.02(b), Buyer shall also pay any costs, fees and expenses incurred
by any Seller and its Affiliates (including reasonable and documented legal
fees and expenses) in connection with collecting such overdue amount,
including any Legal Proceeding to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment for such amount against Buyer. Any amount not paid when due pursuant
to this Section 10.02 shall also bear interest from the date such amount is
due until the date paid at a rate per annum equal to two (2)% per annum
compounded quarterly. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the
payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a
year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

(c) The parties agree and understand that in no event shall Buyer be required
to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of a Willful
Breach by Buyer, if the Sellers receive the Reverse Termination Fee from Buyer
pursuant to Section 10.02(b), such payment, together with any interest, costs,
fees or expenses payable pursuant to Section 10.02(c), shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Sellers against Buyer and its Affiliates and none of
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall have any further liability or
obligation (whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Companies or any Person that
is an Affiliate of the Companies relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Financing, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and none of the Companies nor any Person that is an Affiliate of
any of the Companies shall have any rights or claims against any Financing
Sources hereunder or thereunder.

date of receipt by the recipient thereof if received during Working Hours in
the place of receipt.



 Otherwise, any such notice, request or communication shall be deemed to have
been received on the next succeeding business day in the place of receipt.

Section 4.02. Sellers Disclosure Schedule. The Sellers have set forth
information on the Sellers Disclosure Schedule in a Section thereof that
corresponds to the numbered Section (or subpart thereof) of Article 3 of this
Agreement to which it relates. A matter corresponding to one section of
Article 3 of this Agreement and set forth in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
need not be set forth in any other Section of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
related to Article 3 of this Agreement so long as its relevance to such other
Section of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule related to Article 3 of this
Agreement or Section of Article 3 of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on
the face of the information disclosed therein to the Person to which such
disclosure is being made. The parties acknowledge and agree that (%4) the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule may include certain items and information solely
for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and (%4) the
disclosure by the Sellers of any matter in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by the Sellers that the
matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the
matter is material or outside the ordinary course of business.

Section 4.03. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; provided that no party may assign, delegate
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Buyer and
Sellers agree that Buyer shall be permitted to assign, without requiring any
further consent from Sellers, its rights under this Agreement (a) to La Cie
McCormick Canada Co. to purchase French's Canada and (b) to McCormick (UK)
Limited to purchase French's UK. Additionally, and notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, Buyer may, without the prior written consent of the Sellers, assign
its rights under this Agreement or any part hereof to one or more of its other
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that no such assignment under this sentence
shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder or expose any Seller to any
additional liability (including with respect to Tax) that such Seller would
not have incurred had Buyer, La Cie McCormick Canada Co. or McCormick (UK)
Limited been the assignee.

Section 4.04. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Annexes and
Schedules hereto) and the other Transaction Agreements, together with the
documents and certificates to be delivered in connection herewith and
therewith, constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 4.05. Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
is signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and the Sellers, or in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendments, modifications or waivers to the
provisions to which the Financing Sources are expressly made third party
beneficiaries pursuant to Section 11.08 shall be permitted in a manner adverse
to any Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Financing
Source.

(a) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall impair such right or remedy or operate or be
construed as a waiver or variation thereof or preclude its exercise at any
subsequent time, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right,
power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 9.08, the rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.

Section 4.06. Costs. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
party (including its Affiliates) incurring such cost or expense. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Sellers Transaction Expenses shall be paid directly by
the Sellers and no Company will pay any Sellers Transaction Expenses.

Section 4.07. Severability. Each term, provision, covenant and restriction of
this Agreement is severable. If any such term, provision, covenant or
restriction is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void
or unenforceable, subject to Section 5.06(c), it shall have no effect in that
respect and the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to replace it in that
respect with a valid and enforceable substitute term, provision, covenant or
restriction (as applicable), the effect of which is as close to its intended
effect as possible; and the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party.

Section 4.08. Third Party Rights. Except for Section 5.10, Section 7.04, and
Section 11.09 and as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any Person, other than
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided that
to the extent applicable to the Financing Sources, the Financing Sources shall
be third party beneficiaries of, and entitled to rely on, this Section 11.08,
Section 10.02(e), Section 11.05, Section 11.11, Section 11.12 and Section
11.14.

Section 4.09. Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege. Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to
cause the Companies to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest
arising out of or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the
"Post-Closing Representation"), of the Sellers, or any shareholder, officer,
employee or director of any Seller or Company (any such Person, a "Designated
Person") in any matter involving this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated thereby, including any litigation or other dispute
proceeding between or among Buyer or its Affiliates, any Company and any
Designated Person, by Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP as legal counsel to the
Sellers in connection with this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated thereby (the "Current Representation"), even though
the interests of such Designated Person may be directly adverse to Buyer or
its Affiliates or any Company.

(a) It is the intention of the parties hereto that all rights to any attorney-
client privilege applicable to communications between Davis Polk and Wardwell
LLP and the Designated Persons prior to the Closing in connection with the
Current Representation shall be retained solely by the Sellers; provided that
the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any
communication not involving this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated thereby. Accordingly, the Companies shall not have
access to any such communications, or to the files of Davis Polk and Wardwell
LLP in connection with the Current Representation, from and after the Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(1) the Sellers shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege
with respect to the Current Representation, and the Companies shall not be
holders thereof and (1) to the extent that files of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP
in connection with the Current Representation constitute property of a client,
only the Sellers shall hold such property rights.

(b) Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Companies), that in the event of a dispute
between any Sellers or an Affiliate of a Seller, on the one hand, and any
Company, on the other hand, arising out of or relating to any matter in which
Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP jointly represented in connection with the Current
Representation both (1) the Sellers and (1) any Company, if applicable,
neither the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence,
nor any right to any other evidentiary privilege or any work product doctrine
will protect against or prevent disclosure by Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP in
connection with the Current Representation to such Seller or an Affiliate of
such Seller of any information or documents developed or shared during the
course of any such joint representation.

(c) In the event that any third party shall seek to obtain from Buyer or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any Company) attorney-client
communications involving Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, then Buyer shall notify
the Sellers of such application sufficiently in advance of any hearing on the
application to permit the Sellers to participate in any such proceedings.

Section 4.01. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement and any Transaction
Agreements may be signed in any number of counterparts, and by each party on
separate counterparts. Each such counterpart shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement or any Transaction Agreement shall become effective
when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). Delivery of a counterpart of this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement by email attachment shall be an effective mode of delivery.

Section 4.02. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that, except as set forth
in Section 2.06, any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New
York State court sitting in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall
have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and
that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

Section 4.03. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such state. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement (including this Section 11.12), each party agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement or the Financing, in any forum other than
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom).

Section 4.04. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law, in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual
damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is
entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To
the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly
survives termination of this Agreement), the End Date shall automatically be
extended to (a) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of
such action, suit or proceeding or (b) such other time period established by
the court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding

Section 4.05. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

Section 4.06. Guarantee. Parent shall cause the Sellers to comply with their
obligations hereunder. In the event that any Seller fails in the due, punctual
and complete performance and payment (and not merely collection) in full of
all of its obligations and liabilities to Buyer under this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement to which a Seller is a party, as and when due and
payable or required to be performed pursuant to any provisions of this
Agreement or any Transaction Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof
(the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Parent shall irrevocably, absolutely and
unconditionally guarantee, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety,
the due and punctual payment and performance of such Guaranteed Obligations,
and if Seller shall default in the due and punctual performance of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations, Buyer shall be entitled to enforce directly against
Parent such Guaranteed Obligations.
