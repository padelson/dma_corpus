 (b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof:  

      | (i)  |   | Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per

to Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement, shall cease to be outstanding and shall

Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, $0.01 par value

Parent Common Stock, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of

---|---|---|--- 
   ##### 

    

      | (ii)  |   | Each share of Company Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and shares as to which appraisal
rights have been exercised pursuant to Section 3.1(e), shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be retired and cease to exist and be converted
automatically, subject to Section 3.2(d), into the right to receive that
Common Merger Consideration into which each such share of Company Preferred
Stock would have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) had such share
of Company Preferred Stock been converted (as contemplated by Section
6(d) of the Certificate of Designations) into shares of Company Common Stock
immediately before the Effective Time (the "Preferred Merger Consideration"
and, together with the Common Merger Consideration, the "Merger
Consideration").  
---|---|---|--- 
     
     | (iii)  |   | At the Effective Time, each Certificate
theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock or shares of
Company Preferred Stock (except as provided in Section 3.1(e) with respect
to shares of Company Preferred Stock as to which appraisal rights have been
exercised), as the case may be, shall, without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent or the holder thereof, represent, and shall be deemed to
represent from and after the Effective Time, the right to receive the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share)
as determined in accordance with Sections 3.1(b)(i) and 3.1(b)(ii) above and
shall cease to represent any rights in any shares of capital stock of the
Company or Surviving Corporation.  
  

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Stock._ By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, all of the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall in the aggregate be converted automatically into (i) a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common Stock") equal to the excess of 1,000 over the aggregate number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable, as of the Effective Time, pursuant to Section 7.13 of this Agreement, and (ii) such number of shares of Series A preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Series A Preferred Stock") (or fractions thereof) having a Liquidation Preference equal to $734,500,000.  

 (d) _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any stock split, combination of shares, or any dividend payable in stock shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock the same economic effect contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.  

 (e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding Section 3.1(b)(ii), shares of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Preferred Stock in accordance with the DGCL shall not be converted into the Preferred Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to   ##### 

    

perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal. If after the
Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his
right to appraisal, such shares of Company Preferred Stock shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the Preferred
Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Preferred
Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Payments to holders of Company
Preferred Stock under this Section 3.1(e) shall be made by the Company out of
its own funds, no funds shall be supplied for that purpose, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, nor shall Parent directly or indirectly reimburse the
Company for any such payments to holders of Company Preferred Stock.  

 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates._   

 (a) _Deposit with Exchange Agent_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company selected by Parent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.1(b).  

 (b) _Exchange and Payment Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (collectively, the "Certificates") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (collectively, "Company Securities") whose shares were converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the certificates to the Exchange Agent (and which shall be in such form as is reasonably satisfactory to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Following the Merger, the former holders of Company Securities shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a book-entry statement reflecting ownership of (or, if requested, a certificate representing) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock then held by such holder) into which the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock previously represented by such Certificates are converted in accordance with Section 3.1(b), and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.2(d). In the event that the Merger Consideration is to be delivered to any person who is not the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be delivered to a transferee if the Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate (other than a   ##### 

    

certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(a)) shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration contemplated by this
Section 3.2. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Certificates pursuant to provisions of this Article III.  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to Parent Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.2(d) until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of unclaimed property, escheat and other applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(d) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.  

 (d) _No Fractional Securities_. In lieu of any fractional securities, each holder of Company Securities who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of Certificates for exchange pursuant to this Article III will be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such holders respective proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Article III. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to former holders of Company Securities (such excess being collectively called the "Excess Parent Common Stock"). The Exchange Agent, as agent for the former holders of Company Securities, shall sell the Excess Parent Common Stock at the prevailing prices on Nasdaq (or on the principal exchange on which the Parent Common Stock is then traded or quoted). The sales of the Excess Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on Nasdaq (or such other exchange) through one or more member firms of Nasdaq (or such other exchange) and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sales of Excess Parent Common Stock. Until the net proceeds of such sales have been distributed to the former holders of Company Securities that were converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to former holders of Company Securities in lieu of any fractional interests in shares of Parent   ##### 

    

Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance with this
Agreement such amounts to such former holders.  

 (e) _Closing of Transfer Books_. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates (or a book-entry position) representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 3.1 and in this Section 3.2.  

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Agent_. Any certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) and not exchanged within one year after the Effective Time pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be returned by the Exchange Agent to Parent, which shall thereafter act as Exchange Agent. All funds or securities held by the Exchange Agent for payment to the holders of unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed at the end of two years from the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, after which time any holder of unsurrendered Certificates shall look as a general creditor only to Parent for payment of such funds or securities to which such holder may be due, subject to applicable law.  

 (g) _Escheat_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any person for any funds or securities delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  

 (h) _Lost Certificates._ In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.  

 (i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates which, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.  

 (j) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock_. All shares of Parent Common Stock shares paid upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of Articles I, II and III (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.2(d)) shall be deemed to have   ##### 

    

been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock.  

 Section 3.3 _Company Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plan._ (a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Option") granted under the employee and director stock plans of the Company, but excluding the ESPP (the "Stock Plans"), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Option") on the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as were applicable under such Company Option. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Option shall be the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, and such Parent Option shall have an exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in such Company Option divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that, in the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies immediately prior to the Effective Time by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.  

 (b) The Company shall take any actions with respect to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") as are necessary to provide that (i) participation in the ESPP shall be limited to those employees who were participants on the date hereof, (ii) such participants may not increase their payroll deduction election or purchase elections from those in effect on the date hereof, (iii) if the Effective Date is prior to June 30, 2003, the ESPP shall terminate upon the Effective Date and all balances in ESPP participant accounts shall be delivered to participants as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with the terms of the ESPP and (iv) if the Effective Date is on or after June 30, 2003, (A) purchases shall be made under the ESPP with respect to the ESPP purchase periods ending on June 30, 2003, provided, however, that if the date on which the Effective Time occurs is scheduled to be June 30, 2003, such purchase period(s) shall end on June 27, 2003, (B) any ESPP purchase periods scheduled to commence on July 1, 2003 shall be suspended pending consummation of the Merger, during which time no payroll deductions shall be made under the ESPP and (C) the ESPP shall terminate upon the date on which the Effective Time occurs.  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action for the adjustment of the Company Options under this Section 3.3. Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be subject to Parent Options as a result of the actions contemplated by this Section 3.3. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event not later than one Business Day following the Effective Time), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Options and, if applicable, with respect to the Companys 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and   ##### 

    

maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such Parent Options remain outstanding or,
if applicable, for so long as plan participation interests in the Companys
401(k) Retirement Savings Plan are required to be registered.  

 Section 3.4 _Company Warrants_. (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this Section 3.4, each Company Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall, at the Effective Time, be assumed by Parent and without further action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof be converted into a warrant to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Warrant"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the applicable warrant agreement in effect at the Effective Time, except that: (i) each Parent Warrant shall be exercisable for a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Warrant shall be equal to the per share exercise price specified in such Company Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest cent).  

 (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Section 3.4, with respect to any Company Warrant (i) that, in connection with a Reorganization (as defined in such Company Warrant), permits the Company at its election to make payment of a cash sum in exchange for such Company Warrant in lieu of exchanging such Company Warrant for consideration based on the consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock in such consolidation or merger and (ii) as to which Parent has given the Company written notice not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time of Parents desire for the Company to effect such exchange for cash, then the Company shall exchange, or shall cause to be exchanged, such Company Warrant for such cash amount as is specified in such Company Warrant to be exchanged therefor and the Company shall otherwise comply with all of the provisions of such Company Warrant relating to such exchange.  

 (c) The Company shall give all such notices as may be required by the terms of the Company Warrants in respect of the matters contemplated by Section 3.4(a) and Section 3.4(b) at the times and in the manner required by such Company Warrants.   #####

As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, any change or effect that is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to (i) the business, operations, results of operations or financial condition of such Party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of such Party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of any change or effect relating to or arising from the execution, announcement, or consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers or employees.

not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted.  

 Section 4.2 _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, of which, as of April 30, 2003, 22,910,267 shares were issued and outstanding, and 230,866 such shares were held in the Companys treasury; (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which (A) 6,885,715 shares are designated as Company Preferred Stock, of which, as of April 30, 2003, 5,996,677 shares were issued and outstanding and no such shares were held in the Companys treasury, and each of which, as of the date hereof, is convertible into 1.092259732 shares of Company Common Stock and (B) 1,000,000 are designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock"), of which no shares are issued and outstanding, and no such shares are held in the Companys treasury.

 Section 5.1 _Corporate Organization._ Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Parents "Significant Subsidiaries" (as defined in Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC) (the "Parent Significant Subsidiaries") is duly organized and validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Significant Subsidiaries has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.  

 Section 5.2 _Capitalization._ As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 1,600,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, 400,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Parent B Common Stock") and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Parent Preferred Stock").

This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies).

actual transactions.  

 (c) With respect to each Annual Report on Form 10-K and each Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q included in the Parent Reports filed since August 29, 2002 and prior to the date hereof, the financial statements and other financial information included in such reports fairly present (within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of Parent as of, and for, the periods presented in the Parent Reports.  

 Section 5.5 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) the filing of the pre-merger notification report under the HSR Act, (b) the filing with the SEC of (i) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (ii) a Registration Statement of Parent on Form S-4 with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock which may be issued to stockholders of the Company in the Merger, the Parent Options described in Section 3.3 and the Parent Warrants described in Section 3.4 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Parent Registration Statement") and (iii) such reports under the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (c) such filings and approvals as are required to be made or obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of various states in connection with the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, the Parent Options described in Section 3.3 and the Parent Warrants described in Section 3.4, (d) the filing of applications for the authorization of quotation on Nasdaq or such other national exchange on which the Parent Common Stock is quoted or listed at the Effective Time of the Parent Common Stock issuable under this Agreement, or pursuant to the exercise of the Parent Options described in Section 3.3 and the Parent Warrants described in Section 3.4, and such other filings as may be required under the rules and regulations of Nasdaq or other exchange, (e) the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the Company, (f) the approval of the Charter Amendment by the requisite vote of the holders of the Company Preferred Stock and of the holders of the Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock voting together, (g) the filings with any Governmental Entity as required under applicable law in each case as expressly set forth in Section 5.5 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (h) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the DGCL, (i) consents and approvals previously obtained, (j) such filings, consents and approvals in respect of the Company Permits (without giving effect to the materiality qualifier contained in the definition thereof) as are required by applicable law and (k) such other filings the failure of which to make would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, no consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any Governmental Entity or third party are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and delivery by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement and (B) the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof, to Parents knowledge, there is no reason, relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries, the operation of their businesses or the terms of this Agreement, why the receipt of any such consents or approvals will not be obtained in a customary time frame once complete and appropriate filings have been made by the Company and Parent.   #####

 Section 5.8 _Registration Statement._ None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time any Registration Statement becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading.

 Section 5.11 _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or is in default or violation of, any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective properties are bound or affected.

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above but subject to compliance with Section 7.3(c) and (d), (i) the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company may, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and the Charter Amendment Approval, (A) in response to an unsolicited bona fide written offer or proposal with respect to a potential or proposed Acquisition Transaction ("Acquisition Proposal") from a corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group (a "Potential Acquirer") which the Companys Board of Directors determines, in good faith (x) after consultation with its independent financial advisor, would reasonably be expected to result (if consummated pursuant   ##### 

    

to its terms and which consummation is reasonably possible) in an Acquisition
Transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the Merger (a
"Qualifying Proposal") and (y) after having received and considered the
advice of, and after consultation with, its independent, outside
legal counsel, the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under
applicable law, furnish confidential or non-public information to (provided
that the Company shall have received from the Potential Acquirer a
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as stringent in all
material respects as the Confidentiality Agreement), and negotiate with, such

payment to Parent of the fee pursuant to Section 9.2(b), enter into
agreements relating to, a Qualifying Proposal as to which the Companys Board
of Directors has determined in good faith (I) after consultation with its
independent financial advisor would result in an Acquisition Transaction more
favorable to the Companys stockholders than the Merger and is reasonably
capable of being financed and consummated and (II) after having received and
considered the advice of, and after consultation with, its independent,
outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would constitute a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under
applicable law (such Qualifying Proposal being a "Superior Proposal") and
(ii) the Companys Board of Directors may take and disclose to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or
otherwise make disclosure required by the federal securities laws or their
fiduciary duties, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Company. It is understood and agreed that negotiations and other
activities conducted in accordance with this paragraph (b) shall
not constitute a violation of paragraph (a) of this Section 7.3.  

 (c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent orally and in writing after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, substantive indication of interest or request for non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary by any person or entity that after the date hereof informs the Board of Directors of the Company or such Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall identify the offeror and indicate in reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such proposal, indication of interest or request. The Company shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day, keep Parent informed orally and in writing of any material changes or developments with respect to any activities or discussions relating to an Acquisition Proposal, including any significant change in the terms or status of such an Acquisition Proposal, indication of interest or request.  

 (d) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with any parties other than the Parties with respect to any of the foregoing; _provided, however_ , that neither the Company nor any of its affiliates shall waive any standstill or confidentiality provisions.

The Companys Board of Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of the Company the votes required by the DGCL and/or the Company Charter in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Charter Amendment and any other matters required thereby to be approved and shall recommend to the stockholders of the Company that they so vote at the Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof; _provided_ that the Companys Board of Directors shall not be required to use such reasonable best efforts to obtain the vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement, the Charter Amendment and such other matters or to make or continue to make such recommendation if such Board of Directors, after having received and considered the advice of, and after consultation with, its independent, outside legal counsel, has determined that the making of such reasonable best efforts to obtain the vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Charter Amendment and such other matters or making or continuing to make such recommendation would cause the members of the Companys Board of Directors to breach their fiduciary duties under applicable laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless this Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall be required to submit the Stockholder Proposals for approval by its stockholders at the Stockholder Meeting, whether with or without the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors.  

 Section 7.5 _Legal Conditions to the Merger._ (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities, (ii) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VIII, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (a) above or any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree to divest any assets or businesses of the Company or any of its affiliates or to in any way limit the ownership or operation of any business of the Company or its affiliates and (ii) neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to (x) divest or encumber any assets or corporations of Parent or the Company, respectively, or any of their respective affiliates (provided that in connection with the obtaining of the approval of any Governmental Entity of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its   ##### 

    

Subsidiaries to, agree to divest encumber, and to divest or encumber, any of
its or their assets or corporations at the request of Parent and
provided that such divestiture is conditioned upon consummation of the
Merger) or (y) enter into any agreements that in any way limit the ownership
or operation of any business of Parent or the Company, respectively, or any
of their respective affiliates.  

 (c) Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ that Parent or the Company can restrict access by the other Party to such documents that discuss the pricing or dollar value of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The Parties agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein.  

 (d) The Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish the other Parties with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries affiliates, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

 (e) The Company and Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly advise the other Parties upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.  

 Section 7.6 _Affiliates._ The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person, listed on Exhibit F hereto to deliver to Parent, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit G hereto, as applicable, providing that such person will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such "affiliate" in the Merger, other than as contemplated in such written agreement.

 Section 7.11 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance. _(a) Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for six years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers liability Insurance Policies maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable insurance company, the terms of which provide at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous in any material respect to the Companys directors and officers currently covered) with respect to matters or events occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent available; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or its affiliates be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Company (which amounts under current policies are set forth in Section 7.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule), whether expended over time or paid in a lump sum or otherwise, to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 7.11; and, _provided_ , _further_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain or to cause to be obtained a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters relating to their duties or actions in their capacity as such (or in such capacity in another   ##### 

    

corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at
the request of the Company) and existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including those matters relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted to be so
indemnified by the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary, as the case may
be, under applicable law. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume all rights of the Indemnified
Parties to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the
respective Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (true and
complete copies of which have been filed as exhibits to the Companys Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, in the case of the
Company, and otherwise have been made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof) as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provided to Parent prior to the
date hereof shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to comply with its obligations thereunder. Such rights shall not
be amended, or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required
by law. The right to indemnification conferred by this Section 7.11 shall
include the right to be advanced and paid by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise
participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided
that such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to Parent to repay such advanced expenses to the extent
required by law or the terms of the applicable indemnification provision.  

 (c) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary thereof, Parent shall cause (i) the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect to indemnification and to limitation of certain liabilities of directors and officers than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter and Bylaws of the Company and (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to contain the current provisions regarding indemnification of directors and officers which provisions in each case shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.  

 (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or the respective successors or assigns of each (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall ensure that proper provision shall be made so that such successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or the respective successors or assigns of each, as the use may be, shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 7.11.  

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its officers, directors or  

-40-     ##### 

    

employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this Section 7.11 is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims under such policies.  

 (f) The provisions of this Section 7.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.11 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 7.11 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 7.11 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.11). For the avoidance of doubt, any failure by the Surviving Corporation to pay any amounts under this Section 7.11 for any reason whatsoever (including that such entity has ceased to exist) shall entitle the Indemnified Parties to fulfillment by Parent of such obligations of the Surviving Corporation.  

 Section 7.12 _Reorganization_. Following the Effective Time, neither the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent nor any of their affiliates shall knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any commercially reasonable action or cause any commercially reasonable action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.  

 Section 7.13 _Share Issuance_. On the date immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to sell to the individuals listed in Exhibit H such number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock as is set forth opposite each such individuals name in Exhibit H, subject in each case to such individual continuing to be employed by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and provided that such individual has not theretofore taken any action that would constitute the grounds for termination for "Cause" pursuant to such individuals Employment Agreement.  

 Section 7.14 _Employee Matters_. (a) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under the provisions of all employment, bonus, consulting, termination, severance, change in control and indemnification agreements that have previously been disclosed to Parent between and among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former officer, director, consultant or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, provided that this provision shall not prevent the Surviving Corporation from amending, suspending or terminating any such agreements to the extent permitted by the respective terms of such agreement.  

 (b) For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time, the employees of the Company who are employed by the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time (the "Assumed Employees") and who remain employed with the Surviving Corporation during such period will be offered benefit plan participation and coverage (other than incentive   ##### 

    

plan participation and coverage) at levels that are reasonably comparable (or
better), on an aggregate basis, to those currently in effect under
the Company Benefit Plans.  

 (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause their respective employee benefit and compensation plans (including, without limitation, pension, profit-sharing, retirement, savings, 401(k), vacation, paid time-off, employee, retiree health and other employee financial welfare or other benefit plans) covering any of the Assumed Employees on or after the Effective Time to count service that has been recognized by the Company and its affiliates, without duplication of benefits, for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, but not benefit accrual, to the same extent such service was recognized under any similar Company Benefit Plans, provided that the foregoing shall not apply for newly established plans for which prior service is not taken into account. Parent and the Surviving Corporation will also cause all (i) waiting periods and (ii) pre-existing conditions and proof of insurability provisions, for all conditions that all Assumed Employees and their covered dependents have as of the Effective Time, under each plan that would otherwise be applicable to newly hired employees to be waived with respect to Assumed Employees to the same extent waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plans for the year in which the Merger occurs.  

 (d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will give Assumed Employees credit, for purposes of Parents and the Surviving Corporations vacation and/or other paid leave benefit programs, for such employees accrued and unpaid vacation and/or paid leave balance as of the Effective Time.  

 Section 7.15 _Registration Statement_. (a) If at any time prior to the date of the Stockholder Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, any event with respect to the Company, its officers and directors or any of its Subsidiaries shall occur which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to the Registration Statement, the Company shall notify Parent thereof by reference to this Section 7.15(a) and such event shall be so described. Any such amendment or supplement shall be filed as promptly as practicable with the SEC and, as and to the extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, and such amendment or supplement shall comply in all material respects with all applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.  

 (b) If at any time prior to the date of the Stockholder Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, any event with respect to Parent, its officers and directors or any of its Subsidiaries shall occur which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to the Registration Statement, Parent shall notify the Company thereof by reference to this Section 7.15(b) and such event shall be so described. Any such amendment or supplement shall be filed as promptly as practicable with the SEC and, as and to the extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, and such amendment or supplement shall comply in all material respects with all applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.   #####

The Company shall have received certificates signed on behalf of Parent by an appropriate executive officer to such effect.  

 (b) _Performance of Obligations._ Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by each of them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall have received certificates signed on behalf of Parent by an appropriate executive officer to such effect.   #####

ARTICLE IX  

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  

 Section 9.1 _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company:  

 (a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument;  

-45-     ##### 

    

 (b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  

 (c) by Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before the seven-month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "Termination Date"), unless the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such Party set forth herein; provided, however, that if on such date each of the conditions set forth in Article VIII other than those set forth in Section 8.1(a), Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(e) has been fulfilled or is capable of being fulfilled, then such date shall be automatically extended to the nine-month anniversary of the date of this Agreement;  

 (d) (i) by the Company (provided that the Company is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of its covenants or agreements or any of its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) of this Agreement, and which is not cured as promptly as practicable and in any case within thirty (30) days following written notice by the Company to Parent or by its nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date; or  

 (ii) by Parent (provided that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if (A) there shall have been a breach by the Company of any of its covenants or agreements or any of its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement, which breach, in any such case, either individually or in the aggregate, would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.3(a), 8.3(b) or 8.3(c) of this Agreement or (B) there shall have been a material breach (including any transfer or other disposition of any Company Securities in violation thereof) by any party to a Voting Agreement (other than Parent) of any of its respective covenants or agreements or any of its respective representations or warranties set forth in such Voting Agreement, and which, in the case of either of clause (A) or (B), is not cured as promptly as practicable and in any case within thirty (30) days following written notice by Parent to the Company or by its nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date;  

 (e) by the Company if, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and the Charter Amendment Approval, (A) the Company receives a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company shall have promptly (and in no event later than two calendar days, which shall include at least one Business Day, after forming such intention) notified Parent of its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e), such notice to Parent to be in writing and to be accompanied by full details of the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the offeror, a complete copy of each agreement contemplated to be entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Superior Proposal, and shall have otherwise complied with Section 7.3, (C) if requested by Parent within two Business   ##### 

    

Days after receipt by Parent in writing of such full details of the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall have negotiated
and caused its respective financial and legal advisers to negotiate during
the following five Business Day period with Parent to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to
proceed with the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms,
and notwithstanding such negotiations and adjustments, the Board of Directors
of the Company concludes, in its good faith judgment, that the
transactions contemplated herein on such terms as adjusted, are not at least
as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal and
(D) the Board of Directors of the Company thereafter resolves to accept such
Superior Proposal after having received and considered the advice of, and
after consultation with, its independent, outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable law; _provided_ ,
that such termination under this Section 9.1(e) shall not be effective until
the Company has made payment of the full fee required by Section 9.2(b)(i);
and _provided, further_ , that if Parents proposal under clause (C) is at
least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as the Superior
Proposal, this Agreement shall promptly be amended to reflect such terms and
the Company shall no longer have the right herein with respect to such
original Superior Proposal;  

 (f) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have failed to recommend, or shall have withdrawn, or modified or amended in any respect materially adverse to Parent, its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing, or shall have recommended another Acquisition Proposal or if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have resolved to accept a Superior Proposal or shall have failed to publicly affirm its approval or recommendation of this Agreement within 10 days of Parents request made after any Acquisition Proposal shall have been disclosed to the Companys stockholders generally; or  

 (g) by Parent or the Company, if the stockholders of the Company fail to approve this Agreement upon a vote held at a duly held meeting of stockholders called for such purpose (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), but subject, in the case of termination by the Company, to its obligation to make the payment required by Section 9.2(b), if applicable.  

 Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination._ (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 7.2(c), 10.2, 10.6, 10.7 and this Section 9.2 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement or out of intentional misconduct or fraud.  

 (b) The Company agrees to pay to Parent a fee equal to $25 million, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, if:   #####

     | (i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to

the termination date, or (B) the earlier of (x) the Company, directly
or indirectly, entering into a definitive agreement for an
Acquisition Transaction or (y) an Acquisition Transaction being
consummated;  
     
     | (iii) (A) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(c) at a time when Parent would have been permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii) as a result of a willful or
bad faith breach of any material covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, (B) prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal
(other than pursuant to this Agreement) shall have been disclosed publicly or
to the Company that contemplates a direct or indirect
consideration (implicit valuation) for the Company Securities (including the
value of any stub equity) in excess of the aggregate Merger Consideration and
(C) within 12 months following such termination, the Company, directly
or indirectly, enters into a definitive agreement for an
Acquisition Transaction or an Acquisition Transaction is consummated, which
fee shall be payable immediately upon either event described in this clause
(C), provided, that for purposes of this clause (C), the percentage in
the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" (including as such
definition relates to the definition of "Acquisition Proposal") shall
be thirty-three percent (33%) in lieu of twenty-five percent (25%)
or fifteen percent (15%), as the case may be; or  
     
     | (iv) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
9.1(g), provided that (A) at the time of the Stockholder Meeting an
Acquisition Proposal (other than pursuant to this Agreement) shall have
been disclosed publicly or to the Company and (B) within 12 months
of termination of this Agreement the Company, directly or indirectly,
enters into a definitive agreement for an Acquisition Transaction or

payable immediately upon either event described in this clause (B), and
provided, further, that for purposes of this Section 9.2(b)(iv) the
percentage in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" (including as such
definition relates to the definition of "Acquisition Proposal") shall
be thirty-three percent (33%) in lieu of twenty-five percent (25%)
or fifteen percent (15%), as the case may be.  
  

 (c) Subject to Section 9.2(a)(ii), each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that any termination fee payable pursuant to Section 9.2(b) of this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to any provision requiring the payment of such fee.  

 Section 9.3 _Amendment._ Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented at the Stockholder Meeting by the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after adoption   ##### 

    

of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, no amendment shall be made
which by law requires further approval of the stockholders of the
Company without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and the
Company.  

 Section 9.4 _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to the holders of Company Securities hereunder, other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 Section 10.4 _Interpretation._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this   ##### 

    

Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."  

 Section 10.5 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.  

 Section 10.6 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof other than the Confidentiality Agreement.  

 Section 10.7 _Governing Law._ (a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles.  

 (b) Each Party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action may be heard and determined in such Delaware state or federal court. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by law, that final and unappealable judgment against any of them in any action or proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.  

 (c) To the extent that any Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, each Party hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement.  

 (d) Each Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each Party certifies that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications set forth above in this Section 10.7.  

 Section 10.8 _Publicity._ The initial press release concerning the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby will be a joint release. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or the rules of Nasdaq, none of the Parties hereto shall, or shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not   ##### 

    

be unreasonably withheld (provided that the consent of Parent shall be deemed
to be the consent of Merger Sub). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, without the prior
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement
with respect to any material developments in the business strategy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, except for any such press release or public
announcement required by applicable law or the rules of Nasdaq (in which case
the Company shall, to the extent practicable, consult with Parent prior to
making such release or announcement).  

 Section 10.9 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 7.11 and 7.14, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.  

 Section 10.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached in any material respect. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. A Party is entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent any breach and to enforce terms or provisions if such breach would serve as a basis of terminating this Agreement by such Party. The rights provided by this section are in addition to any other remedy to which the Parties are entitled at law or in equity including an action seeking damages.   ##### 

    

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.        |   |   |   |
