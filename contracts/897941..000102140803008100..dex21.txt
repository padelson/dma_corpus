Agreement and Plan of Reorganization ("Agreement") is made and entered into
as of the 20/th/ day of May, 2003, by and among MAF Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Purchaser"), and St. Francis Capital Corporation, a Wisconsin
corporation (the "Company").   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the Boards
of Directors of Purchaser and the Company deem it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective shareholders that the Company be merged with
and into Purchaser (the "Merger") in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law ("DGCL"), the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law ("WBCL") and
this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser
and the Company have each approved the Merger upon the terms and conditions
set forth herein;   WHEREAS, immediately following the Merger, Purchaser and
the Company intend that St. Francis Bank, F.S.B., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company (the "Bank"), shall merge (the "Bank Merger") with and into
Mid America Bank, fsb, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser ("Mid
America"); and   WHEREAS, Purchaser and the Company intend the Merger to
qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code").   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:   I.   THE
MERGER   1.1 Effects of the Merger.   (a) Surviving Corporation. Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall be merged
with and into Purchaser at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.4
below) in accordance with the DGCL and the WBCL. As a result of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and the Purchaser
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation").   At the Effective Time, the effects of the Merger shall be
as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL and
WBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Purchaser and the Company shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
Purchaser and the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.     (b) Certificate of Incorporation. The
Certificate of Incorporation of Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and the
DGCL.   (c) By-laws. The By-laws of Purchaser in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until altered, amended or repealed as provided therein, or in accordance with
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the
DGCL.   (d) Directors and Officers. The directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the persons who were directors of Purchaser immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that certain members of the
Company\'s Board of Directors shall be appointed to the Board of Directors of
each of the Surviving Corporation and Mid America pursuant to Section 5.15.
The officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the persons who were
officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time.   1.2
Conversion of Securities. Subject to Section 1.5(d) regarding fractional
shares, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Purchaser Common
Stock (as defined below) or Company Common Stock (as defined below),
the following shall occur:   (a) Purchaser Common Stock. Each share of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser ("Purchaser Common
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding and shall be unchanged following the Merger.   (b)
Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 1.2(c) below, each share of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into the right to
receive 0.79 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Purchaser Common Stock (the value of which is referred to herein as the
"Merger Consideration").   (c) Stock Held by the Company or Purchaser. All
shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock
held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like
or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by
third parties) that are (i) owned by the Company as treasury stock, (ii)
owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries or (iii) owned directly or indirectly by Purchaser or any of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, shall be cancelled and shall constitute authorized
but unissued Company Common Stock and no shares of Purchaser Common Stock or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (d)
Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters. If subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, (a) the Company shall declare a
stock dividend or distribution upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or
combine the Company Common Stock, or declare a dividend or make
a distribution of Company Common Stock or any security convertible into
Company Common Stock, or (b) Purchaser shall declare a stock dividend or  
2    distribution upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine
Purchaser Common Stock or declare a dividend or make a distribution of
Purchaser Common Stock or any security convertible into Purchaser Common
Stock, an appropriate adjustment or adjustments shall be made to the Exchange
Ratio.   1.3 Stock Options. (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted
by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each an "Option,"
and collectively, "Options"), which is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, at the option of the holder
of such Option, be converted pursuant to either Section 1.3(a)(i) or (ii)
below:   (i) each Option held by a holder of an Option who, prior to the 
Effective Time, delivers an agreement in the form of Exhibit A-1 attached 
("Conversion Agreement"), shall be converted into an option to purchase 
shares of Purchaser Common Stock in such number and at such exercise price 
as set forth herein and otherwise having the same terms and conditions as  in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent  that
such terms, conditions and restrictions may be altered in accordance  with
their terms as a result of the Merger contemplated hereby or to the  extent
of any limited rights granted with respect thereto, which limited  rights
shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect): (x) the  number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be subject to the converted  Option shall
be equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company  Common Stock
subject to the original Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio; (y)  the exercise
price per share of Purchaser Common Stock under the converted  Option shall
be equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common  Stock under
the original Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; and (z)  upon exercise
of each Option by a holder thereof, the aggregate number of  shares of
Purchaser Common Stock deliverable upon such exercise shall be  rounded down,
if necessary, to the nearest whole share and the aggregate  exercise price
shall be rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest cent; or   (ii) each
Option not converted pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i)  above, shall be,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the  consent of Purchaser
(in its sole discretion), converted to the right to  receive cash; provided,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company delivered  to Purchaser a
cancellation agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit  A-2 hereto
("Cancellation Agreement"), executed by the holder of such  Option. All
Options converted pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(ii) shall  terminate
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. In  consideration of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall make or shall cause to be  made a cash payment to
the holder of each Option, at the time provided in  the final sentence of
this Section 1.3(a)(ii), in an amount (less any  applicable withholding
taxes) equal to the number of Company Common Stock  shares covered by such
Option multiplied by the amount which the Merger  Consideration exceeds the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock  under the Option held by
such holder. A holder of an Option who has  delivered a Cancellation
Agreement (x) prior to the Effective Time shall be  paid the amount to be
paid pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(ii) within three  (3) business days
following the Effective Time, and (y) after the Effective  Time shall be paid
the amount to be paid pursuant to this   3     Section 1.3(a)(ii) within
five (5) business days of Purchaser\'s receipt of  such Cancellation
Agreement.  The adjustments provided herein with respect to any Options
which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code)
shall be effected in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code.   (b) The Company shall amend each Company Stock Option
Plan (as defined herein) to provide for the conversion or cancellation of
Options in accordance with this Section 1.3. The Company shall also provide
to Purchaser the conversion option selected, pursuant to this Section 1.3, by
holders of the Options not less than five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Time. Such notice shall provide: (i) the name of the holder of such
Option; (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Option; (iii) the exercise price of such Option; and (iv) the method of
conversion selected by the holder of such Option. In the event the Company
fails to provide a conversion method for an Option pursuant to this Section
1.3, such Option shall be converted pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(ii).   (c)
Purchaser shall file, simultaneous with the Registration Statement (as
defined herein), with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
a registration statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") with respect to the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock subject to options to acquire Purchaser Common Stock
issued pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) hereof, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain the current status of the prospectus contained
therein, as well as comply with applicable state securities or "blue sky"
laws, for so long as such options remain outstanding.   1.4 Consummation of
the Merger; Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
consummated (the "Closing") at the offices of Vedder, Price, Kaufman
and Kammholz, 222 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois, on such date and
time as shall be fixed by mutual agreement of Purchaser and the Company as
promptly as practicable but not later than ten (10) business days (unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties, such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld) after all of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than the
receipt of closing certificates and legal opinions) have first been fulfilled
or waived; provided such conditions shall continue, on such tenth business
day, to be fulfilled or waived, including the conditions which, by their
terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date and/or at the Effective Time
(the date of such closing being, the "Closing Date"). At the Closing,
Purchaser and the Company shall cause the Merger to become effective by
causing a certificate of merger and an articles of merger substantially in
the forms set forth in Exhibit B (collectively, the "Certificate of Merger")
to be executed in accordance with the DGCL and WBCL and to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Secretary of State of the
State of Wisconsin. The time at which the Merger becomes effective shall be
referred to as the "Effective Time."   1.5 Exchange of Certificates.   (a)
Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited with Computershare Investor Services LLP (the "Exchange
Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of the Company Common
Stock, for exchange in   4    accordance with this Article I,
certificates representing the shares of Purchaser Common Stock and cash in
lieu of fractional shares.   (b) Surrender of Certificates. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than three (3)
business days following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver
to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which, as of the
Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each,
a "Certificate"): (i) a form letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or a lost certificate
affidavit and bond in a form reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent) to
the Exchange Agent; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The foregoing
letter of transmittal and instructions shall be subject to prior approval of
the Company. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent (or a lost certificate affidavit and bond in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Exchange Agent), together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive,
in exchange therefor, a certificate evidencing the number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common
Stock, theretofore represented by the Certificate so surrendered, shall have
been converted pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.2 (and, where
applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, also pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1.2) and the Certificate so surrendered shall be
cancelled. Purchaser shall direct the Exchange Agent to make such deliveries
within three (3) business days of the receipt of all required documentation.
If any Purchaser Common Stock to be exchanged for shares of Company Common
Stock is to be delivered in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered for exchange is registered, it shall be a condition to the
exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer, that all signatures shall be
guaranteed by a member firm of any national securities exchange in the United
States or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or by a
commercial bank or trust company or other financial institution acceptable to
Purchaser having an office in the United States, and that the person
requesting the payment shall either (a) pay to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or (b)
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes have been
paid or are not payable. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of any shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and any such
shares of Company Common Stock presented to the Exchange Agent shall be
cancelled in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect
thereto as provided in Section 1.2 above.   (c) Failure to Exchange Company
Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared after the
Effective Time with respect to Purchaser Common Stock payable to the holders
of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to Purchaser Common Stock represented
thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
holder until the holder of record shall surrender such Certificate. Subject
to the effect, if any, of applicable law, after the subsequent surrender and
exchange of a Certificate, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
any such dividends or distributions, without interest thereon, which
theretofore became payable with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock
represented by such Certificate. All dividends or   5    other
distributions declared on or after the Effective Time with respect to
the Purchaser Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof on or
after the Effective Time which are payable to the holder of a Certificate
not theretofore surrendered and exchanged for Purchaser Common Stock pursuant
to this Section 1.5(c) shall be paid or delivered by Purchaser to the
Exchange Agent, in trust, for the benefit of such holders. All such dividends
and distributions held by the Exchange Agent for payment or delivery to the
holders of unsurrendered Certificates unclaimed at the end of one (1) year
from the Effective Time shall be repaid or redelivered by the Exchange Agent
to Purchaser after which time any holder of Certificates who has not
theretofore surrendered such Certificates to the Exchange Agent, subject to
applicable law, shall look only to Purchaser for payment or delivery of such
dividends or distributions, as the case may be. Any shares of Purchaser
Common Stock or other consideration delivered or made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 1.5(c) and not exchanged for
Certificates within one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be returned
by the Exchange Agent to Purchaser which shall thereafter act as exchange
agent subject to the rights of holders of unsurrendered Certificates
hereunder.   (d) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender or exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of
Purchaser shall relate to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or assert any rights of
a stockholder of Purchaser. In lieu of any fractional share, Purchaser shall
cause to be paid to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Purchaser Common
Stock an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product achieved when
such fraction is multiplied by the closing price of Purchaser Common Stock on
The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") on the Closing Date.   (e) Escheat.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a former holder of
Company Common Stock for any consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable escheat or abandoned property laws.   (f) Withholding
Rights. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Purchaser
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Purchaser, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made by Purchaser.   (g) Stock Transfer Books. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company
Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by
law.   6     II.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER  
Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by Purchaser to the
Company prior to execution of this Agreement ("Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule"), Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company
that:   2.1 Organization.   (a) Purchaser is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware

operate and lease its assets, properties and businesses, and to carry on its
businesses substantially as they have been and are now being conducted.
Purchaser is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned or leased by it or
the nature of the business transacted by it requires that it be so qualified,
except where the failure to so qualify would not have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in Section 8.4) on the business of Purchaser and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Purchaser has all requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement, and, upon the approval of the
Governmental Authorities (as defined herein) and the stockholders of
Purchaser, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser is
duly registered as a unitary savings and loan holding company under the Home
Owners\' Loan Act, as amended ("HOLA").   (b) Mid America is a federally-
chartered stock savings bank duly organized and in existence under the laws
of the United States. Mid America is an "insured depository institution" as
defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDI Act") and applicable
regulations thereunder, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") through the Savings Association
Insurance Fund ("SAIF") to the full extent permitted under applicable
laws.   (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.1(c) to the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser has no direct or indirect
subsidiaries other than MAF Developments, Inc., N.W. Financial Corporation,
Mid America Investment Services, Inc., Mid America Finance Corporation, Mid

Disclosure Schedule, each of the Purchaser Corporate Subsidiaries is either
wholly-owned by Purchaser or Mid America or by wholly-owned subsidiaries of
Mid America, and is a duly organized and validly existing corporation or
limited liability company, as applicable, in good standing under the laws of
the State of Illinois, Delaware or Vermont, with corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its assets and properties and carry on
its business substantially as it has been and is now being conducted. Each
Purchaser Subsidiary holds all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises
and rights from all appropriate federal, state or other   7    public
authorities necessary for the conduct of its respective businesses, except
where the failure to so hold would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the
business of Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  
2.2 Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement,
the Certificate of Merger and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly approved and
authorized by Purchaser\'s Board of Directors, and all necessary corporate

charge with regard to such matters.   2.9 Litigation. (a) Except as set
forth on Schedule 2.7(b) to the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, there is no

performed   11    by Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary under any
contract, commitment, or other material obligation to which Purchaser, any
Purchaser Subsidiary or their respective properties is subject, and neither
Purchaser nor any Purchaser Subsidiary has waived any right under any
contract or commitment, except in each case where any such default or waiver,
singly or in the aggregate with any other such defaults or waivers, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. To the best knowledge of Purchaser, except as disclosed in
Purchaser Reports, no other party to any such material contract or commitment
is in default in any material obligation to be performed by such party.

or inaction, including taxes with respect to or based upon transactions or
events heretofore occurring, that are required to be reflected, disclosed or
reserved against in the audited consolidated financial statements in
accordance with GAAP ("Liabilities") have, in the case of Purchaser and the
Purchaser Subsidiaries, been so reflected, disclosed or reserved against in
the audited consolidated financial statements of Purchaser as of December 31,
2002 or in the notes thereto, and Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries

governmental registrations, licenses, permits or franchises (each a
"Purchaser Permit") required to be held by it and which are material with
respect to the operation of their respective businesses, except for such
Purchaser Permits which, the failure to hold, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.   2.14 Government Approvals. To Purchaser\'s best knowledge, no

amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Purchaser shall promptly inform the Company.   2.19

Effect on the Company or any Company Subsidiary, taken as a whole.   (b)
The policies, programs and practices of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary relating to wages, hours of work, and other terms and conditions
of employment are in compliance in all material respects with applicable

directors, employees or agents, in their capacities as such, in excess of
$100,000, or which would materially affect the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein or which is seeking to enjoin

which has had a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company

default, or the occurrence of an event which with notice or lapse of time or
both would constitute a default, in any obligation to be performed by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary under any contract, commitment, or other
material obligation to which the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their
respective properties is subject, and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has waived any right under any contract or commitment, except in
each case where any such default or waiver, singly or in the aggregate with
any other such defaults or waivers, would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the best
knowledge of the Company, no other party to any such material contract or
commitment is in default in any material obligation to be performed by
such party.   3.11 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as

Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole,

distributions with respect to shares of Company Common Stock or any
redemption, purchase or other acquisition of any of the securities of any
Company Subsidiary.   3.12 Undisclosed Liabilities. All of the obligations
or Liabilities have, in the case of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,

the Effective Time, taken all necessary action so that no
"business combination," "moratorium," "control share" or other state
antitakeover statute or regulation, nor any provision in the Company\'s
Articles of Incorporation, By-laws or Rights Agreement, would (i) prohibit or
restrict the Company\'s ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or the Certificate of Merger or its ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) have the effect of
invalidating or voiding this Agreement or the Certificate of Merger, or any
provision hereof or thereof, or (iii) subject Purchaser to any impediment or
condition in connection with the exercise of any of its rights under this
Agreement or the Certificate of Merger.   3.16 Proxy Statement/Registration
Statement Disclosure. None of the information to be supplied by the Company
for inclusion or to be incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement/Registration Statement or the information relating to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries in the Registration Statement, will, in the case
of the Proxy Statement or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at
the time of the meetings of Purchaser\'s and the Company\'s shareholders to
be held for purposes of approving the Merger, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading or, in the case of the Registration Statement, at the
time it becomes effective and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading. The portions of the
Proxy Statement relating to the Company which are incorporated by reference
to Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed by the Company under the Exchange Act
comply, and will comply, as to form in all material respects with
the provisions of the Exchange Act.   21     3.17 Taxes. (a) The
Company and each Company Subsidiary have each timely filed all tax and
information returns, including but not limited to all required Forms 1099,
1098 and 5498, required to be filed (all such returns being correct and
complete in all material respects) and have paid (or the Company has paid
on behalf of each Company Subsidiary), or have accrued on their respective
books and set up an adequate reserve for the payment of, all taxes, interest
and penalties required to be paid in respect of the periods covered by such
returns and have accrued on their respective books and set up an adequate
reserve for the payment of all income and other taxes anticipated to be

preceding the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
delinquent in the payment of any tax, assessment or governmental charge. No
deficiencies for any taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary that have not been resolved or settled
and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such tax are pending or
have been agreed to. Except as described in Schedule 3.17 to the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the income tax returns of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary have not been audited by either the Internal Revenue Service, or
any state or local taxing authorities, for any of the last ten years. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any action or proceeding
by any governmental authority for the assessment or the collection of taxes.
Deferred taxes of the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been accounted
for in accordance with GAAP. The Company and each Company Subsidiary have
delivered to Purchaser correct and complete copies of all federal and state
income tax returns and supporting schedules for all tax years since September
30, 1996. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been involved
in, or a party to, any transaction described in IRS Notice 2001-51. To the
best of the Company\'s knowledge, no event has occurred that could give rise
to a denial or recapture of any low income housing tax credits which are, or
were: (i) previously claimed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary; (ii)
projected to be claimed in future years by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary; or (iii) which are attributable to low income housing projects
upon which the Company or a Company Subsidiary has provided
financing (excepting only the loss of tax credit with respect to a single
unit located in the Thompson Meadows LLC tax credit project).   (b) The
Company has not filed any consolidated federal income tax return with an
"affiliated group" (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) where the

public deposit accounts of their obligations to file all forms, statements or
reports with it in accordance with applicable federal, state and local tax
laws and has taken reasonable steps to insure that such employees,  
22    shareholders and holders of public deposit accounts have filed all
such forms, statements and reports with it.   3.18 Insurance. The Company
and each Company Subsidiary maintain insurance with an insurer which in the
best judgment of management of the Company is sound and reputable, on their
respective assets, and upon their respective businesses and operations,
against loss or damage, risks, hazards and liabilities of the kinds
customarily insured against by prudent corporations engaged in the same
or similar businesses. The Company and each Company Subsidiary maintain in
effect all insurance required to be carried by law or by any agreement by
which they are bound. All material claims under all policies of insurance
maintained by the Company and the Bank have been filed in due and timely
fashion. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.18 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has had an insurance
policy cancelled by the issuer of the policy within the past five (5)
years.   3.19 Loans; Investments. (a) Each loan reflected as an asset on the
Company Financial Statements is evidenced by appropriate and sufficient
documentation in all material respects in accordance with customary lending
standards and constitutes, to the best knowledge of the Company, the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in
accordance with its terms except to the extent that the enforceability
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or equitable principles or doctrines. Except as disclosed on
Schedule 3.19 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, no obligor named therein is
seeking to avoid the enforceability of the terms of any loan under any such
laws or equitable principles or doctrines and no loan is subject to any
defense, offset or counterclaim. All such loans originated by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary and all such loans purchased by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, were made or purchased in accordance with customary
lending standards of the Company and any Company Subsidiary and in the
ordinary course of business of the Company and each Company Subsidiary. Set
forth on Schedule 3.19(a) to the Company Disclosure Schedule is a complete
list of the Company REO (as defined herein) as of April 30, 2003.   (b) All
guarantees of indebtedness owed to the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
including but not limited to those of the Federal Housing Administration, the
Small Business Administration, and other state and federal agencies, are

similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally or equitable principles or doctrines.   (c) In
originating, purchasing, underwriting, servicing, and discharging loans,
mortgages, land contracts, and contractual obligations relating thereto,
either for their own account or for the account of others, the Company and
each Company Subsidiary have complied in all material respects with all
applicable terms and conditions of such obligations and with all
applicable laws, regulations, rules, contractual requirements, and procedures
with respect to such servicing.   23     (d) Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.19(d) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the investments
reflected in the Company Financial Statements and none of the investments
made by the Company since September 30, 2002, is subject to any restriction,
whether contractual or statutory, which materially impairs the ability of the
Company freely to dispose of such investment at any time. With respect to all
material repurchase agreements to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party, the Company or such Company Subsidiary has a valid, perfected
first lien or security interest in the government securities or other
collateral securing each such repurchase agreement, and the value of
the collateral securing each such repurchase agreement equals or exceeds the
amount of the debt secured by such collateral under such agreement. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.19(d) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has sold or otherwise disposed of any
assets in a transaction in which the acquiror of such assets or other person
has the right, either conditionally or absolutely, to require the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to repurchase or otherwise reacquire any such assets.
Set forth on Schedule 3.19(d) to the Company Disclosure Schedule is a
complete and accurate list of each investment and debt security, mortgage-
backed and related securities, marketable equity securities and securities
purchased under agreements to resell owned by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, showing as of March 31, 2003, the carrying values and estimated
fair values of investment and debt securities, the gross carrying value and
estimated fair value of the mortgage-backed and related securities and the
cost and estimated fair value of the marketable equity securities.   (e)

Government agencies and corporations, obligations of States of the
United States and their political subdivisions, and other investment
securities classified as "held to maturity," "available for sale" and
"trading" held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as reflected in the
Company Financial Statements were classified and accounted for in accordance
with S.F.A.S. 115 and the intentions of management.   3.20 Interest Rate
Risk Management Arrangements. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.20 to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is a party to any, nor is any property bound by, any interest rate swaps,
caps, floors and option agreements or other interest rate risk management
arrangements.   3.21 Allowance for Loan Losses. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.21 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the allowance for loan
losses shown on the Company Financial Statements, as of such date was (and
will be as of such subsequent financial statement dates) in the reasonable
judgment of the Company, adequate in all material respects, based on past
loss experience and reasonably expected potential losses, to provide for
possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to loans previously
charged off, on loans outstanding, and contained an additional amount of
unallocated reserves for unanticipated future losses at a level considered
adequate under the standards applied by applicable federal and/or state
regulatory authorities and based upon generally accepted practices applicable
to financial institutions.   3.22 Company Benefit Plans. (a) Schedule
3.22(a)(i) to the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list and a true and
correct copy (or, a description with respect to any oral employee benefit
plan, practice, policy or arrangement), including all amendments thereto, of
each compensation, consulting, employment, termination or collective
bargaining agreement,   24    and each stock option, stock purchase,
stock appreciation right, recognition and retention, life, health, accident
or other insurance, bonus, deferred or incentive compensation, severance or
separation agreement or any agreement providing any payment or benefit
resulting from a change in control, profit sharing, retirement, or other
employee benefit plan, practice, policy or arrangement of any kind, oral or
written, covering employees, former employees, directors or former directors
of the Company or each Company Subsidiary or their respective beneficiaries,
including, but not limited to, any employee benefit plans within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA, which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
maintains, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary contributes, or
under which any employee, former employee, director or former director of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is covered or has benefit rights and
pursuant to which any liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
exists or is reasonably likely to occur (the "Company Benefit Plans"), and
current summary plan descriptions, trust agreements, and insurance contracts
and Internal Revenue Service Form 5500 or 5500-C/R (for the three
most recently completed plan years) with respect thereto. Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.22(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
neither maintains nor has entered into any Company Benefit Plan or other
document, plan or agreement which contains any change in control provisions
which would cause an increase or acceleration of benefits or benefit
entitlements to employees or former employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or their respective beneficiaries, or other provisions, which
would cause an increase in the liability of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or to Purchaser as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any related action thereafter (a "Change in Control
Benefit"). The term "Company Benefit Plans" as used herein refers to all
plans contemplated under the preceding sentences of this Section 3.22,
provided that the term "Plan" or "Plans" is used in this Agreement for
convenience only and does not constitute an acknowledgment that a particular
arrangement is an employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
been notified by any Governmental Authority to amend any payments or other
compensation paid or payable by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under
this Agreement, any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, to or for the benefit
of any employee or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and to
the best knowledge of the Company, all such payments are in compliance
with all applicable rules, regulations and bulletins promulgated by the
Governmental Authorities.   (b) Each of the Company Benefit Plans that is
intended to be a pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, thrift, savings or
employee stock ownership plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code ("Company Qualified Plans") has been determined by the Internal Revenue
Service to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, and, except as set forth
on Schedule 3.22(b) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, an application for
determination of such qualification has been timely made to the Internal
Revenue Service prior to the end of the applicable remedial amendment period
under Section 401(b) of the Code (a copy of the most recent determination
letter for each such Company Qualified Plan and each pending application is
included in Schedule 3.22(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), and, to the
best knowledge of the Company, there exists no circumstances likely to
materially adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company
Qualified Plan. Any Company Qualified Plan that is intended to be
a standardized or nonstandardized prototype has not been amended by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in any manner that may jeopardize its
status as a   25    standardized or nonstandardized prototype. All such
Company Qualified Plans established or maintained by the Company or each
Company Subsidiary or to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
contribute are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of ERISA, and are in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable requirements (including qualification and non-discrimination
requirements in effect as of the Effective Time) of the Code for obtaining
the tax benefits the Code thereupon permits with respect to such Company
Qualified Plans. No Company Qualified Plan is a defined benefit pension plan
which is subject to Title IV of ERISA. All accrued contributions and other
payments required to be made by the Company or each Company Subsidiary to any
Company Benefit Plan through the date hereof, have been made or reserves
adequate for such purposes as of the date hereof, have been set aside
therefor and reflected in the Company Financial Statements. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has accumulated any funding deficiency
under Section 412 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is in material default in performing any of its respective contractual
obligations under any of the Company Benefit Plans or any related trust
agreement or insurance contract, and there are no material
outstanding liabilities of any such Plan other than liabilities for benefits
to be paid to participants in such Plan and their beneficiaries in accordance
with the terms of such Plan.   (c) There is no pending or, to the best
knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation or pending claim (other than
individual benefit claims made in the ordinary course) by or on behalf of or
against any of the Company Benefit Plans (or with respect to the
administration of any of such Plans) now or heretofore maintained by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary which allege violations of applicable state
or federal law or the terms of the Plan which are reasonably likely to result
in a liability on the part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
such Plan.   (d) The Company and each Company Subsidiary and all other
persons having fiduciary or other responsibilities or duties with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan are, and since the inception of each such Plan have
been, in substantial compliance with, and each such Plan is and has been
operated in substantial accordance with, its provisions and in substantial
compliance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations governing such
Plan, including, without limitation, the rules and regulations promulgated by
the Department of Labor, the PBGC and the Internal Revenue Service under
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law. No "reportable event" (as
defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan. No Company Benefit Plan has engaged in or been a party to a
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975(c) of the Code) without an exemption thereto under Section 408 of ERISA
or Section 4975(d) of the Code. All Company Benefit Plans that are group
health plans have been operated in substantial compliance with the group
health plan continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and
Sections 601-609 of ERISA and with the certification of prior coverage and
other requirements of Sections 701-702 of ERISA.   (e) Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred, nor to the best knowledge of the
Company or such Company Subsidiary is reasonably likely to incur, any
liability under Title IV of ERISA in connection with any Plan subject to the

whatsoever of any Hazardous Materials or from any generation, transportation,
treatment, storage, disposal, use or handling of any Hazardous Materials.  
(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.23(c) to the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each Company Subsidiary are in
compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws
relating to pollution or protection of the environment such as laws relating
to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases of Hazardous
Materials or otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing, distribution,
use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous
Materials (together with all regulations and rules adopted thereunder).
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary have received notice of, nor

all governmental permits, licenses, certificates of inspection and other
authorizations governing or protecting the environment necessary to conduct

3.24 Material Contracts. Schedule 3.24 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth, each contract, indenture, and other binding commitment
and agreement (including any wholesale broker or loan purchase agreement, but
not including documents evidencing, governing or related to loans or credits
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or deposits or investments held by
the Bank) that provides for the receipt or expenditure of in excess of
$100,000 over the course of any twelve-month period, or which cannot be
terminated without penalty in excess of $50,000 to which the Company and/or
any Company Subsidiary is a party or   28    to which the Company
and/or any Company Subsidiary or any of their properties are subject
(collectively, the "Material Contracts" and each a "Material Contract"). True
copies of each Material Contract are set forth on Schedule 3.24 to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, including all material amendments
and supplements thereto. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.24 to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the Material Contracts are binding upon
the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries (as applicable) and, to the
Company\'s best knowledge, the other parties thereto. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have each duly performed in all material respects all of
its obligations under each Material Contract to which they are a party to the
extent that such obligations to perform have accrued. No breach or default
under any Material Contract by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or, to the Company\'s knowledge, any other party thereto, has occurred which
has had or which would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except as
disclosed on Schedule 3.24 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the
Material Contracts contains an express prohibition against assignment by
operation of law or a change of control of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary (or require written consent or notice to the other party), or
contains any other provision which would preclude Purchaser from exercising
and enjoying all of the rights, remedies and obligations of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, under such Material Contracts.  
3.25 Real Property. (a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary and
Tax Subsidiary have good, sufficient and marketable title to their real
properties, including any leaseholds and ground leases, and their other
assets and properties, all as reflected as owned by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Tax Subsidiary in the Company Financial Statements dated as
of September 30, 2002 except for (i) assets and properties disposed of since
such date in the ordinary course of business and (ii) such liens as set forth
in Schedule 3.25(a)(ii) to the Company Disclosure Schedule. All buildings,
structures, fixtures and appurtenances comprising part of the real properties
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary (whether owned or
leased by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary) are in
good operating condition and have been well maintained, reasonable wear and
tear excepted. Title to all real property listed as being owned by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary on the Company Disclosure
Schedule is held in fee simple. The Company and each Company Subsidiary or
Tax Subsidiary have title or other rights to its assets sufficient in all
material respects for the conduct of their respective businesses as presently
conducted, and such assets are free, clear and discharged of, and from any
and all liens, charges, encumbrances, security interests and/or equities. Set
forth in Schedule 3.25(a)(ii) to the Company Disclosure Schedule is a listing
of all real property owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary and used
for banking operations or which relate to low-income or senior housing real
estate investments. The Company\'s title to such properties are not subject
to any material exceptions or impairment and evidence of title will be
provided by the Company to Purchaser prior to the Effective Time.   (a) All
leases pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as lessee,
leases real or personal property are, to the best knowledge of the Company,
valid, effective, and enforceable against the lessor in accordance with their
respective terms. There is not under any of such leases any existing default,
or any event which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
default, with respect to either the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or to
the best knowledge of the Company, the other party. None of such leases  
29    contains a prohibition against assignment by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, by operation of law or otherwise, or any other provision
which would preclude Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary from possessing
and using the leased premises for the same purposes and upon the same rental
and other terms upon the consummation of the Merger as are applicable to the
possession and use by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the date of
this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made a
prior assignment for collateral purposes of any such lease.   3.26
Indemnification. To the best knowledge of the Company, no action or failure
to take action by any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
each Company Subsidiary has occurred which would give rise to a claim or a
potential claim by any such person for indemnification from the Company
or any Company Subsidiary under the corporate indemnification provisions of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in effect on the date of this
Agreement.   3.27 Insider Interests. All outstanding loans and other
contractual arrangements (including deposit relationships) between the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and any officer, director or employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary conform to the applicable rules and
regulations and requirements of all applicable regulatory agencies which were
in effect when such loans and other contractual arrangements were entered
into, and there are no violations of law or applicable regulation relating to
such loans or other contractual arrangements. No officer, director or
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any material interest
in any property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, used in or
pertaining to the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.   3.28
Rights Agreement. The Company and its Board of Directors have or will have
taken all necessary action to (i) render the Rights Agreement
inapplicable with respect to any aspect of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated herein, and (ii) ensure that neither Purchaser nor any of its
affiliates will be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" (as such term is
defined in the Rights Agreement) and no "Distribution Date" or "Share
Acquisition Date" (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement) occurs
by reason of announcement, approval, execution or delivery of any document
relating to the Merger or the consummation of any action contemplated
herein.   3.29 Advice of Changes. Between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, the Company shall promptly advise Purchaser in writing of any fact
which, if existing or known as of the date hereof, would have been required
to be set forth or disclosed in or pursuant to this Agreement or of any fact
which, if existing or known as of the date hereof, would have made any of
the representations contained herein untrue.   3.30 Fairness Opinion. The
Company has received an opinion, dated the date of this Agreement, from
Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc., that, subject to the terms, conditions and
qualifications set forth therein, the Merger Consideration is fair to the
Company\'s shareholders from a financial point of view.   3.31 Fees. Other
than the financial advisory services performed for the Company by Keefe,
Bruyette and Woods, Inc., neither the Company, nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries, nor   30    any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents, has employed a broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any financial advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions, or
finder\'s fees, and no broker or finder has acted directly or indirectly for
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.   3.32 Disclosure Schedules;
Materiality. The inclusion of any matters or items on the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall not constitute an acknowledgement by the Company (or evidence)
as to the materiality or Material Adverse Effect of any matter or item so
disclosed.   IV.   COVENANTS   4.1 Conduct of Business by the Company
Until the Effective Time. During the period commencing on the date hereof and
continuing until the Effective Time, the Company agrees (except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or to the extent that Purchaser shall
otherwise consent in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) that:   (a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
and each Company Subsidiary will carry on their respective businesses in, the
usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as
heretofore conducted, maintain their respective books in accordance with
GAAP, conduct their respective businesses and operations only in accordance
with safe and sound banking and business practices, and use all reasonable
efforts to preserve intact their present business organizations, to generally
keep available the services of their present officers and employees and to
preserve their relationships with customers, suppliers and others having
business dealings with them to the end that their respective goodwill and
going businesses shall be unimpaired at the Effective Time;   (b) The
Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, use their best
efforts to comply promptly with all requirements which federal or state law
may impose on any of them with respect to the Merger and will
promptly cooperate with and furnish information to Purchaser in connection
with any such requirements imposed upon any of them in connection with the
Merger;   (c) The Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to,
use their best efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with Purchaser in
obtaining) any consent, authorization or approval of, or any exemption by,
any governmental authority or agency, or other third party, required to be
obtained or made by any of them in connection with the Merger or the taking
of any action contemplated hereby. The Company will not, nor will it permit
any of the Company Subsidiaries to, knowingly or willfully take any action
that would adversely affect the ability of such party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement;   (d) The Company (i) will not declare or
pay any cash dividends on or make other distributions with respect to capital
stock, except that the Company will be permitted to declare and pay a regular
quarterly cash dividend per share not exceeding $0.20, and (ii) except as
provided below, will not declare or pay any cash dividends or make any
distributions on Company Common Stock in the calendar quarter in which the
Effective Time shall occur prior to   31    Purchaser\'s dividend record
date entitling the holders of Company Common Stock to receive regular
quarterly cash dividends on the shares of Purchaser Common Stock into which
the shares of Company Common Stock have been converted. It is the intent of
clause (ii) of this Subsection to provide that the holders of Company Common
Stock will receive either payment of cash dividends on their shares of
Company Common Stock as permitted under (i) of this Subsection or the payment
of cash dividends as the holders of shares of Purchaser Common Stock received
in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock for the calendar quarter
during which the Effective Time shall occur, but will not receive and will
not become entitled to receive for the same calendar quarter both the payment
of a permitted dividend as shareholders of the Company and the payment of a
cash dividend as the holders of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock received
in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock, including, for purposes
of this limitation, cash dividends paid by Purchaser within seven (7) days
following the end of such calendar quarter. In the event that the
Company does not declare and pay permitted dividends on Company Common Stock
in a particular calendar quarter because of the Company\'s expectation that
the Effective Time would occur in said calendar quarter wherein the holders
of Company Common Stock would have become entitled to receive cash dividends
for such calendar quarter on the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to have
been exchanged for the shares of Company Common Stock, and the Effective Time
does not in fact occur in said calendar quarter, then, as a result thereof,
the Company shall be entitled to declare and pay a permitted dividend (within
the limitations of this Section 4.1(d)) on said shares of Company Common
Stock for said calendar quarter as soon as reasonably practicable. The
Company shall not make any changes in its normal practice of establishing
dividend record or dividend payment dates;   (e) The Company will not, and
will not permit any Company Subsidiary to, sell, lease or otherwise dispose
of any assets, except in the ordinary course of business, which are material,
individually or in the aggregate, to the business or financial condition of
the Company on a consolidated basis;   (f) The Company will not, and will
not permit any Company Subsidiary to, acquire by merging or consolidating
with, purchasing substantially all of the assets of or otherwise, any
business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof;   (g) Except as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement or pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options, the
Company will not, and will not permit any Company Subsidiary to, or enter
into any agreement to, issue, sell, grant, authorize or propose the issuance
or sale of, or purchase or propose the purchase of, permit the conversion of
or otherwise acquire or transfer for any consideration any shares of their
respective capital stocks of any class or securities convertible into, or
rights, warrants or options to acquire, any such shares or other convertible
securities, or to increase or decrease the number of shares of capital stock
by split-up, reclassification, reverse split, stock dividend, stock split or
change in par or stated value. No additional shares of Company Common Stock
shall become subject to new grants of employee stock options, stock
appreciation rights, limited rights or similar stock-based employee
compensation rights, including, but not limited to, grants under the RRP
Plan;   (h) The Company will not, and will not permit any Company
Subsidiary to, create or incur any liabilities, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, in excess of   32    $100,000 other
than the taking of deposits and other liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practices, or permit or suffer the
imposition on any shares of stock held by it or by any Company Subsidiary of
any material lien, charge or encumbrance;   (i) The Company will not, and
will not permit any Company Subsidiary to, grant to any director, officer or
employee any increase in compensation (except as provided in this Agreement
or in accordance with past practices for those employees who are not
executive or senior management), make contributions to any Company Benefit
Plan (except in accordance with the provisions of the letter agreement
referenced in Section 5.14(g)) or pay any bonus (except in accordance with
past practices or plans or agreements with respect to employees other than
executive or senior management or, with respect to executive or senior
management employees in accordance with past practices or plans
and agreements (calculated without reference to conforming entries under
Section 5.20 and similar merger related charges) and provided that the total
of such amounts shall not (i) in the aggregate exceed the lesser of the
aggregate amount (A) accrued by the Company and/or the Bank for such bonuses,
or (B) of such bonuses as paid for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002,
or (ii) exceed on an individual basis any bonus amount (or prorated amount
for a partial fiscal year) received by such individual for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2002), or (iii) increase in any severance or termination
pay, or enter into or amend any employment, special termination, retention,
covenant not to compete or severance agreement with any such person except as
contemplated in this Agreement;   (j) Except as set forth on Schedule
4.1(j) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company, nor any
Company Subsidiary, will enter into, renew, extend, amend or modify any
material lease or license with respect to any property, whether real or
personal;   (k) Neither the Company, nor any Company Subsidiary, will enter
into or amend any continuing contract or series of related contracts
involving in excess of $100,000 for the purchase of materials, supplies,
equipment or services which cannot be terminated without cause with less than
ninety (90) days\' notice and without payment of any amount as a penalty
bonus, premium or other compensation for such termination except as
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement;   (l) The Company will not,
and will not permit any Company Subsidiary to, adopt or amend in any material
respect any collective bargaining, employee pension, profit-sharing,
retirement, employee stock ownership, insurance, incentive compensation,

arrangement for the benefit of employees, except as contemplated herein;  
(m) The Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, use their
best efforts to maintain their respective properties and assets in
their present states of repair, order and condition, reasonable wear and
tear excepted, and to maintain and keep in full force and effect all policies
of insurance presently in effect, including the insurance of accounts with
the FDIC. The Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, take
all requisite action (including without limitation the making of claims and
the giving of notices) pursuant to their directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policies in order to preserve all rights thereunder  
33    with respect to all matters known by the Company which could
reasonably give rise to a claim prior to the Effective Time;   (n) The
Company will not, and will not permit any Company Subsidiary to, amend their
respective Articles of Incorporation, Charters, or by-laws, except as
contemplated by this Agreement;   (o) Except with approval by the Senior
Vice President-Business Banking of Purchaser upon his review of materials
prepared for the Bank\'s weekly loan committee meeting, the Company will not,

has an existing debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.20), (iii)
business loan in an amount in excess of $500,000, or in any amount which,
when aggregated with any and all loans to the same borrower, would be
in excess of $1,000,000 (and only in the event such loan has an existing
debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.20), (iv) loan or credit
commitment to (including letters of credit and including investments in, or
agreements to invest in) any person or entity who is listed as a borrower on
a "watch list" or similar internal report of the Company or the Bank, (v)

credit commitment in an amount in excess of $1,000,000, or in any amount
which, when aggregated with any and all loans to the same borrower would be
in excess of $2,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees
that for any commercial real estate or business loan subject to (ii) or (iii)
above in excess of $500,000 (or which would if aggregated with other loans to
the same borrower result in loans to that borrower in excess of $1,000,000),
and with respect to any other loan subject to (ix) above in excess of
$1,000,000 (or which if aggregated with other loans to the same borrower
would result in loans to that borrower in excess of $2,000,000) it will
consult with Purchaser regarding the evaluation of such credit prior to
making or renewing the loan. The Company further agrees to consult with
Purchaser prior to renewing or extending the maturity date on any loan or
other extension of credit (including letters of credit and
including investments in, or agreements to invest in) to any person or entity
which is on a "watch list" or similar internal report of the Company or Bank
where the amount of such credit is in excess of $500,000 and not to grant
such renewal or extension without Purchaser\'s consent where the amount
involved exceeds $1,000,000 unless the Company believes that a failure to
renew or extend may expose it to legal liability. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event may the Company or a Company Subsidiary enter into,
renew, increase or materially modify any loan or credit commitment except in

provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the Company
or any Company Subsidiary from honoring any contractual obligation in
existence on the date of this Agreement;   (p) The Company will not, and
will not permit any Company Subsidiary to, take any action which would, or

permit any Company Subsidiary to: (i) materially restructure or change its
investment securities portfolio, through purchases, sales or otherwise, as

foregoing or engage in any transaction with any of the foregoing which is
prohibited by 12 U.S.C. 371c and 12 U.S.C. 371c-1 or by applicable
regulation. For purposes of this Subsection, "control" shall have the meaning
associated with that term under 12 U.S.C. 371c;   (t) The Company will
promptly advise Purchaser orally and in writing of any event or series of
events which has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect or which may have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or any Company Subsidiary or which may
adversely affect the satisfaction of any condition to the consummation of the
Merger or the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this

with the acceptance of repurchase agreements or government deposits or if in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;   (z)

violation of any provision of this Agreement, except, in every case, as may

to comply with such prohibitions. The Company shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to such activities. The

all meetings of the Boards of Directors of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary, and (ii) all meetings of the committees of each such Board of
Directors, including without limitation the audit and executive committees

with any materials that would be in violation of applicable law or that
relates to an Acquisition Transaction (except for information to be provided
as required by Section 4.3 hereof) or which pertain to the evaluation of the
Merger. All information provided to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.2
shall be treated in confidence as provided in Section 5.1(b) hereof.  
39     5.3 Bank Merger. The Company and Purchaser intend to take all
action necessary and appropriate to cause to be entered into the Bank Merger

DandO; Indemnification.   (a) Purchaser hereby agrees that for six (6) years
after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause to be maintained in effect
the Company\'s and the Company Subsidiary\'s current policy of officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance with respect to actions and omissions
occurring on or prior to the Effective Date; provided, however, that
Purchaser may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
covered persons provided that such substitution shall not result in any
lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time; provided, further, that Purchaser shall not be required to
pay an annual premium in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid by
the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof (which
premium is disclosed in Schedule 5.4 to the Company Disclosure Schedule) and
if Purchaser is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.4,
Purchaser shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual
premium equal to such maximum amount.   (b) From and after the Effective
Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Purchaser and Mid
America (each an "Indemnifying Party" and together the "Indemnifying
Parties") jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is now or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, or trustee of any benefit plan of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for unaffiliated corporate trustees
(the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters involving the Company, and/or any Company Subsidiary
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or through the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent to which the Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary is permitted or required by law or their respective
Articles of Incorporation (or other chartering document) and Bylaws to
indemnify such Indemnified Parties and in the manner to which it could
indemnify such parties under the Articles of Incorporation (or other
chartering document) and Bylaws of such entity, in each case as in effect on
the date hereof, or under applicable law. All rights to indemnification in
respect of or related to any cause or matter subject to indemnification
asserted or claimed within such period shall continue until final disposition
of such cause or matter.   (c) Following the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Indemnifying Parties jointly and severally agree that
they shall, for an additional six (6) years, indemnify and hold harmless each
of the Indemnified Parties against any costs or expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation,   40    whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters involving the
Company, and/or any Company Subsidiary existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including in connection with the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, asserted or claimed after the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time and at or prior to the twelfth anniversary thereof; provided,
however; such indemnification described in this Section 5.4(c) shall not
exceed $500,000 in the aggregate (and the Indemnifying Parties shall not
be responsible for any costs or expenses in excess of such amount)
provided, further, that the Indemnifying Parties shall not be responsible to
indemnify for the amount of any judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities for which an Indemnified Party is held liable as a result of a
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil or criminal,
administrative or investigative, asserted or claimed subsequent to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time. All rights to indemnification in respect
of or related to any cause or matter subject to indemnification asserted or
claimed within such period shall continue until final disposition of such
cause or matter.   (d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under Section 5.4(b) or (c), upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the
appropriate Indemnifying Party thereof. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to promptly and timely assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party
elects not to, or fails to promptly and timely assume such defense, or to
appropriately defend such claim once assumed (except with respect to any
settlement contemplated below), the Indemnified Party may retain counsel
which is reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser to handle such defense and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses to all such
counsel for an Indemnified Party (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction for an Indemnified Party), and notwithstanding any assumption of
such defense by the Indemnifying Party, an Indemnified Party may retain
counsel of its own choosing to monitor such defense (with the Indemnified
Party assuming any and all expenses as a result of hiring such counsel); (ii)
the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; (iii)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall not
make any settlement of any such claim without prior written consent of
an Indemnified Party.   5.5 Affiliate Letters. The Company shall obtain and
deliver to Purchaser on the date hereof a signed representation letter as to
certain restrictions on resale substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto
from each executive officer and director of the Company and each shareholder
of the Company who may reasonably be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company
within the meaning of such term as used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act,
and shall obtain and deliver to Purchaser a signed representation letter
substantially in the form of Exhibit D from any person who becomes an
executive officer or director of the Company or any shareholder who becomes
such an "affiliate" after the date hereof as promptly as practicable after
(and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver within five
(5) business days after) such person achieves such status. The letter
described in this Section 5.5 shall include certain provisions pursuant to
which such individuals will agree to vote in favor of the Merger.  
41     5.6 Regulatory Applications. Purchaser shall, as soon as
practicable, file applications or notices with the applicable Governmental
Authorities, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to all inquiries received concerning said
applications; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have no obligation to
accept nonstandard conditions or restrictions with respect to the aforesaid
approvals of Governmental Authorities if it shall reasonably determine that
such conditions or restrictions would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Purchaser. In the event of an adverse or unfavorable determination by any
Governmental Authority, or in the event the Merger is challenged or opposed
by any administrative or legal proceeding, whether by the United States
Department of Justice or otherwise, the determination of whether and to what
extent to seek appeal or review, administrative or otherwise, or other
appropriate remedies shall be made by Purchaser after consultation with the
Company. Except for confidential portions reflecting pro forma financial
information prepared by Purchaser, Purchaser shall deliver a draft of
regulatory applications relating to the Merger or this Agreement to the
Company prior to filing them, and copies of responses from or written
communications from regulatory authorities relating thereto, and Purchaser
shall deliver a final copy of all regulatory applications to the Company
promptly after they are filed with the appropriate regulatory authority.  
5.7 Financial Statements and Reports. From the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time: (a) each party will deliver to the other,
not later than ninety days after the end of any fiscal year, its Annual

period then ended as filed with the SEC, which shall be prepared in
conformity with GAAP and the rules and regulations of the SEC; (b) the
Company will deliver to Purchaser not later than thirty days after the end of
any fiscal quarter, the quarterly reports filed with the OTS by the Company
or the Bank which shall be prepared in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the OTS; (c) each party will deliver to the other not later
than forty-five days after the end of each of its first three (3) fiscal
quarters, its report on Form 10-Q for such quarter as filed with the SEC
which shall be prepared in conformity with GAAP and the rules and regulations
of the SEC; (d) the Company will deliver to Purchaser any and all other
material reports filed with the SEC, the FDIC, the OTS or any
other regulatory agency within five (5) business days of the filing of any
such report; and (e) the Company will deliver to Purchaser monthly
financial statements which shall include a summary of the investment
securities acquired in the ordinary course of business.   5.8 Registration
Statement; Shareholder Approval. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, Purchaser shall prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 covering the Purchaser Common Stock to be issued to
holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger, which Registration Statement
shall include the Proxy Statement for use in soliciting proxies for the
special meetings of shareholders (the "Shareholders\' Meeting") to be held
by each of Purchaser and the Company for purposes of considering the Merger,
and Purchaser and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities
Act. Purchaser will take any reasonable action required to be taken under the
applicable blue sky or securities laws in connection with the issuance of the
shares of Purchaser Common Stock in the Merger. Each party shall furnish all
information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as the other
party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing of
the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement and related actions. Purchaser
and the Company shall each call a meeting of shareholders as  
42    soon as reasonably practicable after the effective date of the
Registration Statement for the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the
Merger. In connection with the Shareholders\' Meeting, (a) Purchaser and the
Company shall jointly prepare the Proxy Statement as part of the Registration
Statement, and Purchaser and the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to
their respective shareholders, on a date mutually acceptable to the parties
hereto (the "Mailing Date"); (b) the Boards of Directors of Purchaser and the
Company shall unanimously recommend to their respective shareholders the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger (subject to the receipt of a
fairness opinion from their respective investment bankers dated as of the
mailing date of the Proxy Statement), and (c) the Boards of Directors of
Purchaser and the Company shall otherwise use their best efforts, to the
extent consistent with the fiduciary duty of each, to obtain such shareholder
approval.   5.9 Notice. At all times prior to the Effective Time, each party
shall give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence or its knowledge of
any event or condition that would cause any of its representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement not to be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Effective
Time, or any of its obligations set forth in this Agreement required to be
performed at or prior to the Effective Time not to be performed in all
material respects at or prior to the Effective Time, including without
limitation, any event, condition, change or occurrence which individually, or
in the aggregate with any other events, conditions or changes that have
occurred after the date hereof, has resulted or which, so far as reasonably
can be foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is reasonably likely to result
in a Material Adverse Effect on it. After receipt of any such notice
disclosing a material breach, the nondisclosing party may, within five (5)
business days thereof, notify the disclosing party of its intent to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d); provided, however, that the
disclosing party shall have the right to cure such breach within 30
days thereof but no later than the Effective Time. In the event the
nondisclosing party fails to notify the disclosing party of its intent to
terminate within five (5) business days after receipt of any notice
hereunder, the nondisclosing party shall be deemed to have waived its right
of termination as to any such breach arising out of or with respect to the
events, conditions, change or occurrence described in such notice; provided,
however, that any particular breach that is deemed to have been waived by the
nondisclosing party may thereafter be considered by the nondisclosing party
in determining the aggregate contribution of all events, conditions, changes
and occurrences described by the disclosing party pursuant to this Section
5.9 toward the occurrence of a material breach by the disclosing party.  
5.10 Press Releases. Purchaser and the Company shall coordinate all publicity
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except as
otherwise required by law, or with respect to employee meetings, neither
party shall issue any press release, publicity statement or other
public notice relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior consent of the other, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall obtain the
prior consent of Purchaser with respect to the content of any communication
to its shareholders.   5.11 Delivery of Supplements to Disclosure Schedules.
Five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Purchaser
will supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule and Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, respectively, with respect to any matter hereafter
arising which, if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of this
Agreement, would   43    have been required to be set forth or described
in such Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any information
in the Company Disclosure Schedule and Purchaser Disclosure Schedule in any
representation and warranty made by the disclosing party which has been
rendered inaccurate thereby. For purposes of determining the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Purchaser and the Company contained in
Article II and Article III hereof, respectively, and in order to determine
the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof as of the
Effective Time, the Company Disclosure Schedule and Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to include only the information contained therein on
the date hereof and any information previously disclosed by the Company and
Purchaser, respectively, pursuant to Section 5.9 as to which Purchaser or the
Company is deemed to have waived its right of termination; provided, however,
that delivery of such supplements containing information which causes any
representation or warranty of the Company or Purchaser to be false or
materially misleading will not cure any breach hereunder of
such representations or warranties.   5.12 Tax Opinion. Purchaser and the
Company shall obtain a written opinion ("Tax Opinion") of Vedder, Price,
Kaufman and Kammholz addressed to Purchaser and the Company, dated the Closing
Date, subject to customary representations and assumptions referred to
therein, and substantially to the effect that (a) the Merger will constitute
a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
and Purchaser and the Company will each be a party to such reorganization;
(b) the exchange in the Merger of Purchaser Common Stock for Company Common
Stock will not give rise to the recognition of any income, gain or loss to
Purchaser, the Company, or the shareholders of the Company with respect to
such exchange except, with respect to the shareholders of the Company, to the
extent of cash received for fractional shares; (c) the adjusted tax basis of
the Purchaser Common Stock received by Company shareholders in the Merger
will equal the adjusted tax basis of the Company Common Stock exchanged
therefor decreased by the amount of money received in the exchange and
increased by the amount of gain recognized in the exchange; (d) the holding
period of the Purchaser Common Stock received in the Merger will include the
period during which the shares of Company Common Stock surrendered
in exchange therefor were held, provided such shares of Company Common Stock
were held as a capital asset at the Effective Time; (e) the adjusted tax
basis of the assets of the Company in the hands of Purchaser will be the same
as the adjusted tax basis of such assets in the hands of the Company
immediately prior to the exchange; and (f) the holding period of the assets
of the Company transferred to Purchaser will include the period during which
such assets were held by the Company prior to the exchange.   5.13 Tax
Treatment. Neither the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Purchaser, the
Purchaser Subsidiaries, nor any of their affiliates, shall voluntarily take
any action which would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. In addition, Purchaser and
the Company agree to take any and all necessary or advisable steps
to restructure or modify the terms of the transaction contemplated hereby, if
such steps are necessary or advisable to qualify the transaction contemplated
hereby as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code;
provided, however, nothing contained in this Section 5.13 shall be deemed to
require Purchaser to take any steps which will increase the Merger
Consideration provided for in Section 1.2.   44     5.14 Resolution of
Company Benefit Plans. The Company and Purchaser shall cooperate in effecting
the following treatment of the Company Benefit Plans, except as mutually
agreed upon by Purchaser and the Company prior to the Effective Time:   (a)
At the Effective Time, Purchaser (or a Purchaser Subsidiary) shall be
substituted for the Company as the sponsoring employer under those Company
Benefit Plans with respect to which the Company or the Bank is a sponsoring
employer immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall assume and be
vested with all of the powers, rights, duties, obligations and liabilities
previously vested in the Company or the Bank with respect to each such plan.
Except as otherwise provided herein, each such plan and any Company Benefit
Plan sponsored by the Company or the Bank shall be continued in effect by
Purchaser or any applicable Purchaser Subsidiary after the Effective
Time without a termination or discontinuance thereof as a result of the
Merger, subject to the power reserved to Purchaser or any applicable
Purchaser Subsidiary under each such plan to subsequently amend or terminate
the plan, which amendments or terminations shall comply with applicable law.
The Company, the Bank and Purchaser will use all reasonable efforts (i) to
effect said substitutions and assumptions, and take such other actions
contemplated under this Agreement, and (ii) to amend such plans as to the
extent necessary to provide for said substitutions and assumptions, and such
other actions contemplated under this Agreement.   (b) Except as
contemplated in any Letter of Understanding or the letter agreement referred
to in Section 5.14(g) below, at or as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, as Purchaser shall reasonably determine, Purchaser shall
provide, or cause any Purchaser Subsidiary to provide, to each employee of
the Company and the Bank as of the Effective Time ("Company Employees") the
opportunity to participate in each employee benefit plan and program
maintained by Purchaser or the Purchaser Subsidiaries for similarly situated
employees (the "Purchaser Benefit Plans"); provided, however, that
with respect to such Purchaser Benefit Plans, Company Employees shall be
given credit for service with the Company or the Bank in determining
eligibility for and vesting in benefits thereunder, but not for purposes of
benefit accrual; provided, further that Company Employees shall not be
subject to any waiting periods or pre-existing condition exclusions under the
Purchaser Benefit Plans to the extent that such periods are longer or
restrictions impose a greater limitation than the periods or limitations
imposed under the Company Benefit Plans; provided, further, that to the
extent that the initial period of coverage for Company Employees under any
Purchaser Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA is not a full 12-month period of coverage, Company
Employees shall be given credit under the applicable Purchaser Benefit Plans
for any deductibles and co-insurance payments made by such Company Employees
under the Company Benefit Plans during the balance of such 12-month period of
coverage; provided, further that Company Employees shall receive a
contribution to the ESOP and in the Savings and Retirement
Plan (collectively, the "Qualified Retirement Plans") for the portion of the
plan years during which such Qualified Retirement Plans are maintained by the
Company or Purchaser (whether or not such employees satisfy any service or
employment requirements of the Qualified Retirement Plan after the Effective
Time); and the participants shall be fully vested in such Qualified
Retirement Plans as of the Effective Time for such portion of the plan year.
Nothing in the preceding sentence shall obligate Purchaser to provide or
cause to be provided any benefits duplicative of those provided under any
Company Benefit Plan continued pursuant to subparagraph (a) above, including,
but not limited to, extending participation in any Purchaser  
45    Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" under ERISA
with respect to any year during which allocations are made to Company
Employees under the Company ESOP or Savings and Retirement Plan. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, the power of Purchaser or any Purchaser
Subsidiary to amend or terminate any benefit plan or program, including any
Company Benefit Plan, shall not be altered or affected. Moreover, this
Agreement shall not confer upon any Company Employee any rights or remedies
hereunder and shall not constitute a contract of employment or create the
rights, to be retained or otherwise, in employment with Purchaser or any
Purchaser Subsidiary.   (c) Concurrently with or immediately after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain
from each officer of the Company who is a party to an employment agreement or
special termination agreement with the Company or the Bank a statement of
benefits with Purchaser and the Company substantially in the form of Exhibit
E attached hereto (each such statement of benefits referred to herein, as a
"Letter of Understanding"), addressing certain matters pertaining to such
executive\'s employment agreement or special termination agreement and
benefits payable thereunder, and where applicable, such executive\'s
employment after the Effective Date.   (d) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, all retention, severance, covenant not to compete,
termination payments, acceleration of benefit vesting, and other compensation
paid by the Company or the Bank, or as provided for in this Agreement, any
Letter of Understanding, any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, including,
but not limited to, any Change in Control Benefit, shall not violate any
prohibitions which are imposed by any Governmental Authorities, or which any
Governmental Authorities otherwise deem to constitute unsafe and unsound
banking practices giving effect to any obligations of Purchaser or the
Purchaser Subsidiary as provided herein or in any Letter of

paid by Purchaser. The Company shall fully cooperate with Purchaser to
provide the consultant reasonable access to the premises under assessment.
The consultant shall complete and deliver the Phase I assessments not later

foregoing;   (d) By Purchaser or the Company in the event of the material
breach by the other party of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein or in any schedule or document delivered pursuant
hereto, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy the closing
conditions set forth in Section 6.2 hereof, in the case of Purchaser, or

affiliates, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(A) after consultation with an outside financial advisor, that such Takeover
Proposal (if consummated in accordance with its terms) would be more
favorable to the Company\'s shareholders than the Merger (a "Superior

consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,

Merger Consideration if:   (i) in the event of a termination by the Company
pursuant to Section  7.1(c) or (h), or by Purchaser pursuant to Section
7.1(c) or (i), at any  time within eighteen (18) months after such
termination a Third Party  Acquisition Event (as defined   54

with respect to a Third Party Acquisition Event. As used in this Agreement,

transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person or group 
(as such term is defined under the Exchange Act), other than Acquiror or  any

percent (20%) of the equity securities or voting power of the Company or  any
Company Subsidiary, pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or

series of transactions pursuant to which any Third Party acquires (or  would
acquire upon completion of such transaction or series of  transactions)
control of the Board of Directors of the Company or by which  nominees of any
Third Party are (or would be) elected or appointed to a  majority of the
seats on the Board of Directors of the Company; or   (ii) the Purchaser
shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to  Section 7.1(c) and (A) the
Board of Directors of the Company (1) shall have  withdrawn, modified or
amended in any respect its approval or  recommendation of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby,  (2) shall not at the appropriate time
have unanimously recommended or shall  have withdrawn or changed in any
respect its recommendation that its  stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, or (3) shall  not have included such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or (B) the  Board of Directors of the
Company shall have resolved to do any of the  foregoing in clause (A).

Agreement under Section 7.1(i) because any of the events described in Section
7.1(i) have occurred after the Company sought and failed to obtain a bring-
down fairness opinion; provided, however, that if any Third Party Acquisition
Event described in Section 7.2(a) occurs within eighteen (18) months after
such termination, Purchaser shall be entitled to the additional
amounts payable under such provisions.   55     (c) If Purchaser
terminates this Agreement otherwise than in accordance with its rights to do
so pursuant to Sections 7.1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (i), or if the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d), Purchaser shall
pay to the Company upon demand a termination payment in the amount of Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000). Any sum payable by Purchaser to the Company
pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.2(c) shall constitute liquidated
damages under this Agreement and the receipt thereof shall be the Company\'s
sole and exclusive remedy.   7.3 Expenses. Except as provided elsewhere
herein, Purchaser and the Company shall each bear and pay all costs and
expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial or
other consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel. In the event
one of the parties hereto files suit to enforce this Section or a suit
seeking to recover costs and expenses or damages for breach of this
Agreement, the costs, fees, charges and expenses (including attorneys\' fees
and expenses) of the prevailing party in such litigation (and any related
litigation) shall be borne by the losing party.   7.4 Survival of
Agreements. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Purchaser
or the Company as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect except that (i) the agreements contained in
Sections 5.1(b), 5.10, 7.2 and 7.3 hereof shall survive the termination
hereof; and (ii) a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d) hereof shall not
relieve a breaching party from any liability for any breach giving rise to
such termination (except as otherwise provided herein).   7.5 Amendment.
This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by their
respective Boards of Directors at any time before or after approval hereof by
the stockholders of Purchaser or the Company but, after such approval, no
amendment shall be made which changes the form of consideration or adversely
affects or decreases the value of the consideration to be received by the
shareholders of the Company without the further approval of such shareholders
or which in any other way adversely affects the rights of the stockholders of
either the Company or Purchaser without the further required approval of the
stockholders so affected. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.
Purchaser and the Company may, without approval of their respective Boards of
Directors, make such technical changes to this Agreement, not inconsistent
with the purposes hereof and thereof, as may be required to effect or
facilitate any governmental approval or acceptance of the Merger or of
this Agreement or to effect or facilitate any filing or recording required
for the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.   7.6
Waiver. Any term, provision or condition of this Agreement (other than
requirements for stockholder approval and required approvals of
the Governmental Authorities) may be waived in writing at any time by the
party which is entitled to the benefits hereof. Each and every right granted
to any party hereunder, or under any other document delivered in connection
herewith or therewith, and each and every right allowed it by law or equity,
shall be cumulative and may be exercised from time to time. The failure of
either party at any time or times to require performance of any provision
hereof shall in no manner affect such party\'s right at a later time to
enforce the same except as provided in Section 5.9. No waiver by any party of
a condition or of the breach of any term, covenant, representation or
warranty contained in this   56    Agreement, whether by conduct or
otherwise, in any one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as
a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of
any other condition or of the breach of any other term, covenant,
representation or warranty of this Agreement. No investigation, review or

President and Chief Executive Officer   60     EXHIBIT D   Form of 
AFFILIATE LETTER   May 20, 2003  MAF Bancorp, Inc. 55th and Holmes
Avenue Clarendon Hills, Illinois 60514  Ladies and Gentlemen:   I have
been advised that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of St. Francis Capital Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the
"Company"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c)
and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations ("Rules and Regulations") of
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of May 20, 2003 ("Merger
Agreement"), by and between MAF Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Purchaser"), and the Company, pursuant to which the Company shall be merged
with and into Purchaser (the "Merger") and the stockholders of the Company
shall be entitled to receive shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Purchaser ("Purchaser Common Stock") in exchange for shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock").   As a result of the Merger, I may be entitled to receive shares of
Purchaser Common Stock in exchange for shares owned by me of the Company
Common Stock (or upon exercise of options to purchase shares or upon the
exercise by me of rights under certain option plans of the Company that
become exercisable upon the consummation of the Merger) (collectively, the
"Purchaser Securities").   I represent, warrant and covenant to Purchaser
that in the event I receive any shares of Purchaser Securities as a result of
the Merger:   A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition
of Purchaser Securities in violation of the Act or the Rules and
Regulations.   B. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement
and discussed the requirements of such documents and other applicable
limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
Purchaser Securities to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or
counsel for the Company.   C. I have been advised that the issuance of
Purchaser Securities to me pursuant to the Merger shall be registered with
the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4.
However, I have also been advised that, because (a) at the time the Merger
shall be submitted for a vote of the shareholders of the Company, I may be
deemed to be an affiliate of the Company and (b) the distribution by me of
Purchaser Securities has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of Purchaser Securities    MAF Bancorp,
Inc. May 20, 2003 Page 2  issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145(d) promulgated by the Commission under the Act ("Rule
145(d)"), (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered
under the Act or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Act.   D. I understand that, except as provided in
the Merger Agreement, Purchaser is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of Purchaser Securities by me or on my behalf
under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available.   E. I also
understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Purchaser\'s
transfer agents with respect to Purchaser Securities issued to me and that
there will be placed on the certificates for Purchaser Securities issued to
me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:   "THE
SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH
RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF  1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE  TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED MAY 20,  2003 BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER
HEREOF AND MAF BANCORP, INC., A  COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE
PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF MAF  BANCORP, INC."   F. I also understand that,
unless the sale or transfer by me of Purchaser Securities has been registered
under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule
145, Purchaser reserves the right to put the following legend on the
certificates issued to my transferee:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE WERE ACQUIRED IN A  TRANSACTION THAT WAS NOT REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933  AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH
SHARES IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF  1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH
A  VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF 
WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, 
PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN  EXEMPTION FROM
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF  1933."   G. I
hereby agree that at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company however
called, and in any action by written consent to the shareholders of the
Company, I (solely in my capacity as a shareholder) shall vote the Company
Common Stock which I am    MAF Bancorp, Inc. May 20, 2003 Page
3  entitled to vote (a) in favor of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (b) against any action or agreement
which would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or
any other obligation of the Company under the Merger Agreement; and (c)
against any action or agreement which would impede or interfere with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited
to: (i) any change in the management or Board of Directors of the Company,
except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Purchaser; (ii) any change in the
present capitalization or dividend policy of the Company; or (iii) any other
material change in the Company\'s corporate structure or business.   H. I
agree (solely in my capacity as a shareholder) not to vote or execute any
written consent to rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written
consent to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby.   I. I agree (solely in my capacity as a
shareholder) to use my best efforts to cause the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be consummated.   J.
Prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), I will not
sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of (including,
without limitation, by the creation of a Lien (as defined below) that would
cause the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Liens
to exceed the number shares in Section K below), or permit to be sold,
assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, any shares of Company Common
Stock owned of record or beneficially by me, whether such shares of Company
Common Stock are owned of record or beneficially by me on the date of the
Merger Agreement or are subsequently acquired, whether pursuant to the
exercise of stock options or otherwise, except (i) for transfers by will or
by operation of law (in which case this letter agreement shall bind the
transferee); (ii) for sales, assignments, transfers or other dispositions
necessitated by hardship with the prior written consent of Purchaser; or
(iii) as Purchaser may otherwise agree in writing.   K. I represent that
(i) I have the complete and unrestricted power and the unqualified right to
enter into and perform the terms of this letter agreement; (ii) this letter
agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement with respect to me,
enforceable against me in accordance with its terms; and (iii) I own the
shares of Company Common Stock free and clear of any liens, claims, charges
or other encumbrances and restrictions of any kind whatsoever ("Liens")
except as noted below as of the date hereof, and have sole and unrestricted
voting power with respect in such shares of Company Common Stock:

letter.   Very truly yours,    ______________________________________
