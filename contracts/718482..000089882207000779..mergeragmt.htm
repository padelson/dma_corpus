I understand that, except as provided in the Merger Agreement, Wachovia is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of Wachovia Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available, except the obligation to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as more fully described below.</FONT></P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif>3. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Wachovia&#146;s transfer agent with respect to the shares of Wachovia Common Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates for such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=serif>&#147;The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, applies. The shares represented by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance with the terms of a letter agreement between the registered holder hereof and Wachovia, a copy of which agreement is on file at the principal offices of Wachovia.&#148;</FONT></P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif>4. I understand that, unless transfer by me of the Wachovia Common Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the Securities Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, Wachovia reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to place the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=serif>&#147;The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.&#148;</FONT></P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif>I understand and agree that the legends set forth in paragraph 3 or 4 above, as the case may be, will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if I deliver to Wachovia (a) a copy of a &#147;no-action&#148; letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Wachovia, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act, or (b) evidence or representations reasonably satisfactory to Wachovia that Wachovia Common Stock represented by such certificates is being or has been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act.</FONT></P>
