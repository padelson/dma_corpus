 **ARTICLE 2** 
 The Merger; Certain Related Matters

  



  

Section 2.01 _. The Merger; Closing. _(a) __ As soon as practicable, and in
any event not more than five Business Days, after satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the
Company and Parent shall file articles of merger with the State Corporation
Commission of Virginia and the Maryland State Department of Assessments and
Taxation (the " **MSDAT** ") and make all other filings or recordings
required by Virginia Law or Maryland Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become

  



        
   

  



  

effective (the " **Effective Time** ") at the later of the time the
Certificate of Merger is issued by the Virginia State Corporation Commission
and the time a Certificate of Merger is issued by the MSDAT (or at such later
time as may be specified in the Certificates of Merger) in accordance with
the VSCA and Maryland Law. Upon and following the Merger, the
separate existence of the Company shall cease, and Parent shall be the
Surviving Corporation (the " **Surviving Corporation** ") in the Merger and
shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Maryland. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be
"Mercantile Bankshares Corporation".

  



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Parent, all as provided under Virginia Law and Maryland Law.

  



  

(c) The closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") shall take place at
such time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree, on the date when
the Effective Time is to occur (the " **Closing Date** ").

  



  

 **ARTICLE 3** 
 Conversion of the Company Shares; Cash Election; Exchange of Certificates

  



  

Section 3.01. _Conversion of the Company Shares_. At the Effective Time by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of
shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent:

  



  

(a) each issued Company Share owned by the Company (other than shares held
for the account of clients, customers or other Persons) or owned by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares held for the account of clients, customers or other Persons) shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;

  



  

(b) each Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.06 or as
adjusted pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii), be converted into the following
(collectively, the " **Merger Consideration** "):

  



  

(i) for each such Company Share with respect to which an election to receive
cash has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed converted into the
right to receive the Stock Election Price pursuant to Section 3.03(b), or is
deemed made pursuant to Section 3.03(d), as the case may be (each, a " **Cash
Electing Company Share** "), the right to receive an amount equal to $23.50
in cash without interest (the " **Cash Election Price** "); and

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) for each other such Company Share, the right to receive 0.6033 share(s)
(the " **Exchange Ratio** ") of common stock, par value $2.00 per share ("
**Parent Stock** "), of the Parent (the " **Stock Election Price** ") as may
be adjusted pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii).

  



  

Section 3.02. _Elections._ Each person (other than the Company) who, at the
close of business on the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting or on
such other date as the Parent and the Company publicly announce as the
Election Date (such date, the " **Election Date** "), is a record holder of
Company Shares will be entitled, with respect to any or all of such Company
Shares, to make an election (a " **Cash Election** ") on or prior to such
date to receive the Cash Election Price on the basis hereinafter set forth.
No such person shall be entitled to make a Cash Election with respect to
Dissenters Shares. Dissenters Shares held by shareholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost
their rights to appraisal of such shares under Virginia Law shall thereupon
be deemed to have made a Cash Election with respect to such Dissenters
Shares.

  



  

Section 3.03. _Proration of Election Price_. (a) Subject to adjustment
pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii), the number of Company Shares to be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Price at the
Effective Time shall not be less than the number of Company Shares which is
equal to (i) 34% of the Company Shares outstanding at the Effective Time
(excluding any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.01(a))
minus (ii) the number of Dissenters Shares at the Effective Time (such
difference, the " **Minimum Cash Election Number** ") and shall not exceed
the number of Company Shares which is equal to (i) 50% of the Company
Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (excluding any Company Shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 3.01(a)) minus (ii) the number of Dissenters
Shares at the Effective Time (such difference, the " **Maximum Cash
Election Number** ").

  



  

(b) If the number of Cash Electing Company Shares exceeds the Maximum Cash
Election Number, then such Cash Electing Company Shares shall be treated in
the following manner:

  



  

(i) A cash proration factor (the " **Cash Proration Factor** ") shall be
determined by dividing (x) the Maximum Cash Election Number by (y) the total
number of Cash Electing Company Shares.

  



  

(ii) A number of Cash Electing Company Shares covered by each shareholders
Cash Election equal to the product of (x) the Cash Proration Factor and (y)
the total number of Cash Electing Company Shares covered by such Cash
Election shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election
Price.

  



  

(iii) Each Cash Electing Company Share, other than those Company Shares
converted into the right to receive the Cash Election

  



        
   

  



  

Price in accordance with Section 3.03(b)(ii), shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Election Price as if such Company Shares were not
Cash Electing Company Shares.

  



  

(c) If the number of Cash Electing Company Shares is greater than or equal to
the Minimum Cash Election Number and less than or equal to the Maximum Cash
Election Number, then each Cash Electing Company Share shall be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Election Price and each other Company
Share (other than Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.01(a)
and other than Dissenters Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Election Price.

  



  

(d) If the number of Cash Electing Company Shares is less than the Minimum
Cash Election Number, then:

  



  

(i) Each Cash Electing Company Share shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Price.

  



  

(ii) The Company Shares as to which a Cash Election is not in effect,
excluding Company Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.01(a), (the "
**Non-Electing Company Shares** ") shall be treated in the following manner:

  



  

(A) A stock proration factor (the " **Stock Proration Factor** ") shall
be determined by dividing (x) the difference between the Minimum Cash
Election Number and the number of Cash Electing Company Shares, by (y) the
total number of Non-Electing Company Shares.

  



  

(B) A number of Non-Electing Company Shares of each shareholder equal to the
product of (x) the Stock Proration Factor and (y) the total number of Non-
Electing Company Shares of such shareholder shall be converted into the right
to receive the Cash Election Price (and a Cash Election shall be deemed to
have been made with respect to such Company Shares).

  



  

(C) Each Non-Electing Company Share of each shareholder as to which a Cash
Election is not deemed made pursuant to Section 3.03(d)(ii)(B) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Election Price.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
not be required to issue in excess of 2,500,000 shares of Parent Stock
pursuant to this Article 3. If Parent would be required to issue in excess
of 2,500,000 shares of Parent Stock after application of the applicable
proration provisions of Section 3.03, the Minimum Cash Election Number shall
be increased to the extent necessary to provide that the number of shares of
Parent

  



        
   

  



  

Stock issued after application of the applicable proration provisions of
Section 3.03 does not exceed 2,500,000 shares of Parent Stock.

  



  

Section 3.04. _Election Procedures; Exchange Agent._ (a) Prior to the date of
the Company Shareholder Meeting (as defined in Section 7.02), Parent and the
Company shall prepare a form (an " **Election Form** ") pursuant to which a
holder of record of Company Shares may make a Cash Election with respect to
each Company Share owned by such holder. The Company shall cause an Election
Form and a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in
exchanging certificates representing Company Shares (the " **Certificates**
") for the Merger Consideration to be included with the Company Proxy
Statement (as defined in Section 5.09(a)) and mailed to each holder of record
of Company Shares as of the record date for such meeting.

  



  

(b) Prior to the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting, Parent shall
appoint an agent independent of and unaffiliated with Parent or the Company
(the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the purpose of (i) receiving Election Forms
and determining, in accordance with this Article 3, the form of
Merger Consideration to be received by each holder of Company Shares, and
(ii) exchanging for the Merger Consideration (A) Certificates or (B)
uncertificated Company Shares (the " **Uncertificated Shares** "). At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates
and the Uncertificated Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article
3, (i) subject to Section 3.05(a), certificates representing the shares of
Parent Stock that constitute the stock portion of the Merger Consideration
and (ii) an amount of cash necessary to satisfy the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration (the " **Exchange Fund** "). At the Effective Time or
promptly thereafter, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each holder of record of Company Shares which have not previously
been delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.05(a) at the
Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use
in such exchange.

  



  

(c) A Cash Election shall be effective only if the Exchange Agent shall have
received no later than 5:00 p.m. Baltimore, Maryland time on the date of the
Company Shareholder Meeting (the " **Election Deadline** ") (i) an Election
Form covering the Company Shares to which such Cash Election applies,
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions set forth in such
Election Form and (ii) Certificates, in such form and with such endorsements,
stock powers and signature guarantees as may be required by such Election
Form or the letter of transmittal. Any Company Share with respect to which
the Exchange Agent has not received an effective Cash Election meeting the
requirements of this Section 3.04(c) by the Election Deadline shall be deemed
to be a Non-Electing Company Share.  A Cash Election may be revoked or
changed only by delivering to the

  



        
   

  



  

Exchange Agent, prior to the Election Deadline, a written notice
of revocation or, in the case of a change, a properly completed revised
Election Form that identifies the Company Shares to which such revised
Election Form applies. Delivery to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election
Deadline of a revised Election Form with respect to any Company Shares shall
result in the revocation of all prior Election Forms with respect to all such
Company Shares. Any termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article
11 shall result in the revocation of all Election Forms delivered to the
Exchange Agent on or prior to the date of such termination.

  



  

(d) The Company and Parent shall have the right to make rules, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity and
effectiveness of Election Forms and letters of transmittal.

  



  

Section 3.05 _. Exchange Procedures; Surrender and Payment. _(a) Each holder
of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Shares represented
by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The shares of Parent Stock
constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at Parents option, shall be
in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested
by a holder of Company Shares or is otherwise required under applicable law.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.04(b) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Company Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Company Shares
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.05 prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for
any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent
constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 3.09, shall be paid to the holder of
any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered
or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section.  Following
such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, (i) at
the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.09 and the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date
of such surrender with respect to such securities, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to surrender or
transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or transfer payable
with respect to such securities.

  



  

Section 3.06 _. Dissenters Shares. _Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by shareholders
who shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who shall have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Virginia Law (collectively, the " **Dissenters  Shares**")
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and such shareholders instead shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such shares held by them in accordance with
the provisions Virginia Law; _provided_  that all Dissenters Shares held by
shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under
Virginia Law shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to
have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the Cash Election Price upon surrender in the
manner provided in Section 3.05 of the Certificates that, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, evidenced such shares, subject to proration in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.03 hereof.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 3.07 _. Stock Options. _ At the Effective Time, each Company
Option issued and outstanding at the Effective Time under the Company Option
Plans, shall be converted into and become options to purchase Parent Stock.
Parent shall assume each Company Option in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Company Option Plan pursuant to which it was issued, the
agreements evidencing grants thereunder and any other agreements between the
Company and an optionee regarding Company Options; _provided_ , however, that
any agreement providing for a tax payment to an optionee upon exercise shall
be amended prior to the Effective Date to remove such tax payment provision
if each option subject to such agreement shall not have been exercised prior
to the Effective Date; and, provided, further however, that from and after
the Effective Time, each such Company Option shall be exercisable solely for
Parent Stock; the number of shares of Parent Stock which may be acquired
pursuant to such Company Option shall be the number of Company Shares subject
to such Company Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole share; and the exercise price per Company Share shall be equal
to the exercise price per Company Share divided by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest cent. It is intended that the
foregoing assumption and adjustment shall be effected in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code, as to each Company Option
which is an incentive stock option.

  



  

Section 3.08 _. Adjustments.  _If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, (i) any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur, including by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares, in each case whether by merger or otherwise or
(ii) any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period shall
occur, the Merger Consideration, the maximum number of shares of Parent Stock
issuable hereunder, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
and, if applicable, the Cash Election Price, Exchange Ratio and their
determination shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

Section 3.09 _. Fractional Shares. _No fractional shares of Parent Stock
shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a
holder of Company Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result
of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such
aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an
amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying the closing sale
price of a share of Parent Stock on the NASDAQ National Market, as reported
in the New York City edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ , on the trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Time by the fraction of a share of Parent
Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

  



  

Section 3.10 _. Withholding Rights. _Each of the Exchange Agent, Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Section 3.10
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. If the

  



        
   

  



  

Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares in
respect of which the Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  



  

Section 3.11 _. Lost Certificates. _If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Company Share represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Section 3.11.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 4**

the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company Regulatory
Document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each such Company
Regulatory Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of

based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by Parent
specifically for use therein.

which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Each Subsidiary of Parent is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such

respective jurisdictions of incorporation are identified in the Parent 10-K.

(b) As of its filing date, each Parent SEC Document complied, and each such
Parent SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will comply, as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933
Act and 1934 Act, as the case may be.

  



  

(c) As of its filing date, each Parent SEC Document filed pursuant to the
1934 Act did not, and each such Parent SEC Document filed subsequent to the
date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  



  

(d) Each Parent SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date
such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

  



        
   

  



  

(e) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating
to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to
Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by
others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the
periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being prepared. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parents
principal executive officer and principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parents periodic reports required
under the 1934 Act.

  



  

(f) Parent and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act). Such internal controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of Parent financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP.  Parent has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to Parents
auditors and audit committee (x) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in internal controls. Parent has made available to
the Company a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the
Companys auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2005.

  



  

(g) Parent has not since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, taken any
action prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. All outstanding
extensions of credit, if any, were at the time they were made and continue to
be permitted and in compliance with the provisions of Regulation O, 12 C.F.R.
Part 215.

  



  

(h) Since January 1, 2003, Parent and each of the Parent
Banking Subsidiaries has timely filed all required annual and
quarterly statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) required to be filed with EDS, the banking
agencies electronic collection agent (collectively, the " **Parent** **RAP
Statements** "). The Parent RAP Statements, including the method for
determining Parents and the Parent Banking Subsidiaries provision for loan
and lease losses, are and have been prepared in conformity with regulatory
accounting practices, applicable law and supervisory policy, consistently
applied, for the periods covered thereby and (as may have been amended and
restated or supplemented by Parent RAP Statements filed subsequently but
prior to the date hereof) fairly present in all material respects the
statutory financial position of Parent and the Parent Banking Subsidiaries,
as at the respective dates thereof and the results of operations of Parent
and the Parent Banking Subsidiaries for the respective periods then ended. The
Parent RAP

  



        
   

  



  

Statements comply in all material respects with any requirement of law when
filed and no material deficiency has been asserted with respect to any Parent
RAP Statements by the FDIC or any other governmental authority. The annual
statutory balance sheets and income statements included in the Parent RAP
Statements have been audited, and the Parent has made available to the
Company true and complete copies of all audit opinions related thereto.
Neither Parents or the Parent Banking Subsidiaries independent public
accountants nor any employee of the Parent or the Parent Banking
Subsidiaries has alleged that any of the Parent RAP Statements contains any
misstatement or other defect which, if true, would cause the representations
and warranties contained in this Section 6.07(h) to be untrue.

  



  

Section 6.08 _. Financial Statements. _The audited consolidated
financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents fairly present, in all
material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial
position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods
then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements).

  



  

Section 6.09 _. Disclosure Documents. _(a) None of the information provided
by Parent for inclusion in the Company Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto, at the time the Company Proxy Statement or any amendment
or supplement thereto is first mailed to shareholders of the Company and at
the time the shareholders vote on adoption of this Agreement and at
the Effective Time, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

  



  

(b) The Registration Statement of Parent to be filed with the SEC with
respect to the offering of Parent Stock in connection with the Merger (the "
**Registration Statement** ") and any amendments or supplements thereto, when
filed, will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the 1933 Act. At the time the Registration Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto becomes effective and at the Effective Time, the
Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this
Section 6.09 will not apply to statements or omissions in the Registration
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto based upon information
furnished to Parent by the Company specifically for use therein.

  



  

Section 6.10 _. Absence of Certain Changes. _Since the Parent Balance
Sheet Date, the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice and, except as disclosed to
the

  



        
   

  



  

Company and as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof, there has not been:

  



  

(a) any event, occurrence, development or state of circumstances or facts

distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of Parent other than

ordinary course, or any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries of any outstanding shares of capital stock or
other securities of, or other ownership interests in, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries; and

  



  

(c) any change in any material method of accounting or accounting practice by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for any such change required by
reason of a concurrent change in GAAP or Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act.

  



  

Section 6.11 _. No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. _There are no liabilities
or obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind
whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable
or otherwise, and there is no existing condition, situation or set of
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in such a
liability, other than:

  



  

(a) liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the Parent
Balance Sheet or in the notes thereto or in the Parent SEC Documents filed
prior to the date hereof; and

  



  

(b) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  



  

Section 6.12 _. Compliance with Laws and Court Orders. _Parent and each of
its Subsidiaries is and, since January 1, 2004, has been in compliance with,
and to the knowledge of Parent is not under investigation with respect to and
has not been threatened to be charged with or given notice of any violation

in employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate, to
the same extent that similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries participate; _provided, however_ , that Parent may instead
continue the Employee Benefit Plans for the benefit of such employees or
provide such employees with participation in the employee benefit plans of
Parent or its Subsidiaries on a basis that is no less favorable to such
employees than those Employee Benefit Plans in which they participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time (it being understood that inclusion
of Company Employees in Parents employee benefit plans may occur
at different times with respect to different plans). Following the Effective
Time, the Company Employees, upon executing an appropriate release in the
form reasonably determined by Parent, shall be eligible to receive upon
involuntary termination, if such termination occurs within one year after the
Effective Time, severance benefits substantially upon the terms set forth in
Section 9.10(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b) With respect to each Parent plan for which length of service is taken
into account for any purpose, service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be treated as service with Parent for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits,
including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for
accrual of defined benefit pension benefits);  _provided, however_ , that
such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits.  Such service also shall apply
for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition limitations.
Each Parent plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same
extent waived or to the extent that they do not apply under the applicable
Company plan. Company Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under
a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for purposes of applying
deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent plan.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor and shall cause
the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent to assume and to honor in accordance
with their terms all employment agreements, copies of which have been
provided to Parent. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Merger will
constitute a "change in control" of the Company for all purposes under such
agreements. Not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent acknowledges and
agrees that the Merger will result in, and agrees that it shall pay at the
Effective Time, the change in control payment set forth in the Companys
existing employment agreement with Richard I. Linhart, if the Effective Time
occurs prior to April 30, 2007 (notwithstanding the prior expiration of such
agreement).

  



        
   

  



  

(d) Parent and Company agree that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company
in consultation with and subject to the approval of Parent, may adopt a
retention plan (the " **Retention Plan** ") which may include a retention pool
of not more than $200,000. The design or beneficiaries of such Retention
Plan shall be determined by mutual agreement between Parent and Company.

  



  

Section 9.11 _. Bank Merger Agreement._

  



  

(a) Immediately after the execution and delivery of the Bank Merger
Agreement, (i) Parent shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement as the sole
stockholder of Parent Bank and (ii) the Company shall approve the Bank Merger
Agreement as the sole shareholder of the Company Bank.

  



  

(b) The Company and Parent may revise the sequence of events or other
procedural matters relating to the consummation of the Merger and the Bank
Merger in such manner as they may reasonably determine will best facilitate
consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger; _provided_ , that any action
taken pursuant to this Section shall not (i) alter or change the kind or
amount of consideration to be issued to the holders of the Company Shares as
provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax consequences of
the Merger to the holders of the Company Shares or (iii) otherwise cause any
closing condition not to be capable of being fulfilled (unless duly waived by
the party entitled to the benefits thereof).

  



  

Section 9.12 _. Company Options. _As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to holders of Company Options which have
been converted into options to acquire Parent Stock in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.05 hereof, a notice setting forth a statement of the
modified terms thereof. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall file
a registration statement on Form S-8, or on such other form as may be
appropriate, with respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject to such
options, and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement or statements for so long as such options
remain outstanding.

  



  

Section 9.13 _. Prohibited Purchases or Sales. _Neither Parent, the Company or
the Company Subsidiary shall purchase or sell on the NASDAQ National Market,
or submit a bid to purchase or an offer to sell on the NASDAQ National
Market, directly or indirectly, any shares of Parent Stock or any options,
warrants, rights or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of Parent Stock during the 10 consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the Determination Date; _provided_ that the foregoing restriction
shall not be applicable to (i) purchases or sales of Parent Stock held by
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent in trust, managed, custodial or nominee
accounts and the like, or held by mutual funds, (ii) shares acquired in
respect of debts previously contracted, (iii) purchases of Parent Stock to
fund Parents obligations under its dividend reinvestment plan or its
employee stock purchase plan in accordance with past practice or (iv)

  



        
   

  



  

purchases or sales of Parent Stock to satisfy Parents tax withholding
obligations with respect to grants of restricted stock to employees.

of this Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by
such time;

  



  

(ii) (A) there shall be any law that makes consummation of the Merger illegal
or otherwise prohibited or (B) any judgment, injunction,

  



        
   

  



  

order or decree of any court or governmental body having competent

entered and such judgment, injunction, judgment or order shall have become
final and nonappealable; or

  



  

(iii) this Agreement and the Plan of Merger shall not have been approved and
adopted in accordance with the VSCA by the Companys shareholders at the
Company Shareholder Meeting (or any adjournment thereof);

  



  

(c) by Parent if:

  



  

(i) as permitted by Section 7.03(b)(iii), the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have failed to make or withdrawn, or modified in a manner
adverse to Parent, its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the
Plan of Merger;

  



  

(ii) the Company shall have entered into, or publicly announced its intention
to enter into, a definitive agreement or an agreement in principle with
respect to a Superior Proposal; or

  



  

(iii) (A) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in
Section 10.02(a) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of
being satisfied by the End Date or (B) the Company shall have willfully and
materially breached its obligations under Sections 7.02 and 7.03; or

  



  

(d) by the Company, if:

  



  

(i) the Board of Directors of the Company authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a written agreement
concerning a Superior Proposal; _provided_  that the Company shall have paid
any amounts due pursuant to Section 12.04(b) in accordance with the terms,
and at the times, specified therein, and _provided, further,_ that, in the

Proposal, attaching the most current version of such agreement (or a
description of all material terms and conditions thereof), and (B) Parent
does not make, within 72 hours of receipt of such written notification, an
offer that is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as
such Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Company shall not enter
into any such binding agreement during such 72-hour period; or

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Parent set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section
10.03(a) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being
satisfied by the End Date.

  



  

(iii) during the three-day period following the Determination Date:

  



  

(1) the Average Closing Price shall be less than the product of 0.85 and the
Starting Price; and

  



  

(2) (a) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the "
**Parent Ratio** ") shall be less than (b) the number obtained by dividing
the Index Price on the Determination Date by the Index Price on the date of
this Agreement and subtracting 0.15 from such quotient (such number being
referred to herein as the " **Index Ratio** "),

  



  

subject to the following provisions of this Section 11.01(d)(iii). If the
Company elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written notice of such election to
Parent. During the three-day period (the " **Decision Period** ") commencing
with its receipt of such notice, Parent may elect to pay, as additional
Merger Consideration in accordance with Article 3, to each holder of Company
Shares that, after the application of Section 3.03, are converted into the
right to receive Parent Stock as provided in Article 3, additional shares of
Parent Stock and/or cash in an amount per each such Company Share equal to
the Top-Up Amount. The Top-Up Amount shall be paid (A) in shares of Parent
Stock valued for this purpose at the Average Closing Price; _provided_ that
Parent shall not be required to issue in excess of 2,500,000 shares of Parent
Stock in the aggregate as Merger Consideration (including any shares issued
as Top-Up Amount) and (B) to the extent any Top-Up Amount is not paid
pursuant to clause (A) above, such remaining Top-Up Amount shall be paid in
cash; _provided_  further that the portion of the Top-Up Amount paid in cash
shall not be an amount that would cause the failure of the conditions set
forth in Section 10.02(d) and Section 10.03(b) hereof and, in the event this
limitation prevents Parent from fully paying the Top-Up Amount, the Company
shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Section
11.01(d)(iii) notwithstanding any election by Parent to pay the Top-Up
Amount. All payments of Top-Up Amounts, if any, shall be made as payments of
additional Merger Consideration as provided in accordance with Article 3 but
shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, be subject to Section 3.03.

  



        
   

  



  

The " **Top-Up Amount** " shall be the number obtained by multiplying (A) the
Average Closing Price by (B) the excess of the Imputed Exchange Ratio over
the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

The " **Imputed Exchange Ratio** " shall equal the lesser of:

  



  

(x) the number obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Starting Price
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio multiplied by 0.85 by (B) the
Average Closing Price; and

  



  

(y) the number obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Index Ratio and
the Exchange Ratio by (B) the Parent Ratio.

  



  

If Parent makes such election within the Decision Period, it shall
give prompt written notice to the Company of such election and the Top-Up
Amount, whereupon the Company shall have no right to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11.01(d)(iii) and this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  



  

If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Determination Date, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock
of Parent shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the "Starting Price" shall be appropriately adjusted to
account for such change for the purposes of this Section 11.01(d)(iii).

  



  

For purposes of this Section 11.01(d)(iii), the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated below:

  



  

" **Average Closing Price** " means the average of the last reported sale
prices per share of Parent Stock as reported on the NASDAQ/NMS (as reported
in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company) for the
10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date.

  



  

" **Determination Date** " means the date which is the seventh calendar day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, or if such calendar day is not a

Bank Index.

  



  

" **NASDAQ/NMS** " means the NASDAQ Stock Markets National Market.

(other than pursuant to Section 11.01(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

  



  

Section 11.02 _. Effect of Termination. _If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement shall become void and of
no effect without liability of any party (or any shareholder, stockholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such
party) to the other party hereto; _provided_  that, if such termination
shall result from the willful (i) failure of either party to fulfill a
condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party or (ii)
failure of either party to perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be
fully liable for any and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by
the other party as a result of such failure. The provisions of this Section
11.02 and Sections 9.07, 12.04, 12.07, 12.08 and 12.09 shall survive any

[Form of Plan of Merger]

        
   

  



  

 **EXHIBIT A**

  



  

 **PLAN OF MERGER**

  



  

merging

  



  

 **JAMES MONROE BANCORP, INC., 
**a Virginia corporation

  



  

with and into

  



  

 **MERCANTILE BANKSHARES CORPORATION, 
** a Maryland corporation

  



  

1. _Merger_. James Monroe Bancorp, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the " **Merged Corporation** "), shall, upon the effective time and date set forth in the articles of merger to be filed with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia (such time being referred to herein as the " **Effective Time** "), be merged (the " **Merger** ") with and into Mercantile Bankshares Corporation, a Maryland corporation (" **Parent** "). Parent shall be, and shall continue as, the surviving corporation (the " **Surviving Corporation** ") in the Merger, and the separate corporate existence of the Merged Corporation shall cease.

  



  

2. _Effects of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 13.1-721 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act and Section 3-114 of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Parent and the Merged Corporation shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Parent and the Merged Corporation shall be the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

 _3._ _ Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws._

  



  

(a) The articles of incorporation of Parent in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law.

  



  

(b) The bylaws of Parent in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance
with applicable law.

  



  

4. _Board of Directors._ The directors of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

        
   

  



  

5. _Officers._ The officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

6. _Manner and Basis of Converting Securities._ As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of capital stock of Parent or the Merged Corporation:

  



  

(a) Conversion of Shares of Common Stock of the Merged Corporation.

  



  

(i) Each share of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share of Merged
Corporation (the " **Merged Shares** "), owned by the Merged Corporation
(other than shares held for the account of clients, customers or other
persons) or owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares held for the account of clients,
customers or other persons) shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.

  



  

(ii) Each Merged Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 6(a)(i) or Section 6(e) or as
adjusted pursuant to Section 9(a) herein, be converted into the following
(the " **Merger Consideration** "):

  



  

(A) for each such Merged Share with respect to which an election to receive
cash has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed converted into the
right to receive the Stock Election Price (as defined herein) pursuant to
Section 6(c)(ii), or is deemed made pursuant to Section 6(c)(iv), as the case
may be (each, a " **Cash Electing Merged Share** "), the right to receive an
amount equal to $23.50 in cash without interest (the " **Cash Election Price**
"); and

  



  

(B) for each other such Merged Share, the right to receive 0.6033 share(s)
(the " **Exchange Ratio** ") of common stock, par value $2.00 per share ("
**Parent Stock** "), of the Parent (the " **Stock Election Price** "), as may
be adjusted pursuant to Section 9(a) herein.

  



  

(b) Elections. Each person (other than the Merged Corporation) who, at the
close of business on the date of the Merged Corporations Shareholder Meeting
(as defined below) or on such other date as Parent and the Merged Corporation
publicly announce as the election date (such

  



        
   

  



  

date, the " **Election Date** "), is a record holder of Merged Shares will be
entitled, with respect to any or all of such Merged Shares, to make an
election (a " **Cash Election** ") on or prior to such date to receive the
Cash Election Price on the basis hereinafter set forth. No such person shall
be entitled to make a Cash Election with respect to Dissenters Shares (as
defined below). Dissenters Shares held by shareholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost their
rights to appraisal of such shares under Virginia Law shall thereupon be
deemed to have made a Cash Election with respect to such Dissenters Shares.

  



  

(c) Proration of Election Price.

  



  

(i) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 9(a), the number of Merged
Shares to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Price at
the Effective Time shall not be less than the number of Merged Shares which
is equal to (i) 34% of the Merged Shares outstanding at the Effective Time
(excluding any Merged Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 6(a)(i))
minus (ii) the number of Dissenters Shares at the Effective Time (such
difference, the " **Minimum Cash Election Number** ") and shall not exceed
the number of Merged Shares which is equal to (i) 50% of the Merged
Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (excluding any Merged Shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 6(a)(i)) minus (ii) the number of
Dissenters Shares at the Effective Time (such difference, the " **Maximum
Cash Election Number** ").

  



  

(ii) If the number of Cash Electing Merged Shares exceeds the Maximum Cash
Election Number, then such Cash Electing Merged Shares shall be treated in
the following manner:

  



  

(A) a cash proration factor (the " **Cash Proration Factor** ") shall be
determined by dividing (x) the Maximum Cash Election Number by (y) the total
number of Cash Electing Merged Shares;

  



  

(B) a number of Cash Electing Merged Shares covered by each shareholders
Cash Election equal to the product of (x) the Cash Proration Factor and (y)
the total number of Cash Electing Merged Shares covered by such Cash Election
shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Price; and

  



  

(C) each Cash Electing Merged Share, other than those Merged Shares converted
into the right to receive the Cash Election Price in accordance with

  



        
   

  



  

Section 6(c)(ii)(B), shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Election Price as if such Merged Shares were not Cash Electing Merged Shares.

  



  

(iii) If the number of Cash Electing Merged Shares is greater than or equal
to the Minimum Cash Election Number and less than or equal to the Maximum
Cash Election Number, then each Cash Electing Merged Share shall be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Election Price and each other Merged Share
(other than Merged Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 6(a)(i)
and other than Dissenters Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Election Price.

  



  

(iv) If the number of Cash Electing Merged Shares is less than the Minimum
Cash Election Number, then:

  



  

(A) each Cash Electing Merged Share shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Price; and

  



  

(B) the Merged Shares as to which a Cash Election is not in effect, excluding
Merged Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 6(a)(i), (the " **Non-
Electing Merged Shares** ") shall be treated in the following manner:

  



  

(1) a stock proration factor (the " **Stock Proration Factor** ") shall be
determined by dividing (x) the difference between the Minimum Cash Election
Number and the number of Cash Electing Merged Shares, by (y) the total number
of Non-Electing Merged Shares;

  



  

(2) A number of Non-Electing Merged Shares of each shareholder equal to the
product of (x) the Stock Proration Factor and (y) the total number of Non-
Electing Merged Shares of such shareholder shall be converted into the right
to receive the Cash Election Price (and a Cash Election shall be deemed to
have been made with respect to such Merged Shares); and

  



  

(3) Each Non-Electing Merged Share of each shareholder as to which a Cash
Election is not deemed made pursuant to Section 6(c)(iv)(B)(2) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Election Price.

  



        
   

  



  

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Plan of Merger to the contrary, Parent
shall not be required to issue in excess of 2,500,000 shares of Parent Stock
pursuant to this Section 6. If Parent would be required to issue in excess of
2,500,000 shares of Parent Stock after application of the applicable
proration provisions of Section 6(c), the Minimum Cash Election Number shall
be increased to the extent necessary to provide that the number of shares of
Parent Stock issued after application of the applicable proration provisions
of Section 6(c) does not exceed 2,500,000 shares of Parent Stock

  



  

(d) _Fractional Shares._ No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued
in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a holder of Merged
Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall
be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such
holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash
without interest determined by multiplying the closing sale price of a share
of Parent Stock on the NASDAQ National Market, as reported in the New York
City edition of The Wall Street Journal, on the trading day immediately
preceding the Effective Time by the fraction of a share of Parent Stock to
which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

  



  

(e) _Dissenters  Shares. _Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan
of Merger to the contrary, Merged Shares that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by shareholders who shall not
have voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance
with Virginia Law (collectively, the " **Dissenters  Shares**") shall not
be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
and such shareholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions
of Virginia Law; _provided_  that all Dissenters Shares held by shareholders
who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or
otherwise lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under Virginia Law
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any
interest thereon, the Cash Election Price upon surrender in the manner
provided in Section 8 of the Certificates that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, evidenced such shares, subject to proration in accordance
with the provisions of Section 6(c) hereof.

  



  

(f) _Stock Options._ At the Effective Time, each option (each, a " **Merged
Corporation Option** ") granted by the Merged Corporation to purchase Merged
Shares pursuant to the Merged Corporations 1998 Management Incentive Stock
Option Plan, the 1999 Directors Stock

  



        
   

  



  

Option Plan and the 2003 Equity Compensation Plan (collectively, the "
**Merged Corporation Option Plans** "), issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time under the Merged Corporation Option Plans, shall be converted
into and become options to purchase Parent Stock. Parent shall assume each
Merged Corporation Option in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Merged Corporation Option Plan pursuant to which it was issued,
the agreements of evidencing grants thereunder and any other agreements
between the Merged Corporation and an optionee regarding Merged Corporation
Options; provided, however, that any agreement providing for a tax payment to
an optionee upon exercise shall be amended prior to the Effective Date to
remove such tax payment provision if each option subject to such agreement
shall not have been exercised prior to the Effective Time; and, provided,
further however, that from and after the Effective Time, each such Merged
Corporation Option shall be exercisable solely for Parent Stock; the number
of shares of Parent Stock which may be acquired pursuant to such Merged
Corporation Option shall be the number of Merged Shares subject to such
Merged Corporation Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole share; and the exercise price per Merged Share shall be
equal to the exercise price per Merged Share divided by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest cent. It is intended that the foregoing
assumption and adjustment shall be effected in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code, as to each Merged Corporation Option
which is an incentive stock option.

  



  

7. Election Procedures; Exchange Agent.

  



  

(a) Prior to the date of the meeting of the Merged Corporations shareholders
held for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of the Plan of
Merger (the " **Merged Corporation s Shareholder Meeting**"), Parent and
the Merged Corporation shall prepare a form (an " **Election Form** ")
pursuant to which a holder of record of Merged Shares may make a Cash
Election with respect to each Merged Share owned by such holder. The Merged
Corporation shall cause an Election Form and a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in exchanging
certificates representing Merged Shares (the " **Certificates** ") for the
Merger Consideration to be included with the Merged Corporations
proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Comission in
connection with the Merger and mailed to each holder of record of Merged
Shares as of the record date for such meeting.

  



  

(b) Prior to the record date for the Merged Corporations Shareholder
Meeting, Parent shall appoint an agent (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the
purpose of (i) receiving Election Forms and determining, in accordance with
this Section 7, the form of Merger Consideration to be received by each
holder of Merged Shares, and (ii) exchanging for the

  



        
   

  



  

Merger Consideration (A) Certificates or (B) uncertificated Merged Shares
(the " **Uncertificated Shares** "). At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares,
for exchange in accordance with this Section 7, (i) subject to Section 8(a),
certificates representing the shares of Parent Stock that constitute the
stock portion of the Merger Consideration and (ii) an amount of cash
necessary to satisfy the cash portion of the Merger Consideration (the "
**Exchange Fund** "). At the Effective Time or promptly thereafter, Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
record of Merged Shares which have not previously been delivered to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 7(a) at the Effective Time, a letter
of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  



  

(c) A Cash Election shall be effective only if the Exchange Agent shall have
received no later than 5:00 p.m. Baltimore, Maryland time on the date of the
Merged Corporations Shareholder Meeting (the " **Election Deadline** ") (i)
an Election Form covering the Merged Shares to which such Cash Election
applies, executed and completed in accordance with the instructions set forth
in such Election Form, and (ii) Certificates, in such form and with such
endorsements, stock powers and signature guarantees as may be required by
such Election Form or the letter of transmittal. Any Merged Share with
respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective Cash
Election meeting the requirements of this Section 7(c) by the Election
Deadline shall be deemed to be a Non-Electing Merged Share. A Cash Election
may be revoked or changed only by delivering to the Exchange Agent, prior to
the Election Deadline, a written notice of revocation or, in the case of a
change, a properly completed revised Election Form that identifies the Merged
Shares to which such revised Election Form applies. Delivery to the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline of a revised Election Form with respect
to any Merged Shares shall result in the revocation of all prior Election
Forms with respect to all such Merged Shares.

  



  

(d) The Merged Corporation and Parent shall have the right to make rules,
not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan of Merger, governing the
validity and effectiveness of Election Forms and letters of transmittal.

  



  

 _8._ _ Exchange Procedures; Surrender and Payment._

  



  

(a) Each holder of Merged Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents

  



        
   

  



  

message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Merged Shares represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The
shares of Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at
Parents option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a
physical certificate is requested by a holder of Merged Shares or
is otherwise required under applicable law. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person
other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Merged Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

  



  

(d) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 7(b) that remains unclaimed by the holders
of Merged Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Merged Shares
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 8(d) prior
to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the
Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect
thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
Merged Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of
Parent constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 6(d), shall be paid to
the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated
Shares not transferred until such Certificates or

  



        
   

  



  

Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as
provided in this Section. Following such surrender or transfer, there
shall be paid, without interest, to the person in whose name the securities
of Parent have been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or
transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to
which such person is entitled pursuant to Section 6(d) and the amount of all
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such
securities, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior
to surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or
transfer payable with respect to such securities.

  



  

 _9._ _ Adjustments._

  



  

(a) If, during the three-day period following the Determination Date:

  



  

(1) the Average Closing Price shall be less than the product of 0.85 and
the Starting Price; and

  



  

(2) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the " **Parent
Ratio** ") shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Index
Price on the Determination Date by the Index Price on the date of the Merger
Agreement and subtracting 0.15 from such quotient (such number being referred
to herein as the " **Index Ratio** "),

  



  

subject to the following provisions of this Section 9(a), the Merged
Corporation may elect to exercise its termination right pursuant to the
Merger Agreement and shall give prompt written notice of such election to
Parent. During the three-day period (the " **Decision Period** ") commencing
with its receipt of such notice, Parent may elect to pay, as additional
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 6, to each holder of Merged
Shares that, after the application of Section 6(c), are converted into the
right to receive Parent Stock as provided in Section 6, additional shares of
Parent Stock and/or cash in an amount per each such Merged Share equal to the
Top-Up Amount. The Top-Up Amount shall be paid (A) in shares of Parent Stock
valued for this purpose at the Average Closing Price; _provided_ that Parent
shall not be required to issue in excess of 2,500,000 shares of Parent Stock
in the aggregate as Merger Consideration (including any shares issued as Top-
Up Amount) and (B) to the extent any Top-Up Amount is not paid pursuant to
clause (A) above,

  



        
   

  



  

such remaining Top-Up Amount shall be paid in cash; _provided_ further that
the portion of the Top-Up Amount paid in cash shall not be an amount that
would cause the failure of the Termination Conditions (as defined below) and,
in the event this limitation prevents Parent from fully paying the Top-
Up Amount, the Merged Corporation shall be entitled to terminate this Plan
of Merger in accordance with this Section 9(a) notwithstanding any election
by Parent to pay the Top-Up Amount. All payments of Top-Up Amounts, if any,
shall be made as payments of additional Merger Consideration as provided in
accordance with Section 6 but shall not, for the avoidance of doubt,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

The undersigned has been advised that, as of the date of this letter,
the undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of James Monroe Bancorp,
Inc., a Virginia corporation (the " **Company** "), as the term "affiliate"
is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules
and regulations (the " **Rules and Regulations**") of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " **SEC** ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " **1933 Act** "). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of March 27, 2006 (the " **Merger Agreement** ")
between the Company and Mercantile Bankshares Corporation, a Maryland
corporation (" **Parent** "), the Company will be merged with and into
Parent, with Parent the surviving corporation in the merger (the " **Merger**
").

  



  

As a result of the Merger, the undersigned may receive shares of common
stock, par value $2.00 per share, of Parent (" **Parent Common Shares**
") in exchange for shares owned by the undersigned of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the " **Company Common Stock** ").

  



  

The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to Parent and the Company
that, as of the date the undersigned receives any Parent Common Shares as a
result of the Merger:

  



  

A. The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of
the Parent Common Shares in violation of the 1933 Act or the Rules and
Regulations.

  



  

B. The undersigned has carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement
and discussed, to the extent the undersigned felt necessary with the
undersigneds counsel or counsel for the Company, the requirements of such
documents and other applicable limitations upon the undersigneds ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Shares.

        
   

  



  

C. The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Shares
to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the SEC
under the 1933 Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. The undersigned
has also been advised that, because, at the time the Merger is submitted for
a vote of the shareholders of the Company, the undersigned may be deemed an
affiliate of the Company, the undersigned may not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of Parent Common Shares issued to the undersigned in the Merger
unless such sale, transfer or other disposition (i) has been registered under
the 1933 Act, (ii) is made in conformity with Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC
under the 1933 Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable
to Parent, or pursuant to a "no action" letter obtained by the undersigned
from the SEC staff, is otherwise exempt from registration under the 1933 Act.

  



  

D. Except as set forth in paragraph C above, the undersigned understands that
Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other
disposition of the Parent Common Shares by the undersigned or on the
undersigneds behalf under the 1933 Act or to take any other action necessary
in order to enable the undersigned to make such sale, transfer or other
disposition in compliance with an exemption from such registration.

  



  

E. The undersigned also understands that there will be placed on the
certificates for the Parent Common Shares issued to the undersigned, or on
any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

  



  

 **"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A
TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
APPLIES. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE SOLD,
TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF A
LETTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND
MERCANTILE BANKSHARES CORPORATION, A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT
THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF MERCANTILE BANKSHARES CORPORATION."**

  



  

F. The undersigned also understands that, unless the transfer by the
undersigned of the undersigneds Parent Common Shares has been registered
under the 1933 Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of
Rule 145, Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the
certificates issued to the undersigneds transferee:

  



        
   

  



  

 **"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED
SUCH SECURITIES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE
HOLDER WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION
THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD,
TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."**

  



  

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs E and F
above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend if (i) the securities represented thereby have been registered for
sale by the undersigned under the 1933 Act or (ii) Parent has received either
an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or a "no-action" letter obtained by the undersigned
from the SEC staff to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145
under the 1933 Act no longer apply to the undersigned.

  



  

G. Parent agrees that, to the extent necessary to permit the undersigned to
sell the Parent Common Shares pursuant to Rule 145 and, to the extent
applicable, Rule 144 under the 1933 Act, Parent shall (i) use its reasonable
best efforts to (A) file on a timely basis all reports and data required to
be filed with the SEC by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the " **1934 Act** ") and (B) furnish to
the undersigned upon request a written statement as to whether Parent has
complied with such reporting requirements during the twelve months preceding
any proposed sale of the Parent Common Shares by the undersigned under Rule
145 and (ii) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to permit such
sales pursuant to Rule 145 and Rule 144\. Parent has filed all
reports required to be filed with the SEC under Section 13 of the 1934 Act
during the preceding twelve months.

  



  

H. The undersigned further understands and agrees that the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the undersigned set forth

  



        
   

  



  

herein are for the benefit of Parent and the Company and will be relied upon
by such firms and their respective counsel and accountants.

  



  

I. The undersigned understands and agrees that this letter agreement shall
apply to all shares of the capital stock of Parent and the Company that are
deemed beneficially owned by the undersigned pursuant to applicable federal
securities laws.

  



  

Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part of
the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the Company as
described in the first paragraph of this letter, nor as a waiver of any
rights that the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the
undersigned is such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

In connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 10.02(d)
and 10.03(b) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " **Merger Agreement**
"),(1) dated as of March 27, 2006, between James Monroe Bancorp, Inc., a
Virginia corporation (the " **Company** "), and Mercantile
Bankshares Corporation, a Maryland corporation (" **Parent** "), the
undersigned officer of Parent hereby certifies and represents as to Parent
that:

  



  

1. The consideration to be received by holders of common stock of the Company (" **Company Shares** ") in the merger (the " **Merger** ") of the Company with and into Parent was determined by arms length negotiations between the managements of Parent and the Company. In connection with the Merger, the holders of Company Shares will not receive in exchange for such stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than common stock of Parent (" **Parent Stock** "), cash in an amount equal to no more than 50% of the fair market value of all Company Shares outstanding and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock.

  



  

2. The fair market value of the Parent Stock and/or cash (including cash in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock) received by each Company shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the Company Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.

   (1) All defined terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meaning
ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

        
   

  



  

3. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock to holders of Company Shares is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for consideration.

  



  

4. Neither Parent, any subsidiary of Parent, nor, to the best knowledge of the management of Parent, any partnership (or other entity taxable as a partnership for federal tax purposes) in which Parent or any subsidiary of Parent is a partner, has any plan or intention to redeem, purchase, exchange or otherwise reacquire (including by derivative transactions such as an equity swap which would have the economic effect of an acquisition) any of the Parent Stock to be issued in the Merger, other than stock repurchases made in the open market pursuant to a stock repurchase plan (adopted by Parent) for stock of Parent which is widely held and is publicly and actively traded.

  



  

5. No liabilities of the Company shareholders will be assumed by Parent, and Parent will not acquire in the Merger any Company Shares subject to any liabilities. The liabilities of the Company assumed by Parent and the liabilities to which the transferred assets of the Company are subject were incurred by the Company in the ordinary course of its business (including liabilities of the Company for expenses solely and directly related to the Merger).

  



  

6. After the Merger, no dividends or distributions will be made to the former Company stockholders by Parent other than dividends or distributions made to all holders of Parent Stock.

  



  

7. To the best knowledge of the management of Parent, neither Parent, any subsidiary of Parent, nor any partnership (or other entity taxable as a partnership for federal tax purposes) in which Parent or any subsidiary of Parent is a partner, owns or within the past 5 years has owned, beneficially or of record, any class of stock of the Company or any securities of the Company or any instrument giving the holder the right to acquire any such stock or securities.

  



  

8. Neither Parent nor any subsidiary of Parent (i) has transferred or will transfer cash or other property to the Company or any subsidiary of the Company in anticipation of the Merger or (ii) has made or will make any loan to the Company or any subsidiary the Company of in anticipation of the Merger.

  



  

9. Following the Merger, Parent will continue the conduct of the Companys historic business or use a significant portion of the Companys historic business assets in a business. For this purpose, Parent will be treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of its Qualified Group. A Qualified Group is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with Parent but only if Parent is in control of at least one other corporation and each of the corporations (other than Parent) is controlled directly by one of the other corporations.

  



        
   

  



  

10. The Parent has no plan or intention following the Merger to (i) liquidate, (ii) merge into another entity in a transaction in which the Surviving Corporation will not be the surviving entity, or (iii) sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any of its assets except for dispositions in the ordinary course of its business, transfers or successive transfers of stock or assets to one or more of its Subsidiaries, or transactions pursuant to the Bank Merger Agreement.

  



  

11. Neither Parent nor any other subsidiary of Parent has paid or will pay, directly or indirectly, any expenses (including transfer taxes) incurred by any holder of Company Shares in connection with or as part of the Merger or any related transactions. Neither Parent nor any other subsidiary of Parent has agreed to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any other expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of Company Shares.

  



  

12. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between (i) Parent or any of its subsidiaries and (ii) the Company or any of its subsidiaries that was issued or acquired or will be settled at a discount.

  



  

13. Parent is not a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust or a corporation more than 25 percent (25%) of the fair market value of whose total assets consists of stock and securities of any one issuer and more than 50 percent (50%) of the fair market value of whose total assets consists of stock and securities of five or fewer issuers (each, an " **Investment Company** "). For purposes of this representation, in making the 25% and 50% determinations under the preceding sentence, (i) stock and securities in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiarys assets, (ii) a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the parent owns 50% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or 50% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding, (iii) all entities that are members of the same "controlled group" within the meaning of section 1563(a) of the Internal Revenue Code are treated as a single issuer, and (iv) in determining total assets, there shall be excluded cash and cash items (including receivables), government securities and assets acquired (through incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for purposes of ceasing to be an Investment Company.

  



  

14. None of the compensation received or to be received by any shareholder-employees of the Company is or will be separate consideration for or allocable to, any of their Company Shares to be surrendered in the Merger. None of the shares of Parent Stock to be received by any shareholder-employee of the Company in the Merger is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement. Any compensation paid or to be paid to any shareholder of the Company who will be an employee of or perform other services for Parent or any affiliate thereof after the Merger will be determined by bargaining at arms length.

  



        
   

  



  

15. The Merger will be carried out in accordance with the Merger Agreement and as described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and none of the material terms and conditions therein has been or will be waived or modified.

  



  

16. There are no agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

17. Neither Parent nor Company will take any position on any Federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes or with any of the foregoing representations.

  



  

We understand that you will rely on this letter in rendering your opinions as
to certain United States federal income tax consequences of the Merger. As of
the date hereof, we believe that all of the facts, representations and
assumptions stated or referred to herein are consistent with the state of
facts that will be existing as of the Effective Time. We will immediately
inform you if, after signing this letter, we have reason to believe that any
of the facts described herein, in the Merger Agreement or in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any of the representations made in this letter are or
have become untrue, incorrect or incomplete in any respect.
