agree that the Pubco Shares are being issued pursuant to transactional
exemptions from the prospectus delivery and registration requirements of the

45-106. As required by applicable securities law, the Selling Shareholders
agree to abide by all applicable resale restrictions and hold periods imposed
by all applicable U.S , Canadian and applicable foreign jurisdictions
securities legislation. All certificates representing the Pubco Shares issued

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN OFFERED IN AN
OFFSHORE TRANSACTION TO A PERSON WHO IS NOT A U.S. PERSON (AS DEFINED HEREIN)
PURSUANT TO REGULATION S UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE "1933 ACT").

  

  

NONE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE 1933 ACT, OR ANY U.S. STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND, UNLESS SO
REGISTERED, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE UNITED

PROVISIONS OF REGULATION S UNDER THE 1933 ACT, PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE 1933 ACT, OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE
EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1933 ACT AND IN EACH CASE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. IN ADDITION, HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING
THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE CONDUCTED UNLESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE 1933 ACT.
"UNITED STATES" AND "U.S. PERSON" ARE AS DEFINED BY REGULATION S UNDER THE
1933 ACT."

OFFERED, SOLD, TRANSFERRED, ENCUMBERED, OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT UPON
SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS. INFORMATION CONCERNING THESE RESTRICTIONS
MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CORPORATION OR ITS LEGAL COUNSEL. ANY OFFER OR
DISPOSITION OF THESE SECURITIES WITHOUT SATISFACTION OF SAID CONDITIONS WILL
BE WRONGFUL AND WILL NOT ENTITLE THE TRANSFEREE TO REGISTER OWNERSHIP OF THE
SECURITIES WITH THE CORPORATION"

  

  

2.3 Additional Consideration. As additional consideration for the sale of the
Priveco Shares by the Selling Shareholders to Pubco, Pubco shall deliver to

with appropriate instructions to allow the transfer agent to issue

---|---|--- 
 

  

  

2.5 Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
no certificate for fractional shares of the Pubco Shares will be issued in the
Transaction. In lieu of any such fractional shares, if any of the Selling
Shareholders would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
the Pubco Shares upon surrender of certificates representing the Priveco
Shares for exchange pursuant to this Agreement, the Selling Shareholders will
be entitled to have such fraction rounded up to the nearest whole number of
Pubco Shares and will receive from Pubco a stock certificate representing

and as a result may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed, except
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and in each case only in
accordance with all applicable securities laws.

  

  

2.8 Exemptions. The Selling Shareholders acknowledge that Pubco has advised
such Selling Shareholders that Pubco is relying upon the representations and
warranties of the Selling Shareholders set out in the Questionnaires to issue
the Pubco Shares under an exemption from the prospectus and registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act") and,
in the case of Canadian residents, National Instrument 45-106, and as a
consequence, certain protections, rights and remedies provided by the 1933
Act, including statutory rights of rescission or damages, will not be
available to the Selling Shareholders.

  

  

2.9 Canadian Resale Restrictions. The Selling Shareholders acknowledge that
Pubco is not a reporting issuer in any province or territory of Canada and
accordingly, any applicable hold periods under the British Columbia Securities
Act or any other Canadian jurisdiction may never expire, and the Pubco Shares
may be subject to resale restrictions in Canada for an indefinite period of
time. Additionally, the Selling Shareholders acknowledge that resale of any of
the Pubco Shares by the Selling Shareholders resident in Canada is restricted
