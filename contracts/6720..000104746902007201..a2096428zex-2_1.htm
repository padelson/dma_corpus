Section 1.3. _Closing of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the "
**Closing** ") will take place at a time and on a date (the " **Closing
Date** ") to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the
second business day after satisfaction of the latest to occur of the
conditions set forth in Article 5, at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher
LLP, 333 S. Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90071, unless
another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

  

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition shall vest
in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Acquisition shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company.

  

Section 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended as necessary to
read the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition in effect at
the Effective Time until amended in accordance with applicable law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as following: "The name of the corporation
is Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc." The bylaws of the Surviving Company
shall be amended as necessary to read the same as the bylaws of Acquisition
in effect at the Effective Time until amended in accordance with applicable
law.

  

Section 1.6. _Directors_. The directors of Acquisition at the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Company, each to hold office
in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Company until such directors successor is duly elected
or appointed and qualified. The class of directors of Parent expiring in
2005 shall be expanded by one board member and the vacancy created thereby
shall be filled by action of the Parent Board with a nominee named by the
Company Board prior to the Merger, and such nominee shall be named in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

  

Section 1.7. _Officers_. The initial officers of the Surviving Company at the
Effective Time shall be as listed on _Exhibit C_, each to hold office in

## Section 1.8. _Conversion of Shares_.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per
share, of the Company together with the associated Company Rights under the
Company Rights Agreement (each, a " **Share** " and, collectively, the "
**Shares** ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) Shares held in the Companys treasury or by any of the
Companys Subsidiaries (together with the associated Company Right under the
Company Rights Agreement) and (ii) Shares held by Parent, Acquisition or any
other subsidiary of Parent) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be
converted into and shall become a number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent (" **Parent
Common Stock** ") equal

  

2      
   



  

to the Exchange Ratio (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 1.10(f)) (collectively, "
**Merger Consideration** "). Unless the context otherwise requires,
each reference in this Agreement to shares of Parent Common Stock shall
include the associated Parent Rights.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if,
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock or the Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares then, the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly
adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

  

(b) The " **Exchange Ratio** " shall be 0.95; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the average daily closing price per share of Parent Common Stock
as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (" **NYSE** ") Composite
Transactions reporting system for the fifteen (15) consecutive trading days
ending on and including the second trading day preceding the Closing Date
(the " **Base Trading Price** "), (i) is less than $9.47, the Exchange Ratio
shall be calculated by dividing $9.00 by the Base Trading Price, rounded to
the third (3rd) decimal point; or (ii) is greater than $10.53, the Exchange
Ratio shall be calculated by dividing $10.00 by the Base Trading Price,
rounded to the third (3rd) decimal point.

  

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of the common stock, $0.01
par value per share, of Acquisition shall be converted into one share of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Company.

  

(d) At the Effective Time, each Share held in the treasury of the Company and
each Share held by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition or the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Acquisition, the Company or the
holder thereof, be canceled, retired and cease to exist, and no shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be delivered with respect thereto.

  

Section 1.9. _Dissenters and Appraisal Rights_. The holders of the Shares will
not be entitled to dissenters and appraisal rights in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL.

  

## Section 1.10. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, as required by subsections (b) and (c)
below, Parent shall deliver to its transfer agent, or a depository or trust
institution of recognized standing selected by Parent and Acquisition and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for
the benefit of the holders of Shares for exchange in accordance with
this Article 1: (i) certificates representing the appropriate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8, and (ii) cash
to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares
of Parent Common Stock and such cash are hereinafter referred to as the "
**Exchange Fund** "), in exchange for outstanding Shares.

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " **Certificates**
") and whose shares were converted into the

  

3      
   



  

right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.8: (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock.  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and, if applicable, a check representing the cash consideration to which such
holder may be entitled on account of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 1, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing
the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.10, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 1.10.

  

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 1.10(f), until the holder of record of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor without interest (i) the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.10(f) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

(d) In the event that any Certificate for Shares shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof such shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, as may be
required pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent
or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion, require the delivery of a
suitable bond or indemnity.

  

(e) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to

  

4      
   



  

Section 1.10(c) or 1.10(f)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this Article 1.

  

(f) No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall upon surrender of his or her
Certificate or Certificates be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without
interest) determined by multiplying the closing price of a share of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported in the New York City edition of the
Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another nationally
recognized source) on the date of the Effective Time by the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. The parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares was not separately bargained for consideration, but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the
corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional shares.

  

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
stockholders of the Company upon the one year anniversary the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any stockholders of the Company
who have not theretofore complied with this Article 1 shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock and cash in
lieu of fractional shares, as the case may be, and any applicable dividends
or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.

  

(h) Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares
for shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and as required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

  

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent or Exchange Agent
may withhold Merger Consideration as they reasonably deem necessary to
satisfy their withholding obligations under applicable law, and the
withholding of any such Merger Consideration for such purpose shall be
treated as the payment thereof to the person from whom such amount was
withheld for purposes of determining whether such person received amounts to
which such person is entitled hereunder.

  

## Section 1.11. _Stock Options_.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (each "
**Company Stock Option** " and, collectively, " **Company Stock Options** ")
issued pursuant to the Companys 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan, Non-Employee
Directors Stock Plans, or other agreement or arrangement, whether vested or
unvested, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into options to
purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section 1.11.
All plans or agreements described above pursuant to which any Company Stock
Option has been issued or may be issued are referred to collectively as the "
**Company Plans**." At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall be
deemed to constitute an option to

  

5      
   



  

acquire, on the same terms and conditions (but taking into account any
changes thereto, including any acceleration in the vesting or exercisability
of such option by reason of this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions
or matters contemplated by this Agreement provided for in such option or the
applicable plan with respect thereto) as were applicable to such Company
Stock Option, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder of such Company Stock Option
would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder
exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a price per share equal to (i)
the aggregate exercise price for the Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to
such Company Stock Option divided by (ii) the product of (A) the number of
Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option multiplied
by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in the case of any option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code ("
**incentive stock options** " or " **ISOs** ") Parent may cause the option
price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms
and conditions of exercise of such option to  be determined so as to comply
with Section 424(a) of the Code.

  

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to the Company Plan and that the agreements
evidencing the grants of such options shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section
1.11 after giving effect to the Merger).

  

(c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of Company Stock Options assumed in accordance with this Section
1.11.  Within ten (10) business days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall file a registration statement on Form S8 (or any successor or
other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to any Company Stock Options and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options
remain outstanding.

  

(d) At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be effected
any necessary amendments to the Company Plans to give effect to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 1.11.

  

Section 1.12. _Plan of Reorganization_. The parties hereto hereby adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Department of Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code.

  

# **ARTICLE 2**

  

# ** **

  

# **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  

The Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Acquisition,
subject to the exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Letter previously
delivered by the Company to

  

6      
   



  

Parent (the " **Disclosure Letter** ") and certified by a duly authorized
officer of the Company (which exceptions shall specifically identify the
Section, subsection or paragraph, as applicable, to which such
exception relates), that:

  

## Section 2.1. _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries; Investments_.

  

(a) Section 2.1(a) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of
this Agreement, a true and complete list of each person in which the Company
owns, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting
interests or of which the Company otherwise has the right to direct the
management (each, a " **Subsidiary** ") together with the jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary and the percentage of
each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock or other equity interests owned
directly or indirectly by the Company. All the outstanding capital stock or
other ownership interests of each Subsidiary is owned by the Company,
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien or any other limitation or
restriction. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.
The Company has delivered to Parents counsel accurate and complete copies of
the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws or comparable governing
documents, each as in full force and effect on the date hereof, of the
Company and each Subsidiary. The Company has no operating Subsidiaries other
than those incorporated in a state of the United States, Canada or Costa
Rica.

  

(b) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing does not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. For purposes hereof, the term " **Material
Adverse Effect on the Company** " means any circumstance involving, change in
or effect on the Company or any Subsidiary (i) that is, or is reasonably
likely in the future to be, materially adverse to the business operations,
earnings, or results of operations, assets or liabilities (including
contingent liabilities) or the financial condition of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, excluding from the foregoing any event,
change or circumstance arising out of (A) the compliance by the Company,
Subsidiaries, Parent or Acquisition with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (B) the announcement or disclosure of this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof, (C) any stockholder class action litigation arising
directly out of allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty relating to this
Agreement or (D) to changes in applicable law or regulations or in generally
accepted accounting principles, or (ii) that is reasonably likely to prevent
or materially delay or impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as specifically
set forth in this Agreement, all references to Material Adverse Effect on
the Company or its Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to refer solely to the Company and its Subsidiaries without including
its ownership by Parent after the Merger.

  

(c) _Other Interests_. Section 2.1(c) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true and complete list, as of the date hereof, of each equity investment made
by the Company or any Subsidiary in any person (including the percentage
ownership, purchase price and any management rights granted to the Company or
any such Subsidiary) other than the Subsidiaries

  

7      
   



  

(" **Other Interests** "). The Other Interests are owned directly
or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all Liens.

  

## Section 2.2. _Capitalization of the Company and Subsidiaries_.

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) fifty million
(50,000,000) Shares, of which, as of December 13, 2002, eight million,
eighty-eight thousand, six hundred fifty-six (8,088,656) were issued and
outstanding (each, together with a Company Common Stock purchase right, the "
**Company**   **Right** ") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated
November 27, 2002, between Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC (the "
**Company Rights Agreement** ")); and (ii) ten million (10,000,000) shares
of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share (the " **Company Preferred
Stock** "), none of which are outstanding as of the date hereof. All of the
outstanding Shares are, and the Shares issuable upon exercise of the Company
Stock Options, when issued in accordance with the Company Plans, would be,
validly issued and fully paid, nonassessable and not subject to any
preemptive rights. As of December 13, 2002, an aggregate of one million, six
hundred forty-four thousand, seven hundred fifty-six (1,644,756) Shares were
reserved for issuance and one million, four hundred thirteen thousand, five
hundred thirty-four (1,413,534) Shares were issuable upon or otherwise
deliverable in connection with the exercise of outstanding Company Stock
Options issued pursuant to the Company Plans. Between December 13, 2002 and
the date hereof, no shares of the Companys capital stock have been issued
other than pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock Options already in
existence on such date. Except as set forth above, as of the date hereof,
there are outstanding (i) no shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company, (ii) no securities of the Company or any
Subsidiary convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of
capital stock or voting securities of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii) no
options, warrants or other rights to acquire from the Company or any
Subsidiary and no obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to issue
any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or voting securities of the
Company or any Subsidiary and (iv) no equity equivalent interests in the
ownership or earnings of the Company or any Subsidiary or other similar
rights. All of the outstanding Shares and Company Stock Options
(collectively, the " **Company Securities** ") were issued in compliance with
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " **Securities Act** "), and
applicable state securities laws.  As of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding rights or obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its outstanding capital stock
or other ownership interests. There are no stockholder agreements,
voting trusts or other arrangements or understandings to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party or by which it or the Company Board is bound, and
to the Companys knowledge there are no other agreements, voting trusts or
other arrangements or understandings, relating to the voting or registration
of any shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company or
any Subsidiary. No Shares are issued and held by the Company in its treasury
as of the date hereof. Section 2.2 of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true
and complete list of all holders of outstanding Company Stock Options, the
exercise or vesting schedule, the exercise price per share, and the term of
each such Company Stock Option, as applicable and in the case of Company
Stock Options, whether such option is a nonqualified stock option
or incentive stock option. None of the terms of the Company Stock Options
provides for accelerated vesting or exercisability as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.  The Company has not granted Company Stock
Options to

  

8      
   



  

employees or consultants under any Company Plan at an exercise price of less
than the fair market value per Share at the time of grant as determined in
good faith by the Company Board.

  

(b) The Shares and the Company Rights constitute the only classes of equity
securities of the Company or any Subsidiary registered or required to be
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
**Exchange Act** ").

  

## Section 2.3. _Authority Relative to this Agreement; Recommendation_.

  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject in the case
of the consummation of the Merger, to the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the outstanding Shares of the Companys Common Stock in favor
of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger in
accordance with the DGCL (the " **Company Stockholder Approval** "). The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Company (the " **Company Board** "), and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby except
the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding Shares. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by Parent and Acquisition, a valid, legal and
binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
(including all applicable laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to creditors rights generally or to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law).

  

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger) are fair to and in the best interests of Companys stockholders, (ii)
approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) and (iii) resolved (subject to Section 4.4(d)) to
recommend that Companys stockholders vote for the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger).

  

## Section 2.4. _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

  

(a) The Company has filed all required forms, reports and documents (the "
**Company SEC Reports** ") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
**SEC** ") for the period on or after January 1, 1999, and each of such
Company SEC Reports complied at the time of filing in all material respects
with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
each as in effect on the dates such forms, reports and documents were filed.
None of such Company SEC Reports, including any financial statements or
schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, contained when filed
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under
which they

  

9      
   



  

were made not misleading, except to the extent superseded by a Company SEC
Report filed subsequently and prior to the date hereof.  Each of the
consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes
and schedules thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (the "
**Financial Statements** ") have been prepared in all material respects in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied and maintained throughout the periods indicated, except
where noted therein, and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition of the Company and the Subsidiaries at their
respective dates and the results of their operations and changes in financial
position for the periods covered thereby, in each case in conformity with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (subject, in each
case, to normal year-end adjustments and except that unaudited financial
statements do not contain all required footnotes).

  

(b) The Company has delivered to Acquisition or Parent a complete and correct
copy of any amendments or modifications that have not yet been filed with the
SEC but that the Company presently intends to file, to agreements, documents
or other instruments that previously had been filed by the Company with the
SEC.

  

Section 2.5. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in (i) the registration statement on Form S4 to be filed with the SEC by
Parent in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger (the " **S 4**") will, at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will, at the date mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of
the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein in light of the circumstances under which they are made not
misleading.  The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation, warranty or covenant with respect to any information supplied
or required to be supplied by Parent or Acquisition which is contained in or
omitted from any of the foregoing documents or which is incorporated by
reference therein.

  

Section 2.6. _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except for
filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required
under applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
state securities or "blue sky" laws, the Nasdaq National Market and
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "
**HSR Act** "), any filings under similar merger notification laws or
regulations of foreign Governmental Entities and the filing and recordation
of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, no filing with or
notice to and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of any United
States or foreign court or tribunal, or administrative, governmental or
regulatory body, agency or authority (each, a " **Governmental Entity** ") is
necessary for the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby.
 Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any
provision of the respective Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws (or

  

10      
   



  

similar governing documents) of the Company or any Subsidiary; (ii) result in
a violation or breach of or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse
of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien) under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Material Contract to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or their respective properties
or assets are bound; (iii) result in a violation or breach of or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise
to any right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien)
under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract (other than
any Material Contract) to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or
by which any of them or their respective properties or assets are bound; or

for failures to hold such permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders
and approvals that would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and that have not resulted in

## Section 2.11. _Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters_.

  

(a) Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure Letter lists as of the date hereof all
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" **ERISA** ")), and all bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental
retirement, health, life, or disability insurance, dependent care, severance
and other similar fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements
and any current employment or executive compensation or severance agreements
written or otherwise maintained or contributed to for the benefit of or
relating to any employee or former employee of the Company or any trade
or business (whether or not incorporated) that is a member of a controlled
group including the Company or that is under common control with the Company
within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code (an " **ERISA Affiliate** "),
to the extent

  

12      
   



  

that the Company or any ERISA Affiliate currently has or may incur liability
for payments or benefits thereunder, as well as each plan with respect to
which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate could incur liability under Section
4069 (if such plan has been or were terminated) or Section 4212(c) of ERISA
(together, the " **Employee Plans** "). The Company has made available to
Parent a copy of (i) the two (2) most recent annual reports on Form 5500
filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the " **IRS** ") for each disclosed
Employee Plan where such report is required and (ii) the documents and
instruments governing each such Employee Plan (including where applicable,
without limitation, the plan document, summary plan description or other
summary, most recent actuarial report, and trust or other
funding arrangement). No Employee Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred any material liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to any
such Employee Plan (other than with respect to contributions
required thereunder); each Employee Plan has been maintained in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and with ERISA and the Code; and there
has been no material violation of any reporting or disclosure requirement
imposed by ERISA or the Code. Each Employee Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, and each trust intended to be exempt under
Section 501(a) of the Code, has been determined to be so qualified or exempt
by the IRS. For each Employee Plan which has received such a determination,
there has been no event, condition or circumstance that has adversely
affected or is likely to adversely affect such qualified status. No
"party in interest" (as defined on Section 3(14) of ERISA) of any Employee
Plan has participated in, engaged in or been a party to any transaction that
is prohibited under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA and not
exempt under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA (or
any administrative class or individual exemption issued
thereunder), respectively. With respect to any Employee Plan, (i) neither
the Company, nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has had asserted against it any
claim for taxes under Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the Code and Section 5000
of the Code, or for penalties under ERISA Section 502(c), (i) or (l), nor, to
the knowledge of the Company, is there a basis for any such claim, and (ii)
no officer, director or employee of the Company has committed a breach of any
fiduciary responsibility or obligation imposed by Title I of ERISA. Other
than routine claims for benefits, there is no claim or proceeding (including
any audit or investigation) pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, involving any Employee Plan by any person, or by the IRS, the
United States Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity against
such Employee Plan or the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

  

(b) Section 2.11(b) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a list as of the date
hereof of all (i) employment agreements with officers of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate and (ii) agreements with consultants who are
individuals obligating the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to make annual cash
payments in an amount of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) or more
and (iii) severance agreements, programs and policies of the Company with
or relating to its employees, except such programs and policies required to
be maintained by law. The Company has made available to Parent copies of all
such agreements, plans, programs and other arrangements.

  

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.13, there will be no payment,
accrual of additional benefits, acceleration of payments or vesting of any
benefit under any Employee Plan or any other agreement or arrangement to
which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate is a party, and no employee, officer
or director of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate

  

13      
   



  

will become entitled to severance, termination allowance or similar payments,
solely by reason of entering into or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(d) No Employee Plan that is a welfare benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA provides benefits to former employees of the Company or
its ERISA Affiliates other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code or
similar state laws. The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have complied in all
material respects with the provisions of Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and
Sections 4980B, 9801, 9802, 9811 and 9812 of the Code.

  

(e) There are no controversies relating to any Employee Plan or other labor
matters pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened between the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate and any of its employees, other than
controversies that would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in any
charge, assessment, levy, fine or other liability being imposed upon or
incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary exceeding One Million Dollars
($1,000,000). Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to
persons employed by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate nor does the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate know of any activities or proceedings of any labor
union to organize any such employees. No strikes, work stoppage, grievance,
claim of unfair labor practice, or labor dispute against the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate has occurred, is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate, threatened, and to the knowledge of the Company and
its ERISA Affiliates there is no basis for any of the foregoing. To the
knowledge of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates, there is no organizational
activity being made or threatened by or on behalf of any labor union with
respect to any employees of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

  

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates sponsors or has ever
sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or incurred an obligation to
contribute or incurred a liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to
any Multiemployer Plan or to a Multiple Employer Plan. For these purposes, "
**Multiemployer Plan** " means a multiemployer plan, as defined in Section
3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, and " **Multiple Employer Plan** " means any
Employee Benefit Plan sponsored by more than one employer, within the meaning
of Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has, or reasonably could be expected
to have, any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any other type
of Employee Plan. The Company has provided to Parent a written estimate of
withdrawal liability, if any, that would occur upon withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan.

  

(g) To the extent permitted by applicable law and the applicable Employee
Plan, each Employee Plan (other than any stock option plan) can be amended or
terminated at any time, without consent from any other party and without
liability other than for benefits accrued as of the date of such amendment or
termination (other than charges incurred as a result of such termination).
The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have made full and timely payment of all
amounts required to be contributed or paid as expenses or accrued such
payments in accordance with normal procedures under the terms of each
Employee Plan and applicable law, and the Company and its ERISA Affiliates
shall continue to do so through the Closing.

  



  



  

14      
   

   

  



  

(h) To the knowledge of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates, no key
employee, or group of employees, of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has
expressed to the Company any plan to terminate employment with the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate. The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have complied in
all material respects with all laws relating to the employment of labor,
including provisions thereof relating to wages, hours, equal opportunity and
collective bargaining.

  

(i) With respect to each master and prototype tax-qualified retirement plan
(" **M andP Plan**") sponsored or maintained by the Company and/or any ERISA
Affiliate, the Company and any such ERISA Affiliate has, on or before the end
of the 2001 plan year or such later date as permitted pursuant to applicable
IRS pronouncements, either adopted or certified in writing its intent to
adopt the required GUST amendments to each such MandP Plan, and to the
knowledge of the Company, an application for a GUST opinion letter for each
such MandP Plan was filed with the IRS by the MandP Plan sponsor on or before
December 31, 2000. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate has adopted or shall
also adopt the GUST-approved MandP Plan by the deadline specified in IRS
Announcement 2001-104 or subsequent IRS guidance. For purposes hereof, "
**GUST** " means the statutes referenced in IRS Announcement 2001-104. With
respect to any individually designed tax-qualified retirement plans sponsored
or maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, the Company and each
such ERISA Affiliate has adopted the required GUST amendments and submitted
the plan to the IRS on or before February 28, 2002 or such later date as
permitted by applicable IRS pronouncements for a favorable determination
letter as to its tax qualified status.

  

(j) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have complied in all material
respects with the laws of any foreign jurisdiction with respect to any
employee benefit plan or arrangements maintained in such jurisdiction in
which the employees of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate participate.

  

(k) The Company has no commitment, intention or understanding to create,
terminate or adopt any Employee Plan that would result in any additional
liability to the Company. Since the beginning of the current fiscal year of
any Employee Plan, no event has occurred and no condition or circumstance has
existed that reasonably would be expected to result in an increase in the
benefits under or the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan from the
level of benefits or expense incurred for the most recently completed fiscal
year of such Employee Plan.

Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects and
accurately reflect in all material respects the information pertaining to the

to the exceptions set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter previously
delivered by Parent to the Company (the " **Parent Disclosure Letter** ") and
certified by a duly authorized officer of Parent (which exceptions shall
specifically identify the Section, subsection or paragraph, as applicable, to
which such exception relates), that:

  

## Section 3.1. _Organization_.

  

(a) Section 3.1(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date
of this Agreement, a true and complete list of each person in which Parent
owns, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting

accurate and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws,
as currently in full force and effect, of Acquisition.

  

(b) Each of Parent, and the Parent Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing does not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. For purposes hereof, the term " **Material Adverse
Effect on Parent** " means any circumstance involving, change in or effect on
Parent or any of its subsidiaries (i) that is, or is reasonably likely in the
future to be, materially adverse to the business operations, earnings,
results of operations, assets or liabilities (including contingent
liabilities) or the financial condition of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken

Parent or Acquisition with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (B)
the announcement or disclosure of this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof, (C) any stockholder class action litigation arising directly out of
allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement or (D)

or impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, all
references to Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Parent Subsidiaries

Parent Subsidiaries without including its ownership of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Merger.

the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in
any breach of any provision of the respective Certificate or Certificate
of Incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Acquisition; (ii) result in

of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien) under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
license, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which

Statement/Prospectus, as the case may be, so that such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, the party which obtains knowledge
of such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the
extent required by law, rules or regulations, Company and Parent shall

value of the assets of the Company or any material Subsidiary, and otherwise
on terms that the Company Board by a majority vote determines in its good
faith judgment (after receiving the advice of the Company Financial Advisor
or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more
favorable to the Companys stockholders than the Merger.

  

(b) The Company agrees that it and its affiliates and their respective
officers, directors and employees shall, and that it shall direct its
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives and
agents to, cease any existing activities, discussions or

  

38      
   



  

negotiations with any other persons with respect to any possible Third Party
Acquisition. Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates shall, nor shall
the Company authorize or permit any of its or their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other
representatives and agents to, directly or indirectly, (i)
encourage, solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate the submission of any
proposal for a Third Party Acquisition; (ii) participate in or initiate any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information
with respect to, the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective
businesses, assets or properties (other than Parent and Acquisition or any
designees of Parent and Acquisition) in connection with, or take any other
action to knowingly facilitate any Third Party Acquisition or any inquiries
or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Third Party Acquisition or (iii) enter into any agreement
with respect to any Third Party Acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 4.4 or any other provision of this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company Board from furnishing information (including non-public
information with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective
businesses, assets or properties) to, or renewing or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party that makes an unsolicited,
bona fide written proposal for a Third Party Acquisition, if and to the
extent that (A) the Company is required to do so by the terms of that certain
Standstill Agreement dated November 21, 1997 between the Company and Bull Run
Corporation, as amended to date (the " **Standstill Agreement** ") or (B) (i)
the Company Board, by a majority vote determines in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with independent legal counsel, that failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to constitute or result in a breach by the Company
Board of its fiduciary duty to the Companys stockholders under applicable
law, (ii) the Company Board, by a majority vote, reasonably determines in
good faith that such proposal for a Third Party Acquisition constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal which, if accepted, is
reasonably capable of being consummated (after the receipt by the Third Party
making such approval of information requested by such Third Party and the
revision of such proposal to reflect such information), taking into account
all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the
Third Party making the proposal and (iii) prior to taking such action, (x)
the Company promptly provides prior written notice to Parent to the effect
that it is proposing to take such action and (y) receives from such person an
executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form.

  

(c) The Company shall promptly (but in no case later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt) notify Parent if the Company, any Subsidiary or any of
their respective officers or other employees, directors, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other representatives or agents receives any
proposal or inquiry concerning a Third Party Acquisition or request for
nonpublic information by any person who is making, or who has indicated that
it is considering making, a proposal for a Third Party Acquisition, including
all material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person
submitting such proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any
written proposal for a Third Party Acquisition or amendments or supplements
thereto, and shall thereafter promptly provide to Parent such information as
is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed of the status of any
inquiries, discussions or negotiations with such person proposing the
Third Party Acquisition, and any material changes to the terms and conditions
of such proposal for a Third Party Acquisition, and shall promptly provide to
Parent a copy of any information delivered to such person which has not
previously been made available to Parent.

  

39      
   



  

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 4.4(d), the Company Board shall not
withdraw or adversely modify its recommendation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, such recommendation, or approve or recommend any
Third Party Acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (x) the Company
receives an unsolicited bona fide written proposal for a Third Party
Acquisition that the Company Board, by a majority vote, reasonably determines
in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal which, if accepted, is likely
to be consummated taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the proposal and the Third Party making the proposal and (y)
the Company Board by a majority vote determines in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with independent legal counsel, that failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to constitute or result in a breach by the Company
Board of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable
law, the Company Board may withdraw or adversely modify its recommendation of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, recommend a
Superior Proposal or enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, but in each case only (i) after providing written notice to Parent
advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and
identifying the person making such Superior Proposal (a " **Notice of
Superior Proposal** ") and (ii) if Parent does not, within three (3) business
days after Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, make an offer
that the Company Board by a majority vote determines in its good faith
judgment (after receiving the advice of the Company Financial Advisor or
another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be at least
as favorable to the Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to enter
into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal unless and until this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1 and the Company has paid the
fees required by Section 6.3.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any disclosure that the
Company Board may be compelled to make with respect to the receipt of a
proposal for a Third Party Acquisition or otherwise in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act will not
constitute a violation of this Agreement,  _provided_  that, other than as
required by applicable law, such disclosure states that no action will be
taken by the Company Board in violation of Section 4.4(d).

  

(f) Except as provided in Section 4.4(d) and Article 6, nothing in this
Section 4.4 shall permit the Company to terminate this Agreement or affect
any other obligations of the Company under this Agreement.

42      
   



  

to encourage its employees to accept any offers of employment extended by

necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers
and directors of each party hereto shall take all such necessary action.

  

Section 4.9. _Public Announcements_. Parent, Acquisition and the Company, as
the case may be, will consult with one another before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to

## Section 4.10. _Indemnification and Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

  

(a) After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to
indemnify and hold harmless (and shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law to), to the extent not
covered by insurance, each person who is now or has been prior to the date
hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of
the Company or any Subsidiary (the " **Indemnified Persons** ") against (i)
all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and
expenses), settlement, payments or liabilities arising out of or in
connection with any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact
that such person is or was an officer or director of the Company or any
Subsidiary, whether or not pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time and whether or not asserted or claimed prior
to or at or after the Effective Time (" **Indemnified Liabilities** "); and
(ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent required or permitted
under applicable law.  Nothing contained herein shall make Parent,
Acquisition, the Company or the Surviving Company, an insurer, a co-insurer
or an excess insurer in respect of any insurance policies which may provide
coverage for Indemnified Liabilities, nor shall this Section 4.10 relieve the
obligations of any insurer in respect thereto. The parties hereto intend, to
the extent not prohibited by applicable law, that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 4.10 shall apply without limitation to negligent
acts or omissions by an Indemnified Person. Each Indemnified Person is
intended to be a third party beneficiary of this Section 4.10 and may
specifically enforce its terms. This Section 4.10 shall not limit or
otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified Person may have under
any agreement with the Company or under the Companys Certificate
of Incorporation or bylaws as presently in effect. Parent shall cause the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Entity to maintain
in effect, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
current provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
of Acquisition regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses.

  

43      
   



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Company to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its
directors and officers as of or prior to the date hereof and any
indemnification provisions under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation
or bylaws as in effect on the date hereof.

  

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will
maintain or cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect, if available,
directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who, as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy (the " **Insured
Parties** ") on terms no less favorable to the Insured Parties than those of
the Companys present directors and officers liability insurance policy;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving
Company be required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such coverage (or such coverage as is
available for 200% of such annual premium); _provided_ , _further_ , that, in
lieu of maintaining such existing insurance as provided above, Parent may
cause coverage to be provided under any policy maintained for the benefit of
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, so long as the terms are not
materially less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries thereof than such
existing insurance.

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 4.10 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each person entitled to indemnification
hereunder and the heirs and representatives of such person.  Parent will not
permit the Surviving Company to merge or consolidate with any other person
unless the Surviving Company will ensure that the surviving or resulting
entity assumes the obligations imposed by this Section 4.10.

  

Section 4.11. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall provide
prompt notice to Parent and Acquisition, and Parent and Acquisition shall
provide prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which has caused or would be
likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to
become untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions set forth in Sections
5.2(a) and 5.3(a), as applicable, would not be satisfied and (ii) any failure
of the Company, Parent or Acquisition, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder such that the conditions set forth
in Sections 5.2(b) and 5.3(b), as applicable, would not be satisfied;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 4.11 shall not cure such breach or non-compliance or limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.

  

## Section 4.12. _Affiliates_.

  

(a) The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as
soon as practicable from all stockholders of the Company who may be
affiliates of the Company or Parent pursuant to Rule 145 under the Securities
Act (" **Company Affiliates** "), after the date of this Agreement and on or
prior to the Effective Time, a letter agreement substantially in the form of 
_Exhibit B_.

  

44      
   



  

(b) Parent shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the S4 for
the purpose of resale by Company Affiliates of shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

Section 4.13. _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. The Company and each ERISA
Affiliate that is a plan sponsor of a 401(k) plan agrees to adopt resolutions
to terminate its 401(k) plan and fully vest plan participants immediately
prior to the Closing, unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion,
provides the Company with written notice at least seven (7) days before the
Closing Date, that any such 401(k) plan shall be continued after the Closing
Date. Unless such notice is received, Parent shall receive from the Company
evidence that the Board of the relevant company has adopted resolutions to
terminate the 401(k) plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent), effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date but contingent on the Closing
occurring.

  

Section 4.14. _Lump Sum Distributions_. In the event that the Company
terminates any plan pursuant to Section 4.13, the Company and each ERISA
Affiliate agrees to amend any Company or ERISA Affiliate sponsored profit
sharing plan that is intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a),
including any 401(k) plan, to provide that plan distributions shall be made
solely in the form of a lump sum and any other forms of distribution shall
cease to be available after the ninety (90) day period described in United
States Income Tax Treasury Regulation section 1.411(e)(1)(ii)(A).  Subject
to the preceding sentence, such amendment shall be adopted pursuant to the
same resolutions in Section 4.13 and shall be contingent on the occurrence of
the Closing.

  

## Section 4.15. _Employee Benefits_.

  

(a) Parent agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, except as
explicitly provided herein, Parent shall assume and honor all employee
benefit plans, agreements and programs of the Company in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, subject to
any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such terms or
as otherwise permitted by applicable law. For a period of not less than one
year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to individuals who are employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time (other than any employees
subject to collective bargaining agreements) and who continue to be employed
by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary after the Effective Time (the "
**Company Employees** "), compensation and employee benefits that are, in
the aggregate, not less favorable than those provided to Company
Employees immediately before the Effective Time (it being understood that
any discretionary equity and equity based awards will remain discretionary),
as disclosed by Company to Parent before the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ that, in lieu of any benefits under Company benefit plans and
programs, Parent may provide Company Employees with compensation and employee
benefits under Parents employee benefit plans and programs that are, in the
aggregate, not less favorable than those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries (it being understood that
discretionary equity and equity based awards will remain discretionary). The
foregoing shall not be construed to prevent the termination of employment of
any Company Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular
employee benefit plan or program to the extent permitted by its terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time or as otherwise permitted by
applicable law.

  

45      
   

   

  



  

(b) The provisions of this Section 4.15 are not intended to create rights of
third party beneficiaries.

  

Section 4.16. _Long Term Incentive Plan_. Parent agrees that upon termination
of the Companys 1994 Long Term Incentive Plan, the employees of the Company
who become employees of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries may
participate in Parents 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan, subject to the terms
and conditions of Parents 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan, and that service
with the Company shall be treated as service with Parent for determining
eligibility of the Companys employees under Parents 1999 Long-Term
Incentive Plan.

  

Section 4.17. _Tax-Free Reorganization_. Each of the Company and Parent agrees
to refrain from taking any action prior to, on or after the Effective Time
that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent
shall provide to Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP (or such other counsel
reasonably acceptable to Parent) and Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP (or such
other counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company) a certificate containing
representations reasonably requested by counsel in connection with the
opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 5.2(d) and 5.3(d). The Company
shall provide Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP (or such other counsel reasonably
acceptable to Parent) and Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP (or such other
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company) a certificate containing
representations reasonably requested by counsel in connection with the
opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 5.2(d) and 5.3(d).

  

Section 4.18. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretative
guidance of the SEC so that the assumption of Company Options held by Company
Insiders pursuant to this Agreement and the receipt by Company Insiders of
Parent Common Stock in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger, shall be
exempt transactions for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. For
purposes of this Section 4.18, a " **Company Insider** " is any officer or
director of the Company who may become a covered person for purposes of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act of Parent, if any.

  

Section 4.19. _Takeover Statutes_. If any anti-takeover or similar statute
or regulation is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the parties and its Board of Directors shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to grant or secure any required consents
or approvals and take all such actions as are reasonable and legally
permissible so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects (including any resulting delays) of any
such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

Section 4.20. _Company Rights Agreement_. The Company shall either (a)
promptly redeem all preferred share purchase rights under the Company Rights
Agreement or (b) amend the Company Rights Agreement to exempt the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby from the Company Rights Agreement, and
take all other action to ensure that the Rights shall not become exercisable
and no Distribution Date (as such terms are defined in the Company Rights
Agreement) shall occur thereunder prior to the Closing Date.

representation or warranty on the part of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, or if any such representation or warranty of the Company shall
have become untrue, in both cases, such that the condition set forth in

continuing at such time; (ii) there shall have been a material breach by the
Company of any of its covenants or obligations to be performed under this
Agreement, and the Company has not cured such breach (if capable of being

50      
   



  

directors, officers or stockholders, other than the provisions of this
Section 6.2 and Sections 4.8(c) and 6.3, and all of Article 7 except
for Section 7.10. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall relieve any
party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination.

  

## Section 6.3. _Fees and Expenses_.

  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:

  

(i) Section 6.1(c)(vi), 6.1(d)(iii), 6.1(d)(iv), 6.1(d)(v) or 6.1(d)(viii);
or

  

(ii) Section 6.1(c)(iii) or 6.1(d)(vi) and, at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting at which the Company failed to obtain the requisite
vote, there shall be outstanding at that time an offer by a Third Party to
consummate a Third Party Acquisition, there shall have been under
consideration by the Company a Third Party Acquisition or a Third Party shall
have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) a plan or proposal with respect
to a Third Party Acquisition and, within twelve months after such
termination, (A) the Company enters into an agreement with respect to a
Company Acquisition or (B) a transaction constituting a Company Acquisition
occurs involving any party (or any affiliate thereof) (x) with whom the
Company (or its agents) had negotiations with a view to a Third Party
Acquisition or (y) who had submitted a proposal or expressed an interest in a
Third Party Acquisition, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y) after the
date hereof and prior to such termination; or

  

(iii) Section 6.1(d)(i) or (ii) as the result of a willful breach by the
Company and, within twelve months thereafter, (A) the Company enters into an
agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition, or (B) a Company Acquisition
occurs involving any party (or any affiliate thereof) (x) with whom the
Company (or its agents) had negotiations with a view to a Third Party
Acquisition or (y) who had submitted a proposal or expressed an interest in a
Third Party Acquisition, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y) after the
date hereof and prior to such termination;

  

Parent and Acquisition would suffer direct and substantial damages, which
damages cannot be determined with reasonable certainty. To compensate Parent
and Acquisition for such damages, the Company shall pay to Parent the amount
of Two Million, Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,900,000) as liquidated
damages immediately upon the occurrence of the event described in this
Section 6.3(a) giving rise to such damages (the " **Termination Fee** ").
Except for any claims or causes of action based on fraud, in the event that
the Termination Fee is paid as required herein, such Termination Fee payment
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to such termination and
all matters arising out of or in connection with or in any way related to
such termination or matters and neither the Purchaser nor Acquisition nor
their shareholders shall be entitled to any further or other rights, claims
or remedies. It is specifically agreed that the amount to be paid pursuant
to this Section 6.3(a) represents liquidated damages and not a penalty. The
Company hereby waives any right to set-off or counterclaim against such
amount.

  

For purposes of this Agreement, " **Company Acquisition** " shall mean any
of the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement); (i) a

  



  



  

51      
   



  

merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which
the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction hold
less than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate equity interests in the
surviving or resulting person of such transaction, (ii) a sale or other
disposition by the Company or any material Subsidiary of assets representing
in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate fair market value of the
business of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a while, immediately
prior to such sale or (iii) the acquisition by any person or group (including
by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the Company),
directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire
beneficial ownership of shares of capital stock representing in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company.

  

(b) Except as provided in this Section 6.3, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, except that fees and expenses incurred in connection with (i) the
filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S4
and the solicitation of stockholder approval of this Agreement and the
Merger, and (ii) any filings required under the HSR Act and similar foreign
merger notification laws shall be shared equally by the Company and Parent.

  

Section 6.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by
the Company, Parent and Acquisition at any time before or after approval of
the Merger by the stockholders of the Company but after any such approval no
amendment shall be made that requires the approval of such stockholders under
applicable law without such approval. This Agreement (including the
Disclosure Letter) may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of the parties hereto.

  

Section 6.5. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document certificate or writing delivered pursuant
hereto or (iii) waive compliance by another party with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument, in writing, signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

  

# **ARTICLE 7**

  

# ** **

  

# **MISCELLANEOUS**

  

Section 7.1. _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. The
representations and warranties made herein shall not survive beyond the
Effective Time or a termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

  

Section 7.2. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the
Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits and

52      
   



  

respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings both written and oral between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and (ii) shall not be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquisition may assign
any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Acquisition
of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such
obligations.

  

Section 7.3. _Validity_. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid
or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected

Section 7.10. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and
