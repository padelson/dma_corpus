               (ii) all liabilities and obligations arising from and after the
            Closing Date relating to the ownership or operation of the Target

            as a result of action or inaction prior to the Closing Date shall be
            retained by the Sellers;

            shall be retained by the Sellers; and

               (v) liabilities and obligations for Taxes as and to the extent
            set forth in Article VIII hereof.

   Section 1.3 WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.

         (a) At least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall provide Purchaser with the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet, together with a
calculation of the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount. On the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser, in cash, an amount equal to the
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount.

         (b) As soon as possible after the Closing Date, but in no event later
than 60 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
the Sellers the Closing Balance Sheet together with a calculation of the Final
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, and the Preliminary Bonus Schedule. The
Sellers shall have 30 days to review the Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount and to deliver a
written notice (the "DISPUTE NOTICE") of any disagreements specifying in
reasonable detail the nature and extent of such disagreement. If no Dispute
Notice is delivered within such period, Purchaser's calculation shall be deemed
accepted by the Sellers. If the Sellers and the Purchaser are unable to resolve
any such disagreement within 10 Business Days of the Purchaser's receipt of the
Dispute Notice, the items of disagreement shall be referred for final
determination to an independent accounting firm of national reputation (the
"INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT") reasonably agreed to by the Purchaser and the Sellers.
The Independent Accountant shall make a determination of the Final Working
Capital Adjustment Amount within 20 Business Days following appointment by the
Purchaser and the Sellers and such determination shall be binding on the
parties.

         (c) The Sellers shall pay the Purchaser an amount, in cash, equal to
the Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount, if positive, or the Purchaser shall
pay the Sellers an amount in cash equal to the Final Working Capital Adjustment
Amount (up to a maximum amount equal to the Closing Working Capital Adjustment
Amount), if negative, following the determination of such amount pursuant to
clause (b) hereof.

         (d) On April 15, 2004, Purchaser will deliver to the Sellers a schedule
of all bonuses paid by Purchaser for services performed during the 2003 calendar
year (which bonuses in the aggregate shall be referred to herein as the "2004
BONUS AMOUNT") to its employees who were employed by the Sellers (or any Target
Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Closing (each, an "ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE"). If
the 2004 Bonus Amount is less than the amount set forth under the "Accrued
Bonuses" line item on the Closing Balance Sheet, on an annualized basis, then
Purchaser shall pay to Sellers on April 15, 2004, an amount equal to the product
of (i) the difference of (A) the amount set forth under the "Accrued Bonuses"
line item on the Closing Balance Sheet, MINUS (B)


                                       3
<Page>

the 2004 Bonus Amount; MULTIPLIED BY (ii) a percentage equal to the
percentage relationship that the number of days from January 1, 2003 to the
Closing Date bears to 365, expressed as a decimal; PROVIDED that such payment
shall not exceed the net amount paid, if any, by Sellers to Purchaser as part
of the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount and the Final Working
Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Sellers dispute the 2004 Bonus Amount, the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in clause (b) of this Section 1.3
shall apply.

   Section 1.4 EARN OUT.

         (a) From and including the end of the last day of Connection Academy's
fourth full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date to December 31, 2007, if on
the last day of any fiscal quarter (each a "MEASUREMENT DATE"), the Charter
School EBITDA during the Measurement Period equals or exceeds the Initial Target
Amount, then Holdings shall be required to pay Ventures or its successors, in
cash, an amount equal to the Initial Earn Out Amount not later than six months
following the Measurement Date (a "PAYMENT DATE"); PROVIDED, THAT, if the Seller
Note remains outstanding on any Payment Date, Holdings may elect, in lieu of
paying such amount in cash, to have such amount added to the outstanding
principal balance of the Seller Note.

         (b) From the date that the Initial Earn Out Amount is earned by Sylvan
to December 31, 2007, if on any Measurement Date, the Charter School EBITDA
during the Measurement Period equals or exceeds the Incremental Target Amount,
then Holdings shall be required to pay Ventures or its successors, in cash, an
amount equal to the Incremental Earn Out Amount not later than the Payment Date;
PROVIDED, THAT, if the Seller Note remains outstanding on any Payment Date,
Holdings may elect, in lieu of paying such amount in cash, to have such amount
added to the outstanding principal balance of the Seller Note.

         (c) In the event that Purchaser transfers or sells Connections Academy
to a third party prior to December 31, 2007, the Purchaser shall either (i)
provide for the buyer to assume in writing the obligations under this Section
1.4, or (ii) pay to Ventures or its successors $10,000,000 in cash, MINUS any
amounts previously paid to Ventures or its successors (or added to the balance
of the Seller Note) pursuant to this Section 1.4; PROVIDED, THAT, if the Seller
Note remains outstanding on any Payment Date, Holdings may elect, in lieu of
paying such amount in cash, to have such amount added to the outstanding
principal balance of the Seller Note.

         (d) Purchaser shall provide a written statement to Sylvan not later
than 90 days following any Measurement Date providing an accounting of all
calculations made in connection with such Measurement Date pursuant to this
Section 1.4 and all financial data relied on by Purchaser in making such
calculations. If requested by Sylvan, Purchaser shall permit Sylvan and its
auditors, through its authorized representatives, to have reasonable access to
and examine and make copies of all books, records or information relating to all
calculations made in connection with this Section 1.4 and such financial and
operating data and other information relied upon in making such calculations
that are not delivered to Sylvan pursuant hereto. In connection with


                                       4
<Page>

such request, Purchaser shall comply with the provisions of Section 5.13(c) of
this Agreement.

   Section 1.5 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE; TAX FILINGS.

      (a) The Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to jointly
prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price and all other capitalizable costs
incurred in connection with the Transactions (collectively, the "ALLOCABLE
AMOUNT") among the Target Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law, as appropriate), which allocation shall be binding upon
the Purchaser and the Sellers. If Purchaser and the Sellers cannot agree on the
allocation within 60 days after the Closing Date, such dispute shall be settled
by Deloitte & Touche LLP or another accounting firm of international reputation,
in either case, mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers (an "INDEPENDENT
ACCOUNTING FIRM"). The Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve such dispute
within 30 days of its submission. The determination of the allocation of the
Purchase Price by the Independent Accounting Firm, as set forth in a written
notice to Purchaser and Sellers, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between Purchaser and Sellers in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by each party (as finally determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of all disputed items
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. The parties agree that the
purchase price allocation for the German Subsidiaries shall equal $29,000,000
(inclusive of any and all intercompany obligations of any one of the German
Subsidiaries). Any subsequent adjustments to the consideration for the Target
Assets shall be reflected in such allocation as jointly revised by Purchaser and
the Sellers in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the U.S.
Treasury regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law, as appropriate).

      (b) Each of Sellers and Purchaser shall (i) be bound by the allocation of
the Allocable Amount for all Tax purposes, (ii) prepare and file all Tax returns
to be filed with any taxing authority in a manner consistent with such
allocation, and (iii) take no position inconsistent with this Section 1.5 in any
Tax return, any proceeding before any taxing authority or otherwise unless and
to the extent required to do so pursuant to a determination (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law). In the event the allocation of the Allocable Amount is disputed by any
taxing authority, the party receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly
notify the other party of such dispute, and the Sellers and Purchaser shall
cooperate in good faith in responding to such challenge in order to preserve the
effectiveness of such allocation.

         (a) After the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date or earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Sellers will
not, and the Sellers will cause their Subsidiaries and Affiliates and the
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, consultants and
other agents and advisors of the Sellers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action to encourage, solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) encourage or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any
nonpublic information relating to the Targeted Businesses or afford access to
the properties, books or records of the Targeted Businesses or of the Sellers
regarding the Target Assets to, any Person (other than to Purchaser, its
representatives and advisors) concerning an Acquisition Proposal. The Sellers
will notify Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event,
within forty-eight hours of any Acquisition Proposal received by the Sellers or
any of their Subsidiaries or any of their representatives, Affiliates,
employees, advisors, agents, officers or directors, any indication that any
Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for

Acquisition Proposal and shall request (or if any of them has contractual rights
to do so, demand) the return of all documents, analyses, financial statements,
projections and other data and information previously furnished to others in
connection with any potential Acquisition Proposal.

         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers may engage in
discussions or negotiations with, and furnish nonpublic information or access
to, any Person in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal by such Person
received without violation of this Agreement if (i) the Sellers have complied
with the terms of Section 5.2(a), (ii) the Board of Directors of Sylvan or the
Special Committee of Sylvan, as appropriate, determines in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal would result in a Superior Proposal and, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be deemed
to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (iii) such
Person executes a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the
Sellers than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (iv) the
Sellers shall have delivered to Purchaser three Business Days' prior written
notice (the "FIRST NOTICE") advising Purchaser that it intends to take such
action. Upon receipt of the First Notice, Purchaser will notify the Sellers as

pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(y), it shall not be required to make the election
provided in subparts (a) and (b) of that section at the time it provides the
Termination Fee Notice, but shall be required to make such election no later

Section 7.1(c)(iii)(C). The Sellers shall deliver no more than one First Notice
with respect to a Person that has provided an Acquisition Proposal unless such
Person provides a new Acquisition Proposal following a matching offer by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii)(D).

         (c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or any other provision of
this Agreement shall prohibit the Sellers or any director, officer, agent or

a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant
to Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making such
disclosure to Sylvan's shareholders as, in the good faith judgment of Sylvan's
Board of Directors after consultation with outside counsel, is required under
applicable law.

agreeable times, reasonable access to all offices and other facilities of the
Targeted Businesses and to all books and records relating to the Targeted
Businesses, (ii) permit Purchaser, at reasonably agreeable times, to make such
inspections and to make copies of such books and records as it may reasonably
require and (iii) furnish Purchaser with such financial and operating data and
other information concerning the Targeted Businesses as Purchaser may from time

conduct all such inspections in a manner that will limit disruptions to the
business and operations of the Targeted Businesses.

         (b) Purchaser and its authorized representatives (including its
designated engineers or consultants) may at reasonably agreeable times enter
into and upon all or any portion of the Targeted Businesses' or any Target
Subsidiary's properties (including all the Leased Real Property) in order to
investigate and assess, as Purchaser deems necessary or appropriate in its sole
and absolute discretion, the environmental condition of such properties or the
business conducted thereat. Such investigation may include, but need not be
limited to, the performance of soil and surface or ground water sampling,
monitoring, borings or testing and any other tests, investigations, audits,

conditions or Materials of Environmental Concern. The Sellers shall, and shall
cause the Targeted Businesses and the Target Subsidiaries to, cooperate with
Purchaser and its authorized representatives in conducting such investigation,

agreed upon times to their properties and businesses, together with full
permission to conduct such investigation, and shall provide to Purchaser and its

or reports, any environmental investigation results, reports or assessments

relevant information relating to environmental matters in respect of the
Targeted Businesses.

   Section 5.4 EFFORTS AND ACTIONS TO CAUSE CLOSING TO OCCUR.

         (a) Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, Purchaser and the Sellers shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done and cooperate with each other in order to do, all things
necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any applicable laws) to consummate
the Closing and the Transactions as promptly as practicable including, but not
limited to, (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and
notices required to be filed to consummate the Closing and the other
Transactions and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any
requisite approvals, authorizations, consents, orders, licenses, permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waivers by any third party or Governmental Entity,
and (ii) the preparation of any disclosure documents and other materials
reasonably requested by Purchaser in order to facilitate the Financing of any of
the Transactions. In addition, Purchaser and the Sellers shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any (i) permission, approval or
consent from any Governmental Entity or other Person required to be obtained
prior to Closing or (ii) financing of the Transactions.

         (b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the
other parties hereto with respect to, provide any necessary information with
respect to, and provide the other parties (or their respective counsel) with
copies of, all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any
other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party hereto shall promptly
provide the other parties with copies of any communication received by such
party from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions. If any
party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information
or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity with respect to any of
the Transactions, then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause
to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other parties, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. To the
extent that transfers, amendments or modifications of permits (including
environmental permits) are required as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or consummation of any of the Transactions, the Sellers shall use
their reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers, amendments or
modifications.

         (c) The Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain,
prior to the Closing, (i) the unconditional consent to the Closing and the other
Transactions of each lender whose consent, waiver or amendment is required under
any agreement to permit the consummation of the Transactions and to whom the
Sellers or any Target Subsidiary owes in excess of $250,000 as of the Closing
Date, (ii) the unconditional consent to the Closing and the other Transactions
of each lessor under each


                                       40
<Page>

Lease whose consent, waiver or amendment is required to permit the consummation
of the Transactions and the assignment or sublease of each such Lease, in every
case without loss of any premises, loss of any option to renew or expand,
increase in rent, or other material change to the terms and conditions of such
Lease that were effective prior to the request for said consent; (iii)
non-disturbance and attornment agreements in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser from each of the master landlords under the subleases described in
Exhibits D, E and F, and from each of the master landlords' mortgagees, if any,
providing, among other things, that if Sylvan's lease with any such landlord
terminates for a reason other than a Purchaser default under its sublease (or if
any mortgagee forecloses on the master landlord's estate and Sylvan's lease
and/or Purchaser's sublease is subordinate to such mortgage), then such master
landlord (or mortgagee, as the case may be) agrees not to disturb Purchaser in
its peaceable possession of the sublet premises for the remaining term of the
sublease, so long as Purchaser attorns to such party and agrees to recognize
such party as its landlord in connection therewith, including paying all
sublease rent thereto; (iv) the unconditional consent to the Closing and the
other Transactions of the issuer of each material insurance policy whose right
to consent, waiver or amendment is required, to avoid loss of insurance, to
permit the consummation of the Transactions pursuant to its terms and (v) the
unconditional consent to the Closing and the other Transactions of each other
party to each material contract whose consent, waiver or amendment is required
thereunder to permit the consummation of the Transactions, except for such
consents identified on Part 5.4(c) of the Disclosure Schedule the failure of
which to obtain would not materially adversely affect the Targeted Businesses or
any Target Subsidiary or the ability of the Sellers or Purchaser to consummate
the Transactions. All such releases and consents obtained prior to Closing shall
be in writing and executed counterparts thereof shall be delivered to Purchaser
at or prior to the Closing.

         (d) In addition to and without limiting the agreements of the parties
contained above, the Sellers and Purchaser shall:

             (i) take promptly all actions necessary to make the filings
      required of them or any of their Affiliates under the HSR Act,

             (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for
      additional information or documentary material received by the Sellers or
      Purchaser or any of their Affiliates from the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to
      the HSR Act or from any State Attorney General or other Governmental
      Entity in connection with antitrust matters,

             (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any filing under
      the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any investigation or other
      inquiry concerning the Transactions commenced by the FTC, DOJ, any State
      Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity;


                                       41
<Page>

             (iv) use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections,
      if any, as may be asserted with respect to the Transactions under any

             (v) advise the other parties promptly of any material communication
      received by such party from the FTC, DOJ, any State Attorney General or

      any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) such
      party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, DOJ, any State Attorney
      General or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the
      Transactions.

Concurrently with the filing of notifications under the HSR Act or as soon
thereafter as practicable, the Sellers and Purchaser shall each request early
termination of the HSR Act waiting period.

         (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other covenant herein
contained, in connection with the receipt of any necessary approvals under the
HSR Act, neither the Sellers nor any Target Subsidiary shall be entitled without
Purchaser's prior written consent or required to divest or hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Purchaser's freedom of
action with respect of, or its ability to retain, the Targeted Businesses or any
material portions thereof or any of the businesses, product lines, properties or
assets of the Targeted Businesses.

         (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other covenant herein
contained, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Purchaser to
divest or hold separate any assets or agree to limit its future activities,
method or place of doing business, to commence any litigation against any entity
in order to facilitate the consummation of any of the Transactions or to defend
against any litigation brought by any Governmental Entity seeking to prevent the
consummation of, or impose limitations on, any of the Transactions.

         (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other covenant herein

order to facilitate consummation of the Transactions or to resolve a challenge
to any of the Transactions on antitrust grounds, (i) to divest any assets other

divestitures that would result in the Sellers receiving an amount less than the

non-occurrence would be likely to cause either (A) any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time from the date hereof to the Closing Date or (B) any
condition set forth in Article VI to be unsatisfied in any material respect at
any time from the date hereof to the Closing Date and (ii) any failure of the
Sellers or any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or

following the delivery of such notice.

   Section 5.6 STOCK OPTIONS. The Board of Directors of Sylvan will take any and
all necessary actions to ensure that each unexpired and unexercised outstanding
option to purchase shares of Sylvan's common stock held by employees of the
Sellers who are retained by the Purchaser in connection with the Transactions,
will continue to vest as if such employees had continued to be employed by
Sylvan for a period of twelve months following the Closing Date, and will be
exercisable for twenty-four months following the Closing Date.

   Section 5.7 USE OF SYLVAN MARKS. Sellers agree that, except as expressly set

or mark "Sylvan", any other Trademark included in the Target Intellectual
Property, and any Trademarks related thereto or containing or comprising the
foregoing, including any Trademark confusingly similar thereto or dilutive
thereof (the "SYLVAN MARKS"), and (ii) represent itself as having any
affiliation with the Targeted Businesses; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the case
of any Seller or any Subsidiary of a Seller whose corporate, company or trade
name includes any Sylvan Mark, said Seller or Subsidiary of a Seller shall
have a period of 12 months to change its corporate, company or trade name to
a name that does not include any Sylvan Mark and to make any necessary legal
filings with the appropriate Governmental Authority to effectuate such
change. Any use of the Sylvan Marks by Sellers or their Subsidiaries pursuant
to this Section 5.7 shall be in conformity with the practices of Sellers as
of the Closing Date and shall be in a manner that does not in any material
way harm or disparage Purchaser or the reputation or goodwill of the Sylvan
Marks. At the written request of Purchaser, Sellers shall assign, or shall
cause the applicable Subsidiary to assign, to Purchaser any rights to any
Sylvan Marks that it may retain.

   Section 5.8 LIMITATION ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. Except as set forth
in Part 5.8 of the Disclosure Schedule, from the date hereof until the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any of their Subsidiaries to,

assets from, or enter into any contract, understanding, loan, advance or
guarantee with, or for the benefit of, an Affiliate of the Sellers (other than
Targeted Businesses) or any of their Subsidiaries (other than Target
Subsidiaries) (an "AFFILIATE TRANSACTION"), unless (a) such Affiliate
Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Targeted Businesses or
such Target Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable
transaction from an unrelated Person and (b) with respect to any Affiliate
Transaction (or series of related Affiliate Transactions) involving or having a
potential value of more than $500,000, in addition to compliance with clause
(a), such Affiliate Transaction shall also be approved by a majority of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Sylvan or the Board of
Managers of Ventures, as the case may be, after determining, in their reasonable
good faith judgment, that (i) such transaction is in the best interest of the
Targeted Businesses based on full disclosure of all relevant facts and
circumstances and (ii) such transaction is on fair and reasonable terms
competitive with those that could be obtained from an unrelated third party
(such approval and determination to be evidenced by a resolution of such
disinterested directors of the Board of Directors of Sylvan or the Board of
Managers of Ventures, as the case may be). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of this Section 5.8 shall not prevent the Sellers from entering into
this Agreement or any of the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

control of, or consult


                                       44
<Page>

with, a Seller Competing Business; PROVIDED, that the foregoing shall not
prohibit the Sellers or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Sellers from owning
as a passive investment 5% or less of the outstanding equity of any
publicly-traded entity, or the ownership by the Sellers or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of the Sellers of a Seller Competing Business that (i) constitutes a
portion of a business acquired by the Sellers or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of a
Seller and (ii) has revenues (together with those of any other Seller Competing
Business acquired by the Sellers or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of a Seller as
part of another business) of less than $25 million in the aggregate. In the
event that the revenues of any one or more Seller Competing Businesses equal or
exceed $25 million in the aggregate, Sellers shall, and shall cause such
Subsidiary or Affiliate to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to sell or
discontinue any such Seller Competing Businesses (or portions thereof) within 1
year following the acquisition of the Seller Competing Business that puts the
Sellers or such Subsidiary or Affiliate at or over the $25 million revenue
threshold such that after such sale or discontinuation, the Seller Competing
Businesses, in the aggregate, have revenues of less than $25 million. The
Sellers agree that the Sellers and Sellers' Subsidiaries and Affiliates will
not, for a period of one year after the Closing Date, solicit any person now
employed by the Sellers for the primary benefit of the Targeted Businesses for
employment by the Sellers if such Person is then employed by Purchaser or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of Purchaser. Purchaser agrees that the restrictions set

Sellers directed at the public in general in publications available to the
public in general or any contact which the Sellers can demonstrate through
written records was initiated by such employee.

         (b) Without the express prior written consent of the Sellers, neither
Purchaser nor any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Purchaser shall, at any time during
the three-year period immediately following the Closing Date, directly or
indirectly, own, manage, control or participate in the ownership, management or
control of, or consult with, a Purchaser Competing Business; PROVIDED, that the

aggregate, Purchaser shall, and shall cause such Subsidiary or Affiliate to, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to sell or discontinue any such Purchaser

Subsidiary or Affiliate at or over the $25 million revenue threshold, such that
after such sale or discontinuation, the Purchaser Competing Businesses, in the
aggregate, have revenues of less than $25 million. Purchaser agrees that
Purchaser and Purchaser's Subsidiaries and Affiliates will not, for a period of

Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Sellers. The Sellers agree that the restrictions
set forth in this subsection (b) above shall not apply to any solicitation by
Purchaser directed at the public in general in publications available to the
public in general or any contact which Purchaser can demonstrate through written
records was initiated by such employee. The activities of Apollo and its
portfolio companies and limited partners that are not subsidiaries of Holdings

title or interest in, to or under any or all of the Target Assets or otherwise
to carry out this Agreement, the Sellers shall execute and deliver all deeds,
bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, powers of attorney, assignments and

the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect
to this Agreement or the other Transactions without the written agreement of the
other party, except as may be required by law or by any listing agreement with a

the other party may reasonably request in examining or utilizing records

services provided for in this section. Each party agrees not to destroy any
files or records which are subject to this section without giving reasonable
notice to the other, and within fifteen days of receipt of such notice, such
other party may cause to be delivered to it the records intended to be
destroyed, at such other party's expense. Each party shall treat all information
received from the other parties pursuant to this Agreement with at least the
same care as it treats its own confidential information, and will not disclose

abandoned, dedicated to the public, or unenforceable except in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices and only as to Target
Intellectual Property which is not material.

         (b) Neither the Sellers nor any Target Subsidiary shall, with respect

at least substantially consistent with the quality of such products and services
as of the date hereof.

elects to tender to Sylvan less than 75% of the Convertible Debentures, it shall

such Lease after the Closing Date, then Sylvan shall pay to Purchaser all

relocation of the learning center subject to such Lease and in connection with
the execution and delivery of a new lease with substantially the same terms and
conditions as the Lease that was terminated or materially altered; or (z) all

same type.

         (c) If the Sellers do not obtain any requisite consent for the

within 12 months following the Closing Date, Sylvan shall pay Purchaser the
previous 12-month period Contribution Margin, MULTIPLIED BY a number that
represents the number of years the contractual relationship has existed with
Sylvan, rounded to the nearest whole number; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event
shall the multiplier be greater than five; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the
requisite Governmental Entity refuses to pay the amount due on the SES Contract
and expresses, as the reason for such refusal, the assignment contemplated by
this Agreement or the other Transactions, the Sellers will pay to Purchaser the

use its reasonable best efforts to collect the amount owed by such Governmental
Entity under such SES Contract and shall promptly remit the amount collected to
Sylvan.

use its reasonable best efforts to assist the Sellers in obtaining any consents

reaching an agreement regarding the matters set forth on Part 5.21 of the

not, despite Sylvan's and the Purchaser's good faith efforts, reach an
agreement.

         (a) From and after the Closing Date, Sylvan shall be liable for and
shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Persons harmless from and

(including interest and penalties recovered by a third party with respect
thereto and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and reasonable accountants'
fees and expenses incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same or
in asserting, preserving or enforcing any of the rights of Purchaser arising
under Article VIII) imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons (including, upon the Closing, the Target Subsidiaries),
directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from any and all Taxes imposed
upon the Target Subsidiaries or in respect of the Targeted Businesses with
respect or pursuant to (i) any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date (a "PRE-CLOSING PERIOD"), (ii) any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "STRADDLE PERIOD"), but only
with respect to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date and in the manner provided in Section 8.1(c) hereof (such portion,
a "PRE-CLOSING STRADDLE PERIOD"), (iii) Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any comparable provision under state, local or foreign law or regulation
imposing several liability upon members of a consolidated, combined, affiliated
or unitary group) for any Pre-Closing Period, (iv) a breach or inaccuracy in any
representation contained in Section 3.22 of this Agreement; PROVIDED, that
indemnification pursuant to this clause (iv) shall be subject to the limits
contained in Section 9.1(d)(ii), Section 9.1(d)(iii), Section 9.2 and Section
9.5, (v) breaches of any covenant of the Sellers set forth in this Article VIII,
Section 1.5 or Section 5.10(c) or (vi) Taxes other than Transfer Taxes
attributable to the Sellers and arising from the Transactions.

         (b) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be liable for
and shall indemnify and hold the Sellers and their Affiliates harmless from and
against all losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements and expenses
(including


                                       56
<Page>

interest and penalties recovered by a third party with respect thereto and
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and reasonable accountants' fees and
expenses incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same or in
asserting, preserving or enforcing any of the rights of the Sellers arising
under Article VIII) imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by the Sellers
or their Affiliates, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from any
and all Taxes imposed upon the Target Subsidiaries or in respect of the Targeted

of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, sales, gross receipts,
premiums, wages, capital expenditures or expenses, be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to income,
sales, gross receipts, premiums, wages, capital expenditures or expenses, be
deemed to be equal to the amount which would be payable if the Straddle Period
ended on and included the Closing Date.

   Section 8.2 TAX CLAIMS.

         (a) If Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing,
the Target Subsidiaries, receives any notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment,
adjustment, assessment audit, examination or other administrative or court
proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim (a "TAX CLAIM") asserted, commenced or
initiated against the Target Subsidiaries or the Targeted Businesses with
respect to a Pre-Closing Period, Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers of
the receipt of such Tax Claim and shall give the Sellers such information with
respect thereto as the Sellers may reasonably request provided, however, that
the failure to give such notice on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided herein except to the extent the indemnifying party has
been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Sellers
shall have the right to assume the defense (at the Sellers' expense) of any Tax
Claim asserted, commenced or initiated against the Target Subsidiaries or the
Targeted Businesses with respect to a Pre-Closing Period through counsel of
Sellers' own choosing by notifying Purchaser within twenty days of the receipt
by the Sellers of such notice from Purchaser provided, however, that any such
counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. The Sellers shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by Purchaser for any period
during which the Sellers have not assumed the defense of any such third-party
claim (other than during any period in which Purchaser will have failed to give
notice of the third-party claim as provided above). If the Sellers assume such
defense,


                                       57
<Page>

Purchaser shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Sellers, it being understood that the Sellers shall control such defense.
Sellers shall not enter into any settlement with respect to any such Tax Claim
without Purchaser's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

         (b) If any of the Sellers or their Affiliates receives any Tax Claim
asserted, commenced or initiated against the Target Subsidiaries or the Targeted
Businesses with respect to a Straddle Period or a Post-Closing Period, Sellers
shall promptly notify the Purchaser of the receipt of such Tax Claim and shall
give the Purchaser such information with respect thereto as the Purchaser may
reasonably request; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give such notice on a
timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided herein except to the
extent the indemnifying party has been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for
controlling the defense of any Tax Claim asserted, commenced or initiated
against the Target Subsidiaries or the Targeted Businesses with respect to (i) a
Straddle Period or a Post-Closing Period and (ii) a Pre-Closing Period to the
extent Sellers have failed to defend such Tax Claim, provided, however, that if
such Tax Claim relates to a Straddle Period, Sellers, may, at their own expense,
participate in such Tax Claim to the extent the matters raised in such Tax Claim
relate to Pre-Closing Straddle Periods. Purchaser shall not enter into any
settlement with respect to a Pre-Closing Period without the Sellers' prior
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Sellers
shall not have the right to control, defend, settle, compromise or contest any
Tax Claim to the extent that Purchaser and its Affiliates waives their right to
indemnification from the Sellers with respect to such Tax Claim.

expense and in a manner consistent with past practice, and duly file or cause to
be duly filed, all Tax returns with respect to the Target Subsidiaries and the
Targeted Businesses for Pre-Closing Periods, and shall be responsible for
remitting or causing to be remitted all Taxes reflected on such Tax returns. No
less than twenty Business Days prior to the earlier of the date on which each
such Tax return is filed or due to be filed (taking into account any applicable
extensions), copies of all such Tax returns (or the portion thereof relating to
the Target Subsidiaries) shall be furnished to Purchaser for its review and
comment.

         (b) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause
to be filed, on a timely basis, all Tax returns, other than the Tax returns
referred to in Section 8.3(a), with respect to the Target Subsidiaries and the
Targeted Businesses for Straddle Periods and Post-Closing Periods and shall be
responsible for remitting all Taxes reflected on such Tax returns. No less than
twenty Business Days prior to the earlier of the date on which each such Tax
return is filed or due to be filed (taking into account any


                                       58
<Page>

applicable extensions), Purchaser shall furnish to the Sellers copies of all
such Tax returns prepared and filed by Purchaser (or the relevant portion
thereof relating to the Target Subsidiaries) that include a Pre-Closing Straddle
Period for its review and comment. Upon Purchaser's written request, the Sellers
shall pay to Purchaser all Taxes due and payable with respect to any Tax return
for a Straddle Period to the extent such Taxes relate to a Pre-Closing Straddle
Period, as determined under Section 8.1(c). Sellers and Purchaser shall share in
the cost and expense payable to outside accountants or advisors for preparing
any Tax return for a Straddle Period, such cost and expense to be apportioned
among the Sellers and Purchaser in a manner consistent with the principles set
forth in Section 8.1(c).

         (c) Sellers shall be entitled to any Tax refunds attributable to any
Pre-Closing Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period provided, however, that
Purchaser shall be entitled to any such Tax refunds to the extent the refund
results from the carry back of a tax attribute from a Post-Closing Straddle
Period or a Post-Closing Period. Purchaser shall be entitled to any tax refunds
attributable to any Post-Closing Period or Post-Closing Straddle Period.

   Section 8.4 TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS; POWERS OF ATTORNEY. All (i) Tax sharing
agreements or similar agreements, written or unwritten (other than those
provided by this Agreement), with respect to or involving the Target
Subsidiaries or the Targeted Businesses and (ii) powers of attorney granted by
or on behalf of the Target Subsidiaries or the Targeted Businesses with respect
to any matter relating to Taxes shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and,
after the Closing Date, the Target Subsidiaries or the Targeted Businesses shall
not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

Section 8.5 TRANSFER TAXES. All Transfer Taxes arising out of, in connection
with or attributable to the Transactions shall be shared equally by Sellers on
the one hand and Purchaser on the other. The Transfer Tax Payor shall prepare
and timely file all relevant Tax returns required to be filed in respect of such
Transfer Tax (and will provide a copy of such Tax return to the other party for
review and comment at least 10 Business Days prior to filing), pay the Transfer
Tax shown on such Tax return, and notify the other party or parties in writing
of the Transfer Tax shown on such Tax return and how such Transfer Tax was
calculated, and the party or parties that did not pay the Transfer Tax shall
reimburse the Transfer Tax Payor for such party or parties share of the amount
of such Transfer Tax in immediately available funds within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt of such notice.

   Section 8.6 ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION. After the Closing, each of Purchaser
and the Sellers shall (a) cooperate fully in preparing any Tax returns and
preparing for any audits, disputes or litigation with any taxing authority
regarding any Tax returns of the Targeted Businesses or the Target Subsidiaries,
(b) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information and documents relating to Taxes of the Target
Subsidiaries or the Target Assets, (c) provide timely notice to the other in
writing of any pending or threatened Tax Claim for any taxable period for which
the other party may have liability under this Article VIII, and (d) furnish the

<Page>

in connection with any Tax Claim with respect to any taxable period for which
the other may have liability under this Article VIII.

   Section 8.7 CHARACTERIZATION OF INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS. All amounts paid by
the Sellers to Purchaser or its Affiliates or by Purchaser to the Sellers or its
Affiliates pursuant to this Article VIII or Article IX shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
obligations of the parties pursuant to this Article VIII and all representations

   Section 9.3 NOTICE OF CLAIM; DEFENSE. Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case
may be (the "INDEMNIFIED Party"), shall give the other party (the "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY") prompt notice of any third-party claim that may give rise to any
indemnification obligation under this Article IX, together with the estimated
amount of such claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume
the defense (at the Indemnifying Party's expense) of any such claim through
counsel of the Indemnifying Party's own choosing by so notifying the Indemnified
Party within 30 days of the first receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such
notice from the Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Failure to give such
notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations hereunder in the absence
of actual and material prejudice. If, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict with respect to any significant issue between any Purchaser
Indemnified Person or any Seller Indemnified Person, as the case may be, and the
Indemnifying Party exists in respect of such third-party claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel as
may be required to be retained in order to eliminate such conflict. If the
Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a third-party claim, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof, which
cooperation shall include, to the extent reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the retention, and the provision to the Indemnifying Party,
of records and information reasonably relevant to such third-party claim, and
making employees of the Targeted Businesses available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any materials
provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any
third-party claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of such third-party claim that the Indemnifying Party
may recommend and that, by its terms, discharges the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates from the full amount of liability in connection with such third-party
claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to, and
the Indemnified Party shall not be required to agree to, the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement that (i) provides for injunctive or other
non-monetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate of the
Indemnified Party, (ii) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving of a release from all liability with respect to such claim by each
claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party that is the subject of such
third-party claim, or (iii) contains any admission of wrongdoing by the Targeted
Businesses or any of their employees.

   Section 9.4 SURVIVAL OF INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS; OFFSET.

         (a) The indemnification obligations set forth in this Article IX and in
Article VIII shall survive the Closing. If agreed to by the Sellers or if a
Seller's obligation to pay such indemnification is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction and is final and nonappealable, Sellers' indemnification
obligations may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by offset against obligations
of Purchaser under the Seller Note delivered pursuant to this Agreement. If
exercised, such right of offset shall be applied, at Purchaser's option, to
either (a) the payment next due under the Seller Note after such


                                       62
<Page>

right of offset is asserted, and, to the extent necessary to satisfy such right
of offset, to subsequent payments due under the Seller Note in the chronological
order in which such payments are scheduled or (b) the outstanding principal
amount of the Seller Note.

         Section 9.5 EFFECT OF INVESTIGATION. The right to indemnification,
payment of Purchaser Losses or for other remedies based on any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation of the Sellers contained in or made pursuant to
this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect
to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation. Purchaser shall have no right of indemnification pursuant to Article
VIII or this Article IX with respect to any breach of a representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to the extent that Apollo (excluding Apollo
Sylvan, Apollo Sylvan II, Holdings and Purchaser) had actual knowledge of such
breach prior to the date hereof. The waiver of any condition to the obligation
of Purchaser to consummate the Transactions, where such condition is based on
the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Purchaser Losses, or other remedy based on such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

         Section 9.6 SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each
of the covenants, representations and warranties of the Sellers in this
Agreement or in any schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to
Articles III and V of this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and shall
continue in force thereafter as limited by Section 9.1(d), except the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.22 and all covenants
relating to Tax matters shall survive as provided in Article VIII.
