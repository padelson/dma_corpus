SECTION 2.02 Effective Time; Closing. As promptly as practicable and in no
event later than the second Business Day following the satisfaction or,
if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8 (or such
other date as may be agreed in writing by each of the parties hereto), the
parties hereto shall file, in order to consummate the Merger, a certificate
of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia (the "GEORGIA

Immediately prior to the filing of the Georgia Certificate of Merger, a

Scarborough LLP, 999 Peachtree Street, 14th Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30309 (or
such other place as the parties hereto may agree). The date on which the
Closing shall occur is referred to herein as the "CLOSING DATE."   SECTION
2.03 Effect of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the GBCC.  
SECTION 2.04 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) At the Effective Time,
the articles of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to contain the provisions set forth in the articles of
incorporation of Merger Sub, except that Article One thereof shall be amended
to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is InterCept, Inc." As so
amended, such articles of incorporation shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the GBCC.   (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the
Company shall be amended and restated in their entirety to contain the
provisions set forth in the bylaws of Merger Sub, until thereafter amended in
accordance with the GBCC.   SECTION 2.05 Directors and Officers.   (a) At

Surviving Corporation shall be the individuals set forth on Schedule 2.05(b)
of the Parent Disclosure Letter until the earlier of their death, disability,
resignation or removal, or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified.   ARTICLE 3   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES   SECTION 3.01 Conversion of Securities.   (a) Conversion of
Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, FNIS, Merger Sub, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:   (1) Each issued and
outstanding share of Company Preferred  Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall be converted into Company
Common Stock pursuant to, and at the  conversion price, set forth in the
Company Preferred Stock  designation.   (2) Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including those  shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the conversion
of the  Company Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 3.01(a)(1) (all 
such issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock being  hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "SHARES," other than any  Shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(3) and any  Dissenting Shares), shall be
converted into, as provided in and  subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement and the  election and allocation procedures set forth in this
Section 3.01,  the right to receive at the election of the holder thereof
as  provided in this Section 3.01 (x) the number of Parent Common Shares 
equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "STOCK CONSIDERATION") or (y)  $18.90 in
cash (the "CASH CONSIDERATION"). The Cash Consideration  and the Stock
Consideration, on a per share basis, are referred to  herein as the "PER
SHARE MERGER CONSIDERATION." At the Effective  Time, each Share shall cease
to be outstanding and cease to exist  and each holder of Shares shall
thereafter cease to have any rights  with respect to such Shares, except the
right to receive, as  applicable and without interest, Parent Common Shares
and cash in  accordance with this Section 3.01 and cash for fractional
Parent  Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.02(e).   (3) Each Share
held in the treasury of the Company and each  Share owned by Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned  Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company
immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any  conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made
with  respect thereto.   11    (4) All shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into  fully-paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, no par value,  of
the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Certain Adjustments. If between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time:   (1) the outstanding Parent Common
Shares shall have been  changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by  reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification,  recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares
or any  similar event, the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted 
to the extent appropriate to reflect such stock dividend,  subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination  or exchange of shares
or similar event; or   (2) the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall  have been changed into a different number of shares or a different 
class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,  reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange  of shares or any similar
event, the Exchange Ratio and the Cash  Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted to the extent  appropriate to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision,  reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange  of shares or similar event.   (c) Elections by
Holder of Shares. Subject to the election and allocation procedures set forth
in this Section 3.01, each holder of Shares will be entitled with respect to
the Shares held by such holder, to (i) elect to receive the Stock
Consideration for all of the Shares held by such holder (a "STOCK ELECTION"),
(ii) elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all of the Shares held by
such holder (a "CASH ELECTION") or (iii) elect to receive the Stock
Consideration for a portion of such holder\'s Shares and the
Cash Consideration for the remaining portion of such holder\'s Shares (a
"MIXED ELECTION").   (d) Number of Shares Subject to Election. The number
of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration in the Merger shall be equal to 25% of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "STOCK CONVERSION NUMBER"). Shares of Company Common Stock as to
which a holder has elected to receive the Cash Consideration (whether
pursuant to a Cash Election or a Mixed Election) are referred to as "CASH
ELECTION SHARES" and the aggregate number of Shares as to which such election
has been made are referred to as the "CASH ELECTION NUMBER." Shares of
Company Common Stock as to which a holder has elected to receive the Stock
Consideration (whether pursuant to a Stock Election or a Mixed Election) are
referred to as "STOCK ELECTION SHARES," and the aggregate number of Shares as
to which such election has been made are referred to as the "STOCK ELECTION
NUMBER." Shares of Company Common Stock as to which no election has been made
are referred to as "NON-ELECTION SHARES" and the aggregate number of Shares
as to which no such election has been made are referred to as the "NON-
ELECTION NUMBER."   12    (e) Election Adjustments.   (1) If the Stock
Election Number exceeds the Stock  Conversion Number, then all Cash Election
Shares and all  Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the  Cash Consideration, and, subject to Section 3.02(e), each holder
of  Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the Stock 
Consideration only with respect to that number of Stock Election  Shares held
by such holder (rounded to the nearest whole share)  equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock  Election Shares held by such
holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator  of which shall be the Stock
Conversion Number and the denominator of  which shall be the Stock Election
Number, with the remaining number  of such holder\'s Stock Election Shares
being converted into the  right to receive the Cash Consideration.   (2) If
the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock  Conversion Number (the
amount by which the Stock Conversion Number  exceeds the Stock Election
Number being referred to herein as the  "SHORTFALL NUMBER"), then all Stock
Election Shares shall be  converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration and the  Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be
treated in the  following manner:   (A) if the Shortfall Number is less
than or equal to  the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election 
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash  Consideration
and, subject to Section 3.02(e), each holder of  Non-Election Shares shall
receive the Stock Consideration in  respect of that number of Non-Election
Shares held by such  holder (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to
the  product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election  Shares
held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of  which is the
Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is  the total number of Non-
Election Shares, with the remaining  number of such holder\'s Non-Election
Shares being converted  into the right to receive the Cash Consideration,
or   (B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of  Non-Election
Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be  converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration,  and, subject to Section 3.02(e), each
holder of Cash Election  Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in
respect of  that number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder 
(rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product  obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares  held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which  is the amount by which (1) the
Shortfall Number exceeds (2)  the total number of Non-Election Shares and the
denominator of  which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the 
remaining number of such holder\'s Cash Election Shares being  converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration.   13    (f) Exercise of
Election. All Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed Elections shall be
made on a form designed for that purpose and mutually acceptable to the
Company and Parent (a "FORM OF ELECTION") and mailed to holders of record of
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock as of the record
date for the Company Shareholders\' Meeting or such other date as Parent and
the Company shall mutually agree (the "ELECTION FORM RECORD DATE"). Parent
and the Company shall make available one or more Election Forms as may be
reasonably requested by all persons who become holders (or beneficial owners)
of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the close
of business on the day prior to the Election Deadline. Elections shall
be made by submitting to the Exchange Agent a Form of Election. To be
effective, a Form of Election must be properly completed, signed and
submitted to the Exchange Agent in accordance with Section 3.01(g) and
accompanied by the Certificates representing the shares of Company Common
Stock (or, if applicable, shares of Company Preferred Stock being converted
to Shares as provided in this Agreement) as to which the election is being
made (or an appropriate guarantee of delivery by an appropriate trust company
in the United States or a member of a registered national securities exchange
or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.). Parent will have
the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange
Agent, to reasonably determine whether Forms of Election have been properly
completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard immaterial
defects in Forms of Election. The decision of Parent (or the Exchange Agent)
in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Parent nor the
Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange
Agent shall also make all computations contemplated by this Section 3.01 and
all such computations shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock.   (g) Election Deadline. A
Form of Election must be received by the Exchange Agent by the close of
business one Business Day prior to the Company Shareholders\' Meeting (such
time hereinafter referred to as the "ELECTION DEADLINE") in order to be
effective. Any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock who
has made an election by submitting a Form of Election to the Exchange Agent
may at any time prior to the Election Deadline change such holder\'s election
by submitting a revised Form of Election, properly completed and signed that
is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. Any holder
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock may at any time prior to
the Election Deadline revoke his election and withdraw his Certificates
deposited with the Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent
received prior to the Election Deadline.   (h) Deemed Non-Election. For the
purposes hereof, a holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
who does not submit a Form of Election which is received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline shall be deemed to hold Non-Election
Shares. If Parent or the Exchange Agent shall determine that any purported
Cash Election or Stock Election was not properly made, such purported Cash
Election or Stock Election shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and
the Shares subject to such election shall for all purposes hereof be deemed
to be Non-Election Shares.   14    SECTION 3.02 Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent shall enter into an agreement (reasonably satisfactory to the Company
and reflecting the terms hereof) with the Exchange Agent. Promptly following
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for
exchange in accordance with this Article 3 through the Exchange Agent, (x)
certificates representing the number of Parent Common Shares issuable
pursuant to Section 3.01 and (y) the amount of cash payable pursuant to
Section 3.01 as of the Effective Time and cash from time to time as required
to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.02(e)
(such cash and certificates for Parent Common Shares, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto and together with such cash
as may be required to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares, being
hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND"). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver (x) the Parent Common Shares
and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 3.01 and (y) such cash
as may be required to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares out of
the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 3.02(f) hereof, the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.   (b) Exchange
Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than two Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the "CERTIFICATES") (1) a letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (2) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for cash
and certificates representing Parent Common Shares (each as pursuant to
Section 3.01) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares. Upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (x) that amount of cash and a
certificate representing that number of whole Parent Common Shares that such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Shares formerly represented
by such Certificate (after taking into account all Shares then held by such
holder) pursuant to Section 3.01; (y) cash in lieu of any fractional Parent
Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(e);
and (z) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.02(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the amount of cash
and a certificate representing the number of Parent Common Shares to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01, cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(c) may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation that any applicable
share transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 3.02, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing  
15   Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at all times after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender that amount
of cash and a certificate representing that number of Parent Common Shares to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01, cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(c).   (c) Distributions with Respect
to Unexchanged Parent Common Shares. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to the Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the Parent Common Shares entitled to be received upon surrender
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares shall be paid
to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.02(e), until the holder of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate as provided in Section 3.02(b).
Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole Parent Common Shares issued in exchange
therefor (in addition to any Cash Consideration paid in respect of such
Certificate), without interest, (x) the amount of any cash payable with
respect to a fractional Parent Common Share to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.02(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and
theretofore payable with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares; and (y)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such whole Parent Common Shares.   (d) No Further Rights in Company
Common Stock. All Parent Common Shares issued and cash paid upon conversion
of the Shares in accordance with the terms hereof and any cash paid pursuant
to Sections 3.02(c) or (e) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.   (e) No
Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent
Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each
holder of a fractional share interest shall be paid in lieu of receiving any
fractional Parent Common Shares an amount in cash (without interest and
rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) such fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all fractional share interests then held by such holder)
would otherwise be entitled by (y) the average closing price per share of
Parent Common Shares for the ten most recent days that Parent Common Shares
have traded ending on (and including) the trading day one day prior to the
Effective Time, as reported on the Parent Stock Market (with such average
being calculated using the "simple average" methodology) (the "PARENT MARKET
PRICE"). As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the
Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount
with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward
payments to such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms of Sections 3.02(b) and (c).   16    (f)
Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of Shares for six months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who
have not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for the cash and Parent Common Shares to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.01, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares
to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(e) and any dividends or
other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Shares to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(c). Any portion of the Exchange
Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date that is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (g) No Liability. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any Parent Common
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.   (h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be.   (i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation or Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate and the
payment of any fee charged by the Exchange Agent for such service, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the amount of cash and number of Parent Common Shares to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01, any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Shares to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(c).   SECTION 3.03
Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the   17   Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be
canceled in exchange for the amount of the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
3.01, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(e) and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 3.02(c).   SECTION 3.04 Company Stock Options.   (a) (1)
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all options to acquire Company
Common Stock then outstanding (the "COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS"), whether or not
exercisable and whether or not vested, under the Company Stock Option Plans
shall vest; and (2) at the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each of the
Company Stock Option Plans and the Company Stock Options. Each Company Stock
Option granted under the 1994 Plan, the 1996 Plan, the Acquisition Plan, the
2002 Plan and the Boggs Plan shall terminate 90 days after the Effective Time
unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms; provided,
however, that the Company Stock Options disclosed in Schedule 3.04(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall not terminate as of such 90th day but shall
continue in effect for the period provided in the applicable stock option
agreements, employment agreements and change in control agreements listed in
such schedule. Subject to the proviso in the preceding sentence, each Company
Stock Option assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (A) each Company Stock Option will
be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for
that number of whole Parent Common Shares (rounded up to the nearest whole
share) equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio; and (B) the
per share exercise price for the Parent Common Shares issuable upon exercise
of such assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to (x) the exercise price
per share of such Company Stock Option in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio (the exercise price per
share, as so determined, being rounded upward to the nearest full cent). At
or before the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be effected any
necessary amendments to the Company Stock Option Plans and shall provide any
necessary notices to give effect to the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.04. Except to the extent accelerated vesting would adversely affect the
qualification of a Company Stock Option as an incentive stock option
as defined in Section 422 of the Code, it is the intention of the parties
that each Company Stock Option assumed by Parent shall qualify following the
Effective Time as an incentive stock option to the extent permitted under
Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such option qualified as an
incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time.   (b) As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event not later than 15 days
following the Effective Time), Parent shall deliver to each Person who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a holder of an outstanding
Company Stock Option assumed by Parent under this Section 3.04 an appropriate
notice setting forth such holder\'s rights pursuant thereto and that the
agreements evidencing the grants of such options shall continue in effect
on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by
this Section 3.04 after giving effect to the Merger). At or before the
Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares for delivery upon
exercise of Company Stock Options assumed pursuant to this Section 3.04.
As   18   soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event
not later than 15 days following the Effective Time), Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) that will register
the Parent Common Shares subject to assumed Company Stock Options to the
extent permitted by federal securities laws and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements for so long as such options remain outstanding. In
addition, Parent shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent
Common Shares subject to assumed Company Stock Options to be listed on the
Parent Stock Market and such exchanges as Parent shall determine.   (c)
Outstanding purchase rights under the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "COMPANY PURCHASE PLAN") shall be exercised upon the earlier of (1) the
next regularly scheduled purchase date under the Company Purchase Plan after
the date hereof or (2) immediately prior to the Effective Time (the earlier
of (1) and (2), the "CPP SUSPENSION DATE"), and each participant in
the Company Purchase Plan shall accordingly be issued shares of Company
Common Stock at that time pursuant to the terms of the Company Purchase Plan
in effect as of the date hereof. Each share of Company Common Stock so issued
shall by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive cash or Parent Common
Shares in accordance with Section 3.01(a)(2) and cash for fractional Parent
Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.02(e). The Company shall cause the
Company Purchase Plan to be suspended as of the CPP Suspension Date and
terminated as of the Effective Time. The Company shall take all action
necessary to prohibit Persons who are not participants in the Company
Purchase Plan as of the date hereof from becoming participants on or after
the date hereof, and to prohibit participants from increasing their purchase
elections or payroll deductions from those in effect on the date hereof, if
and to the extent such actions may be taken in accordance with the terms of
the Company Purchase Plan and the purchase rights outstanding thereunder,
and, to the greatest extent reasonably practicable, without causing the
Company Purchase Plan or any purchase rights thereunder to cease to meet the
requirements of Section 423 of the Code.   SECTION 3.05 Dissenting
Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive the applicable Parent Common Shares and cash. Such
shareholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares of Company Common Stock held by them in accordance with the GBCC,
unless and until such shareholders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or
otherwise lose their appraisal rights under the GBCC. All Shares held by
shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such Shares under the GBCC
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, the Stock Consideration or a combination thereof as determined
by Parent in its sole discretion, without any interest thereon, together with
any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 3.02(c) to which
such holder is entitled and cash in lieu of fractional shares, without any
interest thereon, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
3.02(e), upon the surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.02, of the
corresponding Certificate.   19    (b) The Company shall give Parent (1)
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments served
pursuant to the GBCC and received by the Company and (2) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the GBCC. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.   ARTICLE 3A   ALTERNATIVE
STRUCTURE AS ALL CASH TRANSACTION   Notwithstanding Article 3 and the
structure of the Merger described therein and elsewhere in this Agreement,
the parties agree that Parent shall have the right to elect, by giving
written notice to the Company at any time prior to the mailing of the Proxy
Statement for the Company Shareholders\' Meeting, to pay the entire Per Share
Merger Consideration in cash rather than partly in cash and partly in Parent
Common Shares. In that event, (i) the parties shall amend this Agreement
accordingly to eliminate the Stock Consideration, the Affiliate Agreements,
and the provisions regarding the Registration Statement; and to revise or
delete any other provisions of this Agreement as are necessary and
appropriate to reflect the foregoing election; (ii) Parent shall withdraw the
Registration Statement; (iii) the Company shall amend and file the Proxy

to the exceptions set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter. The
Company Disclosure Letter shall be arranged according to specific sections in
this Article 4 and shall provide exceptions to, or otherwise qualify in

and authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation or organization to do business,   20   and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased, licensed or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions

standing (individually or in the aggregate) would not reasonably be likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.01(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any

authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each such share
or other equity interest owned by the Company or another Company Subsidiary
is free and clear of all Liens, pledges, options, rights of first refusal,
agreements, limitations on voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of
any nature whatsoever. The Company directly owns 100% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock or other equity interests, and all options or other

counterclaim or  impleader) any litigation or other action before an
arbitrator or  other Governmental Entity against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries  or involving or affecting their assets (other than in
connection  with the enforcement of rights and obligations hereunder);  
(17) take any action that would, or that would reasonably be  likely to, (i)
result in any representation or warranty made by the  Company becoming untrue
or inaccurate such that the condition set  forth in Section 8.02(a) would not
be satisfied or (ii) result in  any other condition set forth in Article 6
not being satisfied; or   (18) authorize, or agree in writing or otherwise
to take, any  of the actions described in Section 6.01(b)(1) through (17)
above.   SECTION 6.02 Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the
Merger. Parent agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, except as set forth in Schedule 6.02 of the Parent Disclosure
Letter or as specifically contemplated by any other provision of this
Agreement, unless the Company shall otherwise consent in writing, Parent
shall not take any action that would, or that would reasonably be likely to
(i) result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Parent, FNIS or Merger Sub to perform its
obligations hereunder or to consummate the Merger; provided, however, the
effects of any acquisition by Parent completed after the date hereof or
proposed prior to or after the date hereof shall not be deemed, in and of
itself, to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect for purposes of Section
6.02(i).   51    SECTION 6.03 Notification of Certain Matters. Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, orally and in writing, to the extent that such party has
Knowledge of: (a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence
or nonoccurrence of which would be likely to cause (1) any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement made by it (and in the case of Parent,
made by FNIS or Merger Sub) to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect or (2) any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this
Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied by it (and in the case of
Parent, by FNIS or Merger Sub) in any material respect; and (b) any failure
or inability of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it (and in the case of Parent, by FNIS or Merger Sub) hereunder; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, the conditions to
the obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger or the
remedies available hereunder to Parent or the Company, as the case may
be.   SECTION 6.04 Cooperation Regarding IPO of FNIS. The
Company recognizes that FNIS may make an initial public offering of shares of
its common stock (the "IPO") prior to the Effective Time. The Company will
cooperate as reasonably necessary with FNIS in the IPO, including providing
information and historical financial statements for use in any registration
statement or prospectus for the IPO and obtaining the cooperation of the
Company\'s accountants in connection therewith; provided, however, that
Parent and FNIS shall cooperate to the extent reasonably practicable so that
the IPO does not unreasonably delay the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement and thus cause the Company Shareholders\' Meeting to be
unreasonably delayed.   ARTICLE 7   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   SECTION 7.01
Registration Statement; Proxy Statement.   (a) As promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, (1) the Company shall prepare, in
consultation with Parent, and file with the SEC a proxy statement (together
with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "PROXY STATEMENT")
relating to the meeting of the Company\'s shareholders (the "COMPANY
SHAREHOLDERS\' MEETING") to be held to consider approval of the Merger and
adoption of this Agreement, and (2) Parent shall prepare, in consultation
with the Company, and file with the SEC the Registration Statement in which
the Proxy Statement shall be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Shares to be
issued to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to become effective as promptly as practicable and,
prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take all or any reasonable action required
under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
Parent Common Shares pursuant to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning itself as the other may reasonably
request in connection with such actions and the preparation of
the Registration Statement and   52   Proxy Statement. As promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become effective, the
Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to its shareholders.   (b) The Proxy
Statement shall include the recommendation of the board of directors of the
Company to the shareholders of the Company to vote in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and, subject to Section 7.01(c), neither the board of
directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold,
withdraw, amend, modify or change, or propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or change, in each case in a manner adverse
to Parent, the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company that
the Company\'s shareholders adopt this Agreement (ii) approve any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
similar agreement relating to any Competing Transaction or (iii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Competing Transaction.
Subject to Parent\'s termination rights under Section 9.01(c), nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors of the
Company from fulfilling its duty of candor or disclosure to the shareholders
of the Company under applicable law or from taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act; provided that, except as permitted under Section
7.01(c), the Company does not withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or change its
recommendation in favor of the Merger or approve or recommend any Competing
Transaction.   (c) If a Superior Proposal shall have been made to the
Company and shall not have been withdrawn, then prior to the Company Common
Shareholder Approval, the Company\'s board of directors may (x) withhold,
withdraw, amend, modify or change its recommendation in favor of the Merger
or (y) terminate this Agreement in order to enter into an agreement for such
Superior Proposal (provided that prior to such termination, (i) the Waiting
Period referred to below shall have lapsed and (ii) the Company shall have
paid the Termination Fee and acknowledged its obligation to pay the Parent\'s
Expense Reimbursement) if: (1) the Company shall have provided written notice
to Parent as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within one Business
Day) advising Parent that the Company has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal in reasonable
detail and identifying the Person or entity making such Superior Proposal
and, if in writing, providing a copy of such Superior Proposal (a "NOTICE OF
SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"); (2) Parent shall not have, within five Business Days of
Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal (the "WAITING PERIOD"),
made an offer that the Company\'s board of directors determines in its good
faith judgment to be at least as favorable to the Company and its
shareholders as such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that the Company\'s
board of directors shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by
Parent promptly following the receipt thereof); (3) the board of directors of
the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior
Proposal, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment, modification or change of
such recommendation, or the termination of this Agreement and entry into such
agreement for a Superior Proposal, is required in order for the board of
directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to
the Company and its shareholders under applicable Law, after taking into
account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
following its receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal; and (4) the Company
shall not have violated any of the restrictions set forth in Section 7.04 or
this Section 7.01(c). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Parent with at least two Business Days\' notice of any
meeting of the Company\'s   53   board of directors at which the
Company\'s board of directors is reasonably expected to consider any
Competing Transaction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior
to the Company Common Shareholder Approval, the Company\'s board of directors
may withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or change its recommendation in favor
of the Merger if the board of directors of the Company concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that the withholding, withdrawal, amendment, modification or
change of such recommendation is required in order for the board of directors
of the Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company and
its shareholders under applicable Law.   (d) Unless this Agreement has been
terminated, nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit the Company\'s
obligation to convene and hold the Company Shareholders\' Meeting (regardless
of whether the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have been withheld, withdrawn, amended, modified or
changed).   (e) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without
the approval of the other party (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Each of Parent and the Company will advise the other,
promptly after it receives notice thereof (providing a copy of any written
materials), of the time at which the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of
any stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. The parties shall
consult with each other (including providing drafts in advance of filing) in
the preparation of any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement
or Proxy Statement and in responding to any requests from or comments of the
SEC.   (f) The information supplied by Parent for inclusion in
the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement shall not, at: (1) the
time the Registration Statement is declared effective; (2) the time the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
the shareholders of the Company; (3) the time of the Company Shareholders\'
Meeting; and (4) the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to Parent, or
its officers or directors, that should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement should be
discovered by Parent, Parent shall promptly inform the Company. All documents
that Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act; provided, however, that the foregoing
does not cover any of the information referred to in the first sentence of
Section 7.01(g).   (g) The information supplied by the Company for inclusion
in the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement shall not, at: (1) the
time the Registration Statement is   54   declared effective; (2) the
time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is
first mailed to the shareholders of the Company; (3) the time of the Company
Shareholders\' Meeting; and (4) the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or fail to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or their respective officers or
directors, that should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Registration Statement or Proxy Statement should be discovered by the
Company, the Company shall promptly inform Parent. All documents that
the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act; provided, however, that the foregoing
does not cover any of the information referred to in the first sentence of
Section 7.01(f).   SECTION 7.02 Company Shareholders\' Meeting. The Company
shall: (1) call and hold the Company Shareholders\' Meeting as promptly as
practicable for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement;
(2) use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Company Shareholders\'
Meeting as soon as practicable after the date on which the Registration
Statement becomes effective; and (3) in any event hold such Company
Shareholders\' Meeting within 45 days after the date on which the
Registration Statement becomes effective. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of
the approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement, and shall take all
other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
shareholders required by the rules of The Nasdaq National Market and the
GBCC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees
that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.02(a)
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company of any proposal or offer for a Competing
Transaction; provided, however, that if the Company\'s board of directors
withholds, withdraws, amends, modifies or changes its recommendation in favor
of the Merger pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.01(c) hereof, with
the result that the Company\'s board of directors no longer recommends that
the Company\'s shareholders vote in favor of the Merger, then the obligations
of the Company set forth in the second sentence of this Section 7.02 shall be
limited to holding the Company Shareholders\' Meeting and mailing
proxy materials to its shareholders in that regard, with no duty to seek to
encourage votes in favor of the Merger.   SECTION 7.03 Access to
Information; Confidentiality.   (a) Except as required pursuant to any
confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or arrangement to which the
Company or any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries is a party or pursuant to
applicable Law, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (1) provide
Parent (and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, investment bankers,
advisors, agents and other representatives (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES"))
access at reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees,
agents, properties, offices and other facilities of it and its Subsidiaries
and to the books and records thereof and (2) furnish promptly such
information concerning the business, properties,   55   contracts,
assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of it and its Subsidiaries
as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request; provided that the
Company shall not be required to furnish any information about any Legal
Proceeding that is pending, or to the Knowledge of such party
threatened, against such party or any Subsidiary or property or asset of such
Subsidiary if in the reasonable judgment of such party after consulting with
its outside counsel, furnishing such information would reasonably be expected
to prejudice materially the rights of such party, its Subsidiaries, officers,
directors or Affiliates to assert an attorney-client privilege with respect
thereto in such Legal Proceeding or any related Legal Proceeding.   (b) The
parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives
to comply with, all of their obligations under the Non-Disclosure Agreement.
All information obtained by the parties pursuant to (a) above shall be
subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement.   (c) No investigation pursuant to
this Section 7.03 shall affect any representation or warranty in this
Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto to
consummate the Merger.   SECTION 7.04 No Solicitation of Transactions.  
(a) Following the date hereof, the Company will not, directly or indirectly,
and will instruct its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (1)
solicit, initiate or encourage (including by means of furnishing nonpublic
information), or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any
proposal or offer to its shareholders) with respect to, or that reasonably
may be expected to lead to a proposal or offer for, any Competing
Transaction, (2) enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate
with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a Competing
Transaction or (3) authorize or permit any of its Representatives to take any
such action. The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours)
notify Parent if any proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with any
Person with respect thereto, regarding a Competing Transaction is made, and
the Company shall promptly inform Parent as to the material details of any
such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact, including, without limitation, the
identity of the party making any such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact,
and, if in writing, promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent a
copy of such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact. The Company shall keep
Parent informed in all material respects of the status and material terms
(including any material changes therein) of any such proposal, offer or
inquiry and provide Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof (but in no event later than 24 hours) with copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company
from any third party in connection therewith. The Company immediately shall
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing
Transaction. The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any
provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a
party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.04, prior
to the Company Common Shareholder Approval, the Company\'s board of directors
may furnish information to, and enter into discussions or negotiations (or
waive any confidentiality restrictions in a standstill agreement that
would otherwise restrict the foregoing) with, a Person who has made an
unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer regarding a Competing  
56   Transaction only if the Company\'s board of directors has: (1)
concluded, in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisor that such proposal or offer constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal; (2) concluded, in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Competing Transaction,
the furnishing of such information or entering into discussions is required
to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company and its shareholders
under applicable Law; (3) provided written notice to Parent of its intent to
furnish information or enter into discussions or negotiations with such
Person at least three Business Days prior to taking any such action; and (4)
obtained from such Person an executed confidentiality and standstill
agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in
the Non-Disclosure Agreement; provided, however, that no information may be
furnished and no discussions may be entered into in the event that the
Company has breached this Section 7.04(a); and provided further, however,
that the Company\'s board of directors shall furnish to Parent all
information provided to the Person who has made the proposal or offer
regarding the Competing Transaction to the extent that such information has
not been previously provided to Parent.   (b) A "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means an
unsolicited written bona fide offer or proposal made by a third party to
consummate a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, sale or disposition or similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which a Person (or its shareholders) would
own, if consummated, all or substantially all of the outstanding capital
stock of the Company (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or
indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially
all the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole
that is (1) not attributable to a breach by the Company of Section 7.04(a)
hereof and (2) on terms (including conditions to consummation of the
contemplated transaction) that the board of directors of the
Company determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the
Company\'s counsel and the Company\'s independent financial advisor), to be
more favorable to the Company\'s shareholders from a financial point of view
than the terms of the Merger and with any financing required to consummate
the transaction contemplated by such offer or proposal committed.   SECTION
7.05 Letters of the Company\'s Accountants. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent
two letters from the Company\'s independent public accountants, one dated a
date within two Business Days before the date on which the Registration
Statement shall become effective and one dated a date within two Business
Days before the Closing Date, each addressed to Parent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and substance for
comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement. The
Company shall provide all reasonable cooperation to the Company\'s
independent public accountants to enable them to issue the letters referred
to in this Section 7.05.   SECTION 7.06 Indemnification and Insurance of
Directors, Officers, Employees and Agents.   (a) All rights of current or
former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries who at any time prior to the Effective Time were entitled to
indemnification, advancement or exculpation under the articles of
incorporation or   57    bylaws of the Company (or under any written
agreement to which the Company is a party) in respect of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a
period of not less than six years from the Effective Time unless such
modification is required by Law.   (b) After the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or becomes
such prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") against all costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacities as
officers or directors or in connection with their serving at the Company\'s
request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan, or other enterprise, in each case occurring on or before the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the full
extent required under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company
(or under any written agreement to which the Company is a party); provided,
however, that (i) such indemnification shall only be to the fullest extent a
corporation is permitted under the GBCC to indemnify its own directors and
officers, and (ii) if the Surviving Corporation (x) is unable to meet
its indemnification obligations hereunder and (y) has total shareholders\'
equity calculated in accordance with GAAP of less than $220 million, then an
Affiliate of Parent, of FNIS or of the Surviving Corporation (which may be
FNIS) having shareholders\' equity of at least $220 million shall thereupon
assume and pay such indemnification obligations; provided, that if no such
Affiliate assumes and pays such obligations, then Parent shall do so.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, FNIS, nor any Affiliate of the Surviving
Corporation, FNIS or Parent shall have any further obligation to make any
payment under this Section 7.06(b) if the aggregate of all payments made
after the date of this Agreement for the benefit of Indemnified Parties
pursuant to (i) the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, (ii) agreements to which the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation is a party and
(iii) this Section 7.06(b) exceeds $220 million. The preceding sentence shall
not be understood to imply that Parent expects that payments will be made
under any of the foregoing for the benefit of Indemnified Parties and shall
not limit or in any way affect Parent\'s rights under any other provision of
this Agreement, including Sections 8.02 and 9.01. Nothing contained herein
shall make any such Affiliate, Parent, FNIS, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation an insurer, a co-insurer or an excess insurer
in respect of any insurance policies that may provide coverage for any of
the foregoing, nor shall this Section 7.06 relieve the obligations of any
insurer in respect thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (1) the Surviving
Corporation shall advance or pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
selected by any Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements therefor
are received (unless the Surviving Corporation shall elect to defend such
action) and (2) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of
any such matter; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not
be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which  
58    consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 7.06,
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify an
indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have
under this Section 7.06 except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such party), and shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation the
undertaking contemplated by Section 14-2-853(a)(2) of the GBCC. The
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them
with respect to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards
of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.   (c) Effective at
Closing, the Company shall obtain a prepaid insurance and indemnification
policy with a term of up to six years providing the Company\'s current (and
if available, former) directors and officers with coverage for events that
occurred prior to the Effective Time, including in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "DandO; INSURANCE"). The total
amount paid for such DandO; Insurance shall not exceed $1,500,000 (the "MAXIMUM
AMOUNT"). In the event that the total premiums for such directors\' and
officers\' insurance and indemnification policy exceed the Maximum Amount,
the Company shall purchase such coverage as may be purchased at a cost equal
to the Maximum Amount.   (d) This Section 7.06 is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving
Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event Parent, the Company,
FNIS or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns (1) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (2) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent, the Company, FNIS or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, honor their respective indemnification
obligations set forth in this Section 7.06.   SECTION 7.07 Obligations of
Merger Sub. Each of Parent and FNIS shall take all action necessary to cause
Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.   SECTION 7.08 Affiliate Agreements. At least thirty days prior
to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all
Persons who are, at the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by
the shareholders of the Company, an Affiliate of the Company for purposes of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to
the Effective Time, the affiliate agreement, in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "AFFILIATE AGREEMENT"), executed by each of
the Affiliates of the Company identified in the foregoing letter and any
Person who shall, to the Knowledge of the Company, have become an Affiliate
of the Company subsequent to the delivery of such list. The foregoing
notwithstanding, Parent shall be entitled to place legends as specified in
the Affiliate Agreement on the certificates evidencing any of the Parent
Common Shares to be received by any such Affiliate, and to issue stop
transfer instructions to the transfer agent for Parent Common Shares,
consistent with the   59    term of the Affiliate Agreement, regardless
of whether such Affiliate has executed the Affiliate Agreement.   SECTION
7.09 Further Action; Consents; Filings.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts: (1) to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (2) to obtain from
Governmental Entities and third parties any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made
by Parent, the Company or any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (3) to make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any
other submissions, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required under (A) the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act and any other applicable federal or state
securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and foreign antitrust regulations, if any,
applicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder
and (C) any other applicable Law. The parties hereto shall cooperate with
each other in connection with the making of all such filings.   (b) Parent
and the Company shall, as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, file notifications under the HSR Act and make any required
antitrust filings in foreign jurisdictions and shall respond as promptly as
practicable to all inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade
Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
for additional information or documentation and shall respond as promptly
as practicable to all inquiries and requests received from any state
attorney general or other Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust
matters. The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings or responses. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to agree to reach
any agreement that (i) seeks to prohibit or limit the ownership or operation
by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any
material portion of the business or assets of the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or to compel the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any material
portion of the business or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, as a result of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereunder, (ii) seeks to impose limitations on the ability of
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to acquire or hold, or exercise full
rights of ownership of, any shares of the Company Common Stock, including the
right to vote the Company Common Stock purchased by it on all matters
properly presented to the stockholders of the Company, (iii) seeks
to prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from effectively controlling in
any material respect the business or operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or (iv) otherwise would be reasonably likely to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect. One-half of any and all HSR filing fees
paid or incurred by either party in connection with the Merger shall be
reimbursed by the other party within five Business Days of payment
thereof.   (c) Each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing
of any pending or, to the Knowledge of such party, threatened action,

until such time as, in Parent\'s sole discretion, an orderly transition can
be accomplished to employee benefit plans and programs maintained by Parent

Affiliates\' employees. The employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans of Parent (or
FNIS, if its initial public offering has occurred) on terms and conditions no
less favorable in the aggregate than those offered to similarly situated
employees of Parent (or FNIS, if its initial public offering has occurred).
Parent (or FNIS, if its initial public offering has occurred) will cause such
employee benefit plans to take into account, for purposes of eligibility and
vesting, and, with respect to vacation benefits, benefit accrual thereunder,
services by employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as if such
services were with Parent (or FNIS) to the same extent that such service was
credited under a comparable plan of the Company; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not require the Parent (or FNIS, if its initial public
offering has occurred) or any Parent Affiliate to amend any of its employee
benefit plans to recognize service performed in years or other periods to the
extent service during such years or other periods is not recognized generally
under the plan with respect to other plan participants. Any restriction on
coverage for pre-existing conditions under the employee benefit plans of
Parent (or FNIS, if applicable) shall be waived (except to the extent the
Company or any Company Subsidiary employee was subject to a pre-
existing condition restriction under the employee benefit plan of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time), and
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall receive credit under the
employee benefit plans of Parent (or FNIS, if applicable) for co-payments and
payments under a deductible limit made by them and for out-of-pocket maximums
applicable to them during the applicable plan year of the Company Benefit
Plan in accordance with the corresponding employee benefit plans of Parent
(or FNIS, if applicable). Each of Parent and FNIS shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor all compensation and employee benefit plan
obligations under the Company Benefit Plans and all employment or severance
agreements entered into by the Company or adopted by the board of directors
of the Company, subject to Parent\'s, FNIS\' or the Surviving Corporation\'s
right to terminate such Company Benefit Plan or employment or severance
agreement pursuant to the terms thereof.   SECTION 7.17 No Obligation to
Employ. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall prevent Parent, the
Company, FNIS, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan, arrangement or agreement, nor shall
anything in this Agreement require any such Person to employ or continue to
employ any employee for any period of time following the Effective Time or

Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent, the Parent Common
Shares or the Parent Stock Options, the Parent Board, or an appropriate
committee of the non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt resolutions
prior to the consummation of the Merger providing that the receipt by the
Company Insiders of the Parent Common Shares upon conversion of the Company
Common Stock, and of options for Parent Common Shares upon conversion of the
Company Stock Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in Section
16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section

Section 16(b) exemption, including, but not limited to, specifying the name
of the Company Insiders, the number of securities to be acquired or disposed
of for each such Person, the material terms of any derivative securities, and
that the approval is intended to make the receipt of such securities exempt
pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d). "SECTION 16 INFORMATION" shall mean information
regarding the Company Insiders, the number of shares of the Company Common
Stock held by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for
Parent Common Shares in connection with the Merger, and the number and
