<PAGE>

          3.1. Purchase Price.

          (a) The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") to be paid by
the Buyer for the Purchased Securities shall be an amount equal to Seven Hundred
Forty Five Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($745,600,000), as adjusted by
the Closing Date Adjustment Amount, which Purchase Price shall be paid in cash
or reserved by the Buyer at the Closing in accordance with Section 3.1(b).

          (b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 3.2, at the Closing,
the Purchase Price shall be paid, and shall be subject to adjustment, as
follows:

               (i) the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers an aggregate amount equal
     to $745,600,000, less the sum of (i) the Estimated Closing Date Adjustment
     Amount, (ii) the Holdback Amount, (iii) the Reserved Amount (as defined
     below), (iv) the Aggregate Option Consideration and (v) the Bonus Amount,
     which shall be paid by the Company at the Closing to such employees of the
     Company and its Subsidiaries, in such amounts, as is set forth in Section
     13.2(g), by wire transfer of immediately available funds at the Closing to
     accounts respectively designated in writing by the Sellers (or by check, to
     any Seller who fails to specify wire transfer instructions to its account),
     with each Seller receiving an amount at Closing equal to the Per Share
     Purchase Price, less the Per Share Holdback Amount, multiplied by the
     number of shares of Company Common Stock set forth opposite such Seller's
     name on Schedule I attached hereto;

               (ii) an amount (the "Holdback Amount") equal to the amount set
     forth on Exhibit G shall be retained by the Buyer from the Purchase Price
     to satisfy any claims by the Buyer Parties pursuant to Section 13.5, and
     shall be administered and distributed, as set forth in and subject to the
     conditions of Section 13.5;

               (iii) an amount equal to the Aggregate Option Consideration shall
     be paid to Option holders pursuant to Section 3.5 and to employees of the
     Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 13.2(g); and

               (iv) an amount equal to the Bonus Amount shall be paid to
     employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 13.2(g).

          3.2. Purchase Price Adjustment.

          (a) Not more than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date (as defined
below), the Buyer may (but shall not be obligated to) prepare from the books and
records of the Company and deliver to the Principal Sellers a written statement
setting forth in reasonable detail the Buyer's calculation of the actual Closing
Date Adjustment Amount (the "Proposed Final Closing Adjustment Amount"). If the
Buyer fails to timely deliver such statement to the Principal Sellers for any
reason, the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be the Final
Closing Adjustment Amount (as defined below) for all purposes under this
Agreement, and shall be conclusive, final and binding upon the Buyer and the
Sellers and shall not be subject to any challenge or appeal by any such parties.



                                      -13-
<PAGE>

          (b) The Majority Sellers shall notify the Buyer in writing of the
Majority Sellers' disagreement (if any) with the amount of the Proposed Final
Closing Adjustment Amount within forty five (45) days after the Principal
Sellers' receipt of the statement described in Section 3.2(a). During such
period, the Majority Sellers and their accountants and other representatives
shall have reasonable access (upon reasonable prior notice) to the books,
records, appropriate personnel, schedules, work papers and other documents of
the Company reasonably necessary to review the statement described in Section
3.2(a) and the calculation of the Proposed Final Closing Adjustment Amount and
the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their
respective appropriate employees), to reasonably cooperate with the Majority
Sellers and their representatives in connection with such review. If the
Majority Sellers fail to timely deliver such notice to the Buyer for any reason,
the Proposed Final Closing Adjustment Amount, as reflected in such statement,
shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Adjustment Amount for all purposes under
this Agreement, and shall be conclusive, final and binding upon the Buyer and
the Sellers and shall not be subject to any challenge or appeal by any such
parties. If the Majority Sellers timely give the Buyer notice of their
disagreement (a "Closing Adjustment Dispute") with the amount of the Proposed
Final Closing Adjustment Amount reflected in such statement, the Buyer and such
Majority Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such Closing
Adjustment Dispute. In the event that the Buyer and such Majority Sellers
resolve such Closing Adjustment Dispute and agree upon the amount of the Final
Closing Adjustment Amount, such agreed Final Closing Adjustment Amount shall be
deemed to be the Final Closing Adjustment Amount for all purposes under this
Agreement, and shall be conclusive, final and binding upon the Buyer and the
Sellers and shall not be subject to any challenge or appeal by any such parties.
In the event that such Closing Adjustment Dispute is not resolved within twenty
(20) Business Days after the Buyer's receipt of such Majority Sellers notice of
such Closing Adjustment Dispute, then such Majority Sellers and the Buyer shall
promptly submit such Closing Adjustment Dispute for resolution to the New York
office of an independent registered public accounting firm of recognized
national standing, mutually acceptable to such Majority Sellers and the Buyer
(the "Resolving Accountant"), for review and resolution of any and all
unresolved matters that are the subject of such Closing Adjustment Dispute.

          (c) Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Buyer and such Majority
Sellers, the Resolving Accountant shall render its decision as to the Closing
Adjustment Dispute within thirty (30) days after it is referred to the Resolving
Accountant. The Resolving Accountant's function shall be to resolve only such
unresolved matters that are the subject of the Closing Adjustment Dispute in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The decision of the
Resolving Accountant shall be conclusive, final and binding upon the Buyer and
the Sellers and shall not be subject to any challenge or appeal by any such
parties; provided, however, that in no event shall any decision of the Resolving
Accountant require (i) the Buyer to be responsible for the payment to the
Sellers of any amount in excess of the amount of the Final Closing Adjustment
proposed by the Majority Sellers and submitted to the Resolving Accountant
pursuant to such Closing Adjustment Dispute or (ii) the Sellers to be
responsible for the payment to the Buyer of any amount in excess of the amount
of the Final Closing Adjustment proposed by the Buyer and submitted to the
Resolving Accountant pursuant to such Closing Adjustment Dispute. The fees of
the Resolving Accountant shall be shared equally among the Buyer, on one hand,
and such Majority Sellers, on the other hand (it being understood that if any
such fees are


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

not timely so paid by such Majority Sellers, the Buyer may pay any such fees and
collect the amount of such payment from the Holdback Amount).

          (d) If the actual amount of the Closing Date Adjustment Amount, as
finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.2 (the "Final Closing
Adjustment Amount"), (i) is less than the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount by
an amount in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted upward by an amount equal to the entire amount of such
deficiency, or (ii) is greater than the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount by
an amount in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the entire amount of such
excess. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Post-Closing Adjustment" shall mean
any upward adjustment to the Purchase Price in respect of any decrease of the
Final Closing Adjustment Amount, or any downward adjustment to the Purchase
Price in respect of any increase of the Final Closing Adjustment Amount, in
either case pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.2.

          (e) Subject to any applicable limitations set forth in Section 12, in
the event of: (i) a downward Post-Closing Adjustment, within five (5) Business
Days after the final determination thereof in accordance with this Section 3.2,
the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers (in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests on the date of such payment) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to accounts respectively designated in writing by
the Sellers (or by check, to any Seller who fails to specify wire transfer
instructions to its account), an amount equal to such downward Post-Closing
Adjustment, or (ii) an upward Post-Closing Adjustment, at any time after the
final determination thereof in accordance with this Section 3.2, the Buyer may
collect an amount equal to such upward Post-Closing Adjustment from the Holdback
Amount.

          3.3. Reserved Amount.

          In the event that any Securityholder (each, a "Defaulting
Securityholder") fails for any reason to deliver its shares (the "Defaulted
Shares") of Company Common Stock at the Closing, the Buyer shall have the right
to retain from the Purchase Price an amount (the "Reserved Amount") equal to the
amount of the Per Share Purchase Price, multiplied by the number of such
Defaulted Shares. The Reserved Amount shall be retained by, and available to,
the Buyer for the purpose of acquiring such Defaulted Shares from and after the
Closing Date pursuant to Section 13.3 or Section 13.4. Promptly after the
consummation of the purchase by the Buyer of any outstanding Defaulted Shares,
the Reserved Amount with respect to such Defaulted Shares shall be paid by the
Buyer to such Defaulting Securityholder by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to accounts respectively designated in writing by the Defaulting
Securityholders (or by check, to any Defaulting Securityholder who fails to
specify wire transfer instructions to its account). For the avoidance of doubt,
no interest shall be paid or payable to the Sellers or any other Person in
respect of the Reserved Amount.

          3.4. Withholding Rights.

          The Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such Taxes as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under all applicable


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

Law, provided that (i) the Buyer and the Company shall deliver to the Principal
Sellers, no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a
schedule of all amounts so required to be withheld and (ii) the Buyer, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall pay all such Taxes withheld to the
appropriate Governmental Entity promptly after such amount being withheld (but
in no event later than when such payment is due). To the extent that Taxes are
so withheld by the Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person who would have received such payment in accordance with the terms hereof
if no amount had been withheld.

          3.5. Stock Options.

          (a) At the Closing, each Option (other than the Management Options,
which shall be treated in accordance with Section 3.5(b)) representing the right
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, Coleman Common Stock or Sunbeam
Common Stock (collectively, "Stock") which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Closing under the Company Stock Option Plan, the Coleman Stock Option Plan
or the Sunbeam Stock Option Plan (whether or not then vested or exercisable)
shall be cancelled at the Closing in exchange for a payment at the Closing in
cash to the holder of such Option in such amount as is set forth opposite such
holder's name (in a column designating the amount of such cash payment) on a
schedule, to be delivered by the Principal Sellers to the Buyer two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Schedule of Option Payments") which amount
shall be calculated in accordance with Section 3.5(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule.

          (b) At the Closing, fifty percent (50%) of the Options held by each
individual listed in Section 3.5(b) of the Disclosure Schedule (such fifty
percent (50%) of such Options, the "Management Options") shall be converted into
such number of restricted shares of Buyer Common Stock as is equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (i) the aggregate value of such Management Options
held by such individual as set forth opposite such individual's name (in a
column designating the amount of such value to be paid in restricted Buyer
Common Stock) on the Schedule of Option Payments, by (ii) the Fair Market Value
of the Buyer Common Stock; provided, that such shares of restricted Buyer Common
Stock shall be subject to the terms of the Buyer's 2003 Stock Incentive Plan and
a Restricted Stock Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit H (the "Restricted Stock Agreement").

SECTION 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING SELLERS

or acknowledgement, in and of itself or solely by virtue of the inclusion of
such information in such Seller Disclosure Schedule, that such information is
required to be set forth therein or that such information is material to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the Sellers or the Business. Capitalized terms used
and not otherwise defined in any Seller Disclosure Schedule shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to them in this Agreement. As a material inducement
to the Buyer to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement each
Seller, except as specifically set forth in its Seller Disclosure Schedule, with
respect to itself and not any other Seller, individually and not jointly, hereby

          4.3. No Conflicts.

          (a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Seller Closing Documents to which such Seller is a party do not and will not

conflict with (as applicable) the articles or certificate of incorporation,
bylaws, articles or certificate of formation or organization, limited liability
company or operating agreement, partnership agreement or other organizational
document of such Seller if such Seller is not an individual, in each case, as
currently in effect; (ii) violate or conflict with any Law binding upon such
Seller or violate or result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any
material agreement to which such Seller is a party or by which the Seller or any
of its assets are otherwise bound, except, in each case, for such violations,
conflicts, breaches or defaults as would not reasonably be expected to result in
a material adverse effect upon the ability of such Seller to enter into or
perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Seller Closing Document to
which such Seller is a party; or (iii) result in, or require the creation or
imposition of any Encumbrance upon or with respect to any of the Purchased
Securities held by such Seller. Except for filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino

Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for such consents,
authorizations, waivers or filings as to which the failure to obtain would not

of such Seller to enter into or perform its obligations under this Agreement or
any Seller Closing Document to which such Seller is a party.

          (b) There are no Proceedings pending against such Seller or, to the
knowledge of such Seller, pending against the Company or threatened against such
Seller or the Company that challenge the validity of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or which, if adversely determined, would
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect upon the ability
of the Seller to enter into or perform its obligations under this Agreement or
any Seller Closing Documents to which such Seller is a party.

          4.4. Ownership of the Purchased Securities.

          Subject to the terms of the Securityholders' Agreement, such Seller

of the Purchased Securities set forth opposite its name on Schedule I attached
hereto, beneficially and of record, free and clear of any Encumbrance (except
for restrictions imposed generally by applicable securities laws). Except for
the Securityholders' Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, there are
no shareholder or other agreements affecting the right of such Seller to convey
such Purchased Securities (or rights therein) to the Buyer as contemplated
hereby, and such Seller has the right, authority, power and capacity to sell,
transfer, convey, assign and deliver the Purchased Securities to the Buyer as
contemplated hereby, free and clear of any Encumbrance (except for restrictions
imposed generally by applicable securities laws). Upon delivery to the Buyer of
the certificate or other instruments representing all of the Purchased
Securities set forth opposite such Seller's name on Schedule I attached hereto

Agreement, the Buyer will acquire good and valid title in and to such


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

Purchased Securities, free and clear of any Encumbrance (except for applicable
securities laws restrictions).

          4.5. Litigation.

          There are no Proceedings that have been commenced or, to the knowledge

which such Seller is a party or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

          4.6. Brokers.

any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COMPANY AND ITS
           SUBSIDIARIES

          Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
deliver to the Buyer a Disclosure Schedule with numbered sections corresponding
to the relevant sections in this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"). Each
exception set forth in the Disclosure Schedule and each other response to this
Agreement set forth in the Disclosure Schedule shall be identified by reference
to, or shall be grouped under a heading referring to, a specific section of this
Agreement. Any disclosure made in the Disclosure Schedule that is identified by
reference to, or grouped under a heading referring to, a specific individual
section of this Agreement shall be deemed disclosed in such Disclosure Schedule
and applicable to any other section of the Disclosure Schedule only to the
extent that such disclosure is reasonably apparent from its face to be
applicable to such other section of the Disclosure Schedule. The inclusion of
any information in any Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgement, in and of itself or solely by virtue of the inclusion of such
information in the Disclosure Schedule, that such information is required to be
set forth therein or that such information is material to the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Sellers or the Business or constitutes a Material Adverse
Effect. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in any Disclosure
Schedule shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in this Agreement.
As a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into and perform its obligations
under this Agreement, except as specifically set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, the Company hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer as follows:

          5.1. Organization and Good Standing.

          The Company and each Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, and has all requisite corporate or other power and authority, as
applicable, to conduct its business as presently conducted and to own and lease
the material properties and assets presently used in


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

connection therewith and to perform all of its material obligations under each
material agreement and instrument by which it is bound. The Company and each
Subsidiary is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the nature or character of the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or be in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

          5.2. Power and Authorization.

          The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and under the other
agreements and documents required to be delivered by it at the Closing that are
set forth in Section 10.3 (collectively, the "Company Closing Documents"). The
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting the
enforceability of creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles, the
discretion of courts in granting equitable remedies and matters of public
policy. At the Closing, the Company Closing Documents will be duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, when executed and delivered at the Closing as
contemplated herein, each of the Company Closing Documents will constitute the
valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, in each case, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency and similar laws affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights
generally, general equitable principles, the discretion of courts in granting
equitable remedies and matters of public policy.

          5.3. Capitalization.

          (a) As of the date hereof, the total outstanding shares of the
Company's capital stock consist of 31,724,796 shares of Company Common Stock,
all of which shares are owned of record by the Persons, and in the respective
amounts, set forth in Section 5.3(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. Immediately
after the Closing, the shares of Company Common Stock (other than those that are
Purchased Securities acquired by the Buyer at the Closing) will be owned of
record by the Persons, and in the respective amounts, set forth in Section
5.3(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (as the same may be amended immediately prior
to the Closing to reflect transfers of Company Common Stock, to the extent
permitted hereunder, and issuances of Company Common Stock upon exercise of
Convertible Securities). Under the Company Stock Option Plan, there are
authorized Options to purchase 2,296,433 shares of Company Common Stock, of
which, as of the date hereof, there are issued and outstanding Options to
purchase 2,043,899 shares of Company Common Stock. Other than the

(contingent or otherwise), including employee benefit arrangements, relating to
the issuance, conversion, registration, voting, sale, repurchase or transfer of
any equity interests or other securities of the Company or obligating the
Company or any other Person to purchase or redeem any such equity interests or
other securities. All outstanding shares and rights to acquire shares of capital
stock of the Company were issued on and after the Emergence Date. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly


                                      -20-
<PAGE>

authorized, are validly issued and outstanding, are fully paid and nonassessable
and have been issued in compliance in all material respects with applicable
securities Laws. No securities issued by the Company from the Emergence Date to
the date hereof were, and as of the Closing Date will have been, issued in
violation of any statutory or common law preemptive rights. There are no
dividends which have accrued or been declared but are unpaid on any capital
stock of the Company.

          (b) All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock and equity
interests (as applicable) of each Subsidiary are owned (beneficially and of
record) by the Company or another Subsidiary, free and clear of any Encumbrance,
other than directors' qualifying shares, shares held by nominee holders and
similar requirements of applicable Laws. Under the Sunbeam Stock Option Plan and
the Coleman Stock Option Plan, there are authorized Options to purchase 577,438
shares of Sunbeam Common Stock and 866,849 shares of Coleman Common Stock,
respectively, of which, as of the date hereof, there are issued and outstanding

Coleman Common Stock. Under the First Alert/Powermate Equity Plan, there are

license or other agreement granting to any Person any right to the use,

to any current employee or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary,
(ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any of the Plans, (iii)

Environmental Permits that are presently due or pending have been submitted on a

<PAGE>

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto shall diligently assist and cooperate in preparing and filing all
documents required to be submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with
such transactions and in obtaining any consents, waivers, authorizations or
approvals which may be required to be obtained in connection with such
transactions.

          (b) If the Company, any Principal Seller or the Buyer becomes aware of
any Proceeding, including any proceeding by a Governmental Entity or private

parties thereof promptly after becoming so aware of such Challenge. Each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with each other and
use its respective commercially reasonable efforts in order to contest and
resist any Challenge and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (c) The Company shall notify the Buyer in writing promptly (but in no
event more than five (5) Business Days) after the Company has Knowledge of any
actual or asserted violation of or noncompliance with applicable Law by the
Company or any Subsidiary that is (i) material to the operations of the Company
or any Material Division and (ii) not set forth in the Disclosure Schedule.

          (d) The Company shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to, assist and
cooperate with the Buyer as reasonably requested by the Buyer in connection with

Investment Agreements and the Financing Commitment Letter or otherwise for the
Buyer to satisfy its obligations under Section 7.15, including, without
limitation, in connection with the preparation and delivery of any disclosure
schedules and other information, documents, instruments, securities and
materials relating to the Company and/or any Subsidiary (each in such form and
substance) that shall be necessary for the effectuation of such transactions,
and (ii) the preparation and filing by the Buyer of any filings (including any
proxy statement) required to be made by the Buyer with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or pursuant to applicable Law or securities exchange rules
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (e) Prior to Closing, the Company shall consult with, and consider the
views of, the Buyer prior to making any increase in the respective aggregate
amounts reserved with respect to Environmental Damages and Litigation Damages
from the amounts reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet.

a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice,

competition filing or notifications required by any other Governmental Entity
(including under foreign competition Laws) as


                                      -46-
<PAGE>

promptly as practicable. The Company and the Buyer each shall (as applicable):
(a) respond in a commercially reasonable manner and as promptly as practicable
to any formal or informal inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust
Division for additional information or documentary materials, and to all
inquiries and requests received from any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust or competition matters; (b)
take all commercially reasonable steps to seek early termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any similar Laws and to obtain
all required approvals; and (c) refrain from entering into any agreement with
the FTC or the Antitrust Division or any Governmental Entity not to consummate
or delay consummation of or to give notice of consummation, other than as
required by Law, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with
the prior written consent of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company and the
Majority Sellers, on the other hand (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Each party hereto shall promptly notify each other party
hereto of any written or oral communication to that party from the FTC, the
Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity
and shall permit the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company and the Majority
Sellers, on the other hand, or their respective counsel to review in advance any
proposed written communication or response to any of the foregoing; provided,
however, that no party hereto shall be required to disclose to any other party
hereto or its counsel any information that such disclosing party deems to be
competitively or commercially sensitive thereto. In connection with the receipt
of any necessary approvals under the HSR Act and any foreign competition Laws,
the Buyer shall propose, negotiate and cooperate with the Company and the
Majority Sellers to effect prior to the Closing Date, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets
or businesses of the Buyer and its subsidiaries or the Company and the
Subsidiaries (in either case in an amount not to exceed, in the aggregate, the
value of 5% of the aggregate assets of the Business), or otherwise take any
action that reasonably limits the freedom of action with respect to any of the
businesses, product lines, or assets of any of the Buyer, the Buyer's
subsidiaries, the Company or the Subsidiaries, as may be required in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order, or other order in any Proceedings, which would otherwise have
the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

          7.6. No Solicitation.

          (a) Neither any Seller, the Company nor any Subsidiary shall, and each
of the foregoing shall not allow any Person acting on its behalf to, directly or
indirectly, continue, initiate or participate in discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any nonpublic information to, any Person (other than the Buyer
and its representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) concerning any sale of a material portion of the assets used in the
operations of the Business (other than in the ordinary course of its business
and consistent with past practice or in accordance with Section 7.2) or any
securities of the Company (including, without limitation, the Purchased
Securities) or any Subsidiary (other than issuances of shares of Common Stock,
Sunbeam Common Stock, Coleman Common Stock, First Alert/Powermate Common Stock
upon exercise of Options or First Alert/Powermate Options in accordance with

          (b) Each Seller and the Company shall, and the Company shall cause
each Subsidiary to, promptly communicate to the Buyer the terms of any proposal
that it may receive after the date of this Agreement in respect of an
Acquisition Transaction. Any notification under this Section 7.6 shall include
the identity of each Person making such proposal, the terms of such proposal and
any other information with respect thereto as the Buyer may request.

          (c) The Company and each Seller hereby agree that a monetary remedy
for a breach of the agreements set forth in this Section 7.6 will be inadequate
and impracticable, and that any such breach would cause the Buyer and its
Affiliates irreparable harm. In the event of a breach of this Section 7.6, in
addition to any other remedies available to the Buyer, prior to the Closing, the
Buyer shall be entitled to seek equitable remedies in a court of competent
jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the equitable remedy of specific
performance with respect to the transactions set forth in this Agreement, and
shall be entitled to such injunctive relief, including temporary restraining
orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, as a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine. If the Closing shall occur, the Buyer
shall not be entitled to any remedy for any breaches of this Section 7.6 that
may have occurred; provided, however, that all expenses incurred by the Buyer to
enforce the Sellers' obligations contained in this Section 7.6 shall be deemed
Pre-Closing Company Expenses, and shall be subject to the provisions of this
Agreement applicable to the Pre-Closing Company Expenses.

          7.7. Interest in Purchased Securities.

          From and after the date hereof until the termination of this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall
not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, no Seller shall in any manner sell,
assign, convey, transfer, lease, pledge, mortgage or dispose of, or otherwise
take any action that may result in the incurrence or suffering of any
Encumbrance on or relating to, any Purchased Securities or Convertible
Securities (including any shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise or conversion thereof), other than transfers to the Company in
connection with the exercise, conversion or cancellation of Convertible
Securities.

          7.8. Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount.

          Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to the Buyer a good faith estimate of the Closing Date
Adjustment Amount (the "Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount"). The Buyer may
seek to adjust the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 3.2, and any such adjustment and corresponding
adjustment, if any, to the Purchase Price will be governed by such procedures

The full premium for such six-year period for such insurance (the "D&O Premium")
shall be paid in full by the Company at or prior to the Closing and shall be

The limits of such tail policy shall be independent of any other limits of

          (b) Effective as of the Closing and until the sixth anniversary of the

Person or any arbitration or administrative or other proceeding relating to the
Business, the Company or its Subsidiaries or the status of such individual as a
director or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary at or prior to the Closing,
to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable Law; and (ii) retain or
include in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company and the

expenses, in each case to the extent in effect immediately prior to the Closing,
for the benefit of (as applicable) the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
directors, officers, employees and agents, and shall not thereafter amend the
same (except to the extent that such amendment preserves, increases or broadens
the indemnification or other rights theretofore available to such directors,
officers, employees and agents). If the Buyer and/or Company merges into,
consolidates with or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another
Person, then and in each such case, the Buyer shall, and/or shall cause the
Company to, make proper provision so that the surviving or resulting corporation
or the transferee in such transaction shall assume the obligations under this
Section 7.13. The obligations set forth in this Section 7.13 shall continue for
a period of six (6) years following the Closing and shall continue in effect
thereafter with respect to any action, suit or proceeding commenced prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, and is intended to benefit (as
applicable) each director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any
Subsidiary who has held such capacity on or prior to the Closing Date and is
either a party to an indemnification agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or now or hereafter is entitled to indemnification or advancement

incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the comparable organizational
documents of any of the Subsidiaries as of the date hereof.

accountants to the Company to audit the Company's consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2004 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity and cash flows at and for the fiscal year ending December
31, 2004, including in each case notes thereto, of the type that would be
required to be included with such statements to satisfy the requirements of
Regulation S-X promulgated by Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the agreement pursuant to
which such engagement is effected to provide for such audit to be completed on
or before February 28, 2005, which provision shall not


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

be amended or modified to provide for any later date for such completion without
the prior written consent of the Buyer.

          7.15. Financing.

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Buyer shall

shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the Bank Consents
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, and if such Bank
Consents are not so obtained within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date
hereof, the Buyer shall continue to use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Bank Consents as promptly as practicable thereafter. No amendments
to or modifications, terminations or cancellations of the terms and conditions
of the Financing Commitment Letter or the Equity Investment Agreements (except
for any amendment or modification that would not be reasonably expected to
affect the certainty of Closing or materially delay the consummation of the
Closing) shall be made by the Buyer without the prior written consent of the
Majority Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The Buyer shall not deliver any written instructions to the Equity Escrow Agent
pursuant to the Equity Escrow Agreement instructing the Equity Escrow Agent to
release the funds deposited into escrow under the Equity Escrow Agreement, other
than in connection with Closing or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof, without the prior written consent of the
Majority Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The Buyer shall promptly notify the Company and the Principal Sellers in writing
of any fact or occurrence of which the Buyer becomes aware that would reasonably
be expected to cause any conditions to the financing provided for by the
Financing Commitment Letter or the Equity Investment Agreements not to be
satisfied. In the event that any or all of the borrowings or amounts provided
pursuant to the Equity Investment Agreements or to be provided pursuant to the
Financing Commitment Letter are unavailable for any reason in amounts sufficient
to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
payment of the Purchase Price on the terms contemplated hereby, the Buyer shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and the Company and the
Principal Sellers shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Buyer in obtaining, replacement financing from alternative sources on
terms and conditions that are commercially reasonable (it being understood and
agreed, however, that none of the Sellers shall have any obligation to offer to
provide all or any portion of such financing).

          7.16. Public Statements.

          Except for the joint press release attached hereto as Exhibit J, which
is being issued by the parties as of the date hereof, and except as required by
applicable Law or securities exchange rules, in which event the parties shall
consult with each other in advance, prior to the Closing Date, no press release
or other public announcement (if materially different than those previously
made) relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
issued, made or permitted to be issued or made by any party to this Agreement or
its representatives without prior consultation among the Buyer and the Company.

number of shares of authorized capital stock of each class or series of its
capital stock, (b) the number of issued and outstanding shares of each class or
series of its capital stock and (c) the number of shares of its capital stock
held in treasury; and (b) if such Subsidiary is not a corporation, (i) the
amount of each class or series of its authorized equity interests and (i) the
amount of issued and outstanding interest of each class or series of its equity
interests.

Company shall deliver to the Buyer a certificate (the "Adjusted EBITDA
Certificate"), executed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company,

ending on December 31, 2004. Without limiting the generality of the provisions
of Section 7.3, the Company shall make available to the Buyer and its
representatives access to the work papers used by the Company to prepare the
Adjusted EBITDA Certificate and to such other books, records and information as
the Buyer may reasonably request for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of

          (a) by the Buyer or the Principal Sellers, if (i) the Closing has not
occurred by March 15, 2005 or such other date agreed upon by the Buyer and the

or ruling or taken any other final action restraining, enjoining or otherwise

                                      -57-
<PAGE>

party; provided, however, that if such termination results from (a) the
deliberate failure of any party to fulfill a condition of performance of the
obligations of the other party under this Agreement, (b) the failure of any
party to perform a material covenant under this Agreement, or (c) the material
breach by any party of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, and, at the time of termination, the terminating party was not in
breach of its obligations under this Agreement such that the non-terminating

any of the Buyer Parties resulting from or arising out of or in connection with
any breach of any representation or warranty made by such Seller in Section 4.4.

          (b) Subject to all applicable terms, conditions and limitations set
forth in this Section 12.2 and Section 13.5, each Seller shall severally, but
not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Parties from and against such
Seller's Proportionate Interest of the amount of any Loss or Losses (each, a
"Several Loss") sustained or required to be paid by any of the Buyer Parties
resulting from or arising out of or in connection with any breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Company in Section 5.3 of this Agreement.

          (c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, each Seller's
aggregate liability for: (i) any Individual Losses arising under Section 12.2(a)
shall not exceed an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount of
such Individual Losses attributable to such Seller and (B) such Seller's Pro
Rata Share; and (ii) any Several Losses arising under Section 12.2(b) shall not
exceed an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (x) such Seller's
Proportionate Interest of such Several Losses and (y) such Seller's Pro Rata
Share; provided,


                                      -58-
<PAGE>

however, that in no event shall the aggregate liability of any Seller for all
Individual Losses and Several Losses exceed an amount equal to such Seller's Pro
Rata Share.

          (d) If any Seller makes any payment under this Section 12.2 in respect
of any Losses, such Seller shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment,
to the rights of the indemnified party against any third party with respect to
such Losses.

          (e) All payments made by any Seller pursuant to this Section 12.2 in
respect of the indemnification of any Buyer Party hereunder shall be paid by
such Seller to the Buyer (for the benefit of each relevant Buyer Party). All
payments pursuant to this Section 12.2 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

SECTION 13. CERTAIN ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

          13.1. Tax Matters.

          (a) The Company shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company or
any Subsidiary consistent with past practices for taxable periods commencing

the Company to pay the Taxes shown to be due thereon. The Company shall provide
to the Buyer a copy of each material Tax Return that is required to be filed

faith whether to accept all comments made by Buyer with respect to such Tax
Returns.

          (b) All of the parties hereto agree to treat for Tax purposes as
occurring at the beginning of the day immediately following the Closing Date in
accordance with Treasury Regulation (ss). 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (i) the

and second sentences of Section 13.2(f).

          (c) The following payments made on the Closing Date shall be deemed to

Subsidiaries, to the extent paid on the Closing Date pursuant to the Company's
normal payroll practice, (ii) second, any and all payments made pursuant to

use, or other similar Taxes, duties, excise, governmental charges or fees
("Transfer Taxes") imposed as a result of the sale of the Purchased Securities
to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne by the Seller whose sale
gave rise to such Transfer Taxes. Where the Buyer is required by


                                      -59-
<PAGE>

Law to remit such Transfer Taxes to a Governmental Entity, each appropriate
Seller shall remit its share of the Transfer Taxes to the Buyer ten (10) days

Buyer, to the extent required by Applicable Law, shall prepare and file all Tax
Returns on a timely basis relating to any such Transfer Taxes.

          (e) All Tax allocation, indemnity, sharing or similar agreements or
arrangements (whether or not written) with respect to or involving the Companies
or any Subsidiary (other than those that are solely among the Company and/or
Subsidiaries that are wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company)
shall be terminated as of immediately prior to the Closing, and after the
Closing, neither the Companies nor any Subsidiary shall be bound thereby or have
any liability thereunder, and such agreements or arrangements shall have no
further effect for any Tax year (whether the current year, a future year or a
past year).

          13.2. Employee Benefits Matters.

          (a) From and after the Closing and until December 31, 2005, the Buyer
shall provide compensation to the continuing employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and employee benefits to the employees and former employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (such employees and former employees, "Employee
Beneficiaries") that are no less favorable in the aggregate per employee than
those provided to such individuals immediately prior to the Closing Date, taking
into account the provisions of Section 13.2(f). From and after the Closing, with
respect to any employee benefits that are provided to Employee Beneficiaries
under the Buyer's employee benefits plans, the Buyer shall cause service by
Employee Beneficiaries with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors to be taken into account for purposes of eligibility to
participate, eligibility to commence benefits, credit for years of service and,
solely for purposes of vacation and severance benefits, benefit accruals (except
to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative accrual of benefits for
the same period of service) under the benefit plans of the Buyer in which such
employees participate.

          (b) From and after the Closing, with respect to any welfare benefits
that are provided to Employee Beneficiaries under the Buyer's employee benefits
plans, the Buyer shall cause to be (i) waived any pre-existing condition
limitations and (ii) credited any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such employees and their beneficiaries and dependents during the
portion of the calendar year in which participation commences prior to
participation in the benefit plans provided by the Buyer.

          (c) The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, honor each Plan
and arrangement set forth in Section 13.2(c) of the Disclosure Schedule in
accordance with its respective terms; provided, however, that for such period
following the Closing Date as is set forth in Section 13.2(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule, the Buyer shall not terminate any such Plan or arrangement or make any
amendment to such Plan or arrangement that would adversely affect the rights of
participants or beneficiaries thereunder (except to the extent required by
changes in applicable Law).

          (d) With respect to (i) each individual set forth on Section 13.2(d)
of the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company on the date hereof and (ii)
each additional individual that the Buyer notifies the Company in writing not
less than five (5) Business Days


                                      -60-
<PAGE>

prior to the Closing Date whose employment with the Company or any Subsidiary
shall terminate effective as of immediately following the Closing (collectively,
the "Listed Individuals"), the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to,
immediately upon such termination make payments and provide benefits to each of
the Listed Individuals in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 13.2(d)
of the Disclosure Schedule.

          (e) The Buyer shall honor, and shall cause the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries to honor, all earned but unused vacation and other time-off accrued
by the Employee Beneficiaries prior to the Closing in accordance with the
applicable policies in effect with respect to the Employee Beneficiaries as of
the date hereof.

          (f) The Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay any earned but
unpaid annual bonus award under the Company Management Incentive Bonus Plan in
respect of fiscal year 2004 determined under the terms of such plan within five
(5) Business Days following the Closing Date (to the extent not previously
paid), to each of the Listed Individuals and each employee of the Company as of
December 31, 2004 subject to an award thereunder (collectively, the "MIP
Specified Employees"), and to each employee of Coleman and Sunbeam and their
respective Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 subject to an award thereunder.
The Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay any earned but unpaid
long-term incentive compensation award under the Company's Key Executive
Long-Term Incentive Plan in respect of the performance cycle ended in fiscal
year 2004 determined under the terms of such plan, but assuming in all cases
participation and continued employment for the entirety of such performance
cycle, within five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date (to the extent
not previously paid), to each of the Listed Individuals and each employee of the
Company subject to an award thereunder (collectively, the "LTIP Specified
Employees") and to each employee of Coleman and Sunbeam and their respective
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 subject to an award thereunder. With
respect to each uncompleted performance cycle under the Company's Key Executive
Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay
(i) to each of the LTIP Specified Employees, within five (5) Business Days
following the Closing Date, the aggregate value of his or her outstanding
long-term incentive compensation award with respect to such uncompleted
performance cycle, based on actual performance for any completed periods and
target level performance for the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years for such performance
cycles, assuming participation and continued employment for the entirety of each
such uncompleted performance cycle (the "Uncompleted Performance Cycle
Payments") and (ii) to all participating employees of Coleman and Sunbeam and
their Subsidiaries, the aggregate value of all long-term incentive compensation
awards determined under the terms of such plan with respect to the 2005 and 2006
fiscal years, based on actual performance for the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years,
when and if such amounts become due and payable thereunder. The Sellers shall
set forth on Section 13.2(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, the projected
Uncompleted Performance Cycle Payment to each of the LTIP Specified Employees.
The aggregate Uncompleted Performance Cycle Payments shall not be (x) less than
the aggregate projected amounts in Section 13.2(f) of the Disclosure Schedule or
(y) more than the aggregate projected amounts in Section 13.2(f) of the
Disclosure Schedule by more than $500,000. Prior to the Closing, the Board
shall, in its sole discretion, make any and all determinations necessary to
determine achievement of business objectives and performance factors (A) under
the Company Management Incentive Bonus Plan with respect to the 2004 fiscal year
and (B) under the Company's Key Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan in respect to
all individuals described


                                      -61-
<PAGE>

above pursuant to this Section 13.2(f). The Board shall make such determinations
consistent with the past practice of the Board in making similar determinations
in one or both of the last two (2) fiscal years provided, however, that the
Board may also make adjustments, if any, based on changes in vacation policies,
insurance settlements and recoveries, restructuring activities, changes in the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' retiree medical plans and warranty, bad debt,
product liability and other judgmental reserves. No later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer for its review a
schedule of the Uncompleted Performance Cycle Payment to be paid to each of the
LTIP Specified Employees and a schedule of the achievement of business
objectives and performance factors including any adjustments approved in
determining such achievement.

          (g) On the Closing Date and immediately following the payment of the
Purchase Price by Buyer, the Company shall, and the Buyer shall cause the
Company to, (i) make a payment (collectively, the "Bonus Amount") in the
aggregate amount set forth on Section 13.2(g) of the Disclosure Schedule to such
individuals, and in such amounts, in accordance with the terms set forth in such
schedule (in each case, less any applicable withholding Taxes on such amounts),
(ii) make a payment (the "Unallocated Option Payment") in an aggregate amount
equal to the excess of the Aggregate Option Consideration over the aggregate
amount of payments made pursuant to Section 3.5 to holders of outstanding
Options, as follows: (A) subject to clause (B) below, payment of the Unallocated
Option Payment shall be made to such individuals and in such amounts in
accordance with the terms set forth in Section 13.2(g) of the Disclosure
Schedule and (B) a portion of the Unallocated Option Payment equal to Two
Million Dollars ($2,000,000) shall be used to pay the Company's half of the
Retention Payments described in (iii) below, and (iii) make a payment in an
aggregate amount equal to Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) (the "Retention
Payments") to such individuals and in such amounts in accordance with the terms
set forth in Section 13.2(g) of the Disclosure Schedule.

          (h) Following the Closing Date, the Board shall, and the Buyer and the
Company shall cause the Board to, honor all outstanding awards under the Company
Management Incentive Plan and the Company's Key Executive Long Term Incentive
Plan (other than with respect to the MIP Specified Employees and the LTIP
Specified Employees, as applicable), in accordance with the terms of such plans.

          13.3. Merger Following the Closing.

          No later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause to become
effective a merger of the Company with a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer
(the "Merger"), with the Company as the surviving corporation, pursuant to which
each outstanding Defaulted Share shall be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive from the Buyer the Per Share Purchase Price. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the effective time of the Merger, subject to the receipt
by the Company from each holder of Defaulted Shares of a Letter of Transmittal
and share certificates representing such Defaulted Shares, the Buyer shall pay
to such holder (by check) with respect to each such Defaulted Share an amount
equal to (a) the Per Share Purchase Price, less the Per Share Holdback Amount,
multiplied by (b) the number of Defaulted Shares held by such holder. Upon the
effectiveness of the Merger: (a) such Defaulted Shares shall be deemed Purchased


                                      -62-
<PAGE>

Securities for all purposes hereunder; (b) such holder shall be deemed a Seller
for all purposes under this Agreement, and as such shall, without limitation, be
subject to the Sellers' rights and obligations hereunder, as though each such
holder had been a Seller as of the Closing Date; and (c) Schedule I attached
hereto shall be amended to reflect the foregoing.

          13.4. Joinder.

          From the date hereof through the date of consummation of the Merger,
in connection with the purchase by the Buyer of any shares of Company Common
Stock, including any Defaulted Shares (pursuant to Section 3.7 of the
Securityholders' Agreement or otherwise), any Securityholder not executing this
Agreement on the date hereof (each, a "Joining Securityholder") holding such
Company Common Stock shall be requested to execute and deliver to the Buyer a
Joinder Agreement. Upon such execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement by
such Joining Securityholder, and the delivery by such Joining Securityholder to
the Buyer of certificates representing such shares of Company Common Stock
(together with stock powers in respect thereof, duly executed in blank) against
the payment by the Buyer to such Joining Securityholder of the Per Share
Purchase Price (less the Per Share Holdback Amount) in respect of each such
share of Company Common Stock, as provided in Section 3.1(b):

          (a) such Company Common Stock held by such Joining Securityholder
shall be deemed Purchased Securities for all purposes hereunder;

          (b) such Joining Securityholder shall be deemed a Seller for all
purposes under this Agreement, and as such shall, without limitation, be subject
to the Sellers' rights and obligations hereunder, as though each such Joining
Securityholder had been a Seller as of the date hereof; and

          (c) Schedule I attached hereto shall be appropriately amended to
reflect such Joining Securityholder as a Seller hereunder and the Company Common
Stock held by such Joining Securityholder as Purchased Securities hereunder.

          13.5. Holdback Amount.

          (a) The Holdback Amount shall be withheld by the Buyer from the
Purchase Price (as provided herein) and, subject to the applicable terms of this
Agreement, shall be available to satisfy any claims made by the Buyer Parties
pursuant to Sections 12.2(b) and this Section 13.5.

          (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.2, the Holdback Amount
shall provide the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of the Buyer Parties
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 13.5(b), and the Holdback Amount shall be
a cap and limit on the Sellers' obligations under this Agreement relating to or
arising under this Agreement, and the Sellers shall not be liable for any
obligations relating to or arising under this Agreement in excess of the
Holdback Amount, including, without limitation, with respect to any
misrepresentation, breach or default of or under any of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement; provided,
however, that nothing set forth herein shall be deemed to limit any party's


                                      -63-
<PAGE>

rights or remedies in the event that the other party has committed fraud. The
Buyer shall be entitled to any and all interest or other income accruing or
earned on the Holdback Amount.

          (c) Subject to the applicable terms, conditions and limitations of
this Section 13.5, the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to collect amounts from
the Holdback Amount from time to time to satisfy claims for any Company
Liabilities sustained or required to be paid by any Buyer Party, and the
Holdback Amount shall be reduced by any amounts so collected.

          (d) Any Buyer Party shall be entitled to control, contest and defend
(through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Majority Sellers) any Proceeding
instituted by any third party (any such third-party Proceeding being referred to
as a "Third-Party Claim") in respect of which such Buyer Party may seek to
satisfy a claim pursuant to this Section 13.5; provided that the Buyer Party
shall defend such Third-Party Claim in good faith. So long as the Buyer Party is
conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with this Section
13.5, each of the Principal Sellers shall be entitled, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in, but not control, such contest and defense and be
represented by attorneys of its or their own choosing. In the event that the
Buyer Party elects not to control, contest and defend such Third-Party Claim,
the Majority Sellers may control, contest and defend such Third-Party Claim and
shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Holdback Amount of their reasonable
costs and expenses in connection therewith; provided, however, that the Buyer
Party may assume within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances its
right to control, contest and defend such Third-Party Claim upon providing
written notice thereof to the Majority Sellers. If the Buyer Party assumes the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such claims may
be effected by the Buyer Party without the Majority Sellers' consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless such compromise
or settlement does not involve any monetary damages to which the Holdback Amount
is applied by the Buyer. If the Majority Sellers assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by
the Majority Sellers without the Buyer's consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless (i) there is no finding or admission
of any violation of Law and no material adverse effect on any other claims that
have theretofore been made against a Buyer Party and (ii) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full from the Holdback Amount,
and, in the case of a Third-Party Claim relating to Taxes, such resolution is
not reasonably likely to adversely affect the Buyer Parties in any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in the event of any Third-Party Claim for which the Buyer
Parties are entitled to the satisfaction or payment of any claim under this
Section 13.5, the Buyer may choose to be fully responsible for such Third-Party
Claim, in which case, no Seller shall have any right to control, contest or
defend such Third-Party Claim. Each of the Principal Sellers shall be entitled,
at its own cost and expense, to participate in, but not control, and be
represented by attorneys, advisors and professionals of its or their own
choosing with respect to any matter to which the Buyer Parties are making a
claim that the Holdback Amount applies. In connection with any such claim, the
Buyer shall promptly provide copies to the Principal Sellers of all material
notices, pleadings, filings, correspondence and other submissions and reports
and shall give each of the Principal Sellers a reasonable opportunity (at such
Principal Seller's own expense) to comment in advance, if practicable, on such
documents and on any submissions the Buyer intends to deliver or submit to the
appropriate Governmental Entity prior to said submission (it being understood
that no Buyer Party shall be obligated hereby or otherwise to accept any such
comments or to otherwise


                                      -64-
<PAGE>

reflect any of them in any such documents or submissions). The Principal Sellers
may, at their own expense, hire their own consultants, attorneys or other
professionals in connection with any such claim, and the Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate with the Principal Sellers' in connection therewith, including (upon
reasonable prior notice) making relevant employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries reasonably available to the Principal Sellers in connection with
such claim. Notwithstanding the above, the Principal Sellers shall not
unreasonably interfere with the Buyer's business or operations or any matter
before the Governmental Entity.

          (e) The Holdback Amount shall not be available to the Buyer Parties
for any Environmental Damages for a particular Environmental Site, unless the
amount of the Environmental Damages for such Environmental Site exceeds the
Environmental Reserved Amount for such Environmental Site, and then only for the
amount of Environmental Damages incurred above the Environmental Reserved Amount
for such Environmental Site. To the extent that all or any portion of the
then-remaining Environmental Reserved Amount for any particular Environmental
Site exceeds the amount required to be reserved on the books and records of the
Company in accordance with GAAP with respect to such Environmental Site (such
excess hereinafter referred to as "Excess Environmental Reserves"), then, prior
to utilizing the Holdback Amount for any other Environmental Site, the Buyer
Parties shall first be required to apply the Excess Environmental Reserves in
their entirety (in addition to any Environmental Reserved Amount for such other
Environmental Site).

          (f) The Holdback Amount shall not be available to the Buyer Parties
for any Litigation Damages for a particular Specified Proceeding, unless the
amount of the Litigation Damages for such Specified Proceeding exceeds the
Litigation Reserved Amount for such Specified Proceeding, and then only for the
amount of Litigation Damages incurred above the Litigation Reserved Amount for
such Specified Proceeding. To the extent that all or any portion of the
then-remaining Litigation Reserved Amount for any particular Specified
Proceeding exceeds the amount required to be reserved on the books and records
of the Company in accordance with GAAP with respect to such Specified Proceeding
(such excess hereinafter referred to as "Excess Litigation Reserves"), then,
prior to utilizing the Holdback Amount for any other Specified Proceeding, the
Buyer Parties shall first be required to apply the Excess Litigation Reserves in
their entirety (in addition to any Litigation Reserved Amount for such other
Specified Proceeding).

          (g) Subject to the applicable terms, conditions and limitations of
this Section 13.5, the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to collect from the
Holdback Amount with respect to 90% of the amount of Environmental Damages,
Litigation Damages or (to the extent resulting from a Third-Party Claim) Breach
Damages, as the case may be, and the Buyer Parties shall be solely responsible
for 10% of the amount of such Environmental Damages, Litigation Damages or (to
the extent resulting from a Third-Party Claim) Breach Damages, with no right or
remedy against the Sellers with respect to such 10% amount. The Holdback Amount
shall not be available to the Buyer Parties for any Breach Damages unless the
aggregate amount of all such Breach Damages exceeds One Million Dollars
($1,000,000), in which case the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to collect from
the Holdback Amount the entire amount of such Breach Damages (up to the Holdback
Amount).

          (h) With respect to Environmental Damages (subject to Section
13.5(g)):

                                      -65-
<PAGE>

               (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
     Section 13.5, the Buyer shall have the right to control the management of
     an investigation or Remediation of a release of Hazardous Materials at any
     Environmental Site; provided, however, that such activities by the Buyer
     shall be performed at a reasonable cost, in accordance with applicable Laws
     and consistent with good environmental consulting and engineering
     practices. The Buyer shall promptly provide copies to the Principal Sellers
     of all material notices, correspondence, draft reports, submissions, work
     plans, and final reports and shall give each of the Principal Sellers a
     reasonable opportunity (at such Principal Seller's own expense) to comment
     in advance, if practicable, on such documents and on any submissions the
     Buyer intends to deliver or submit to the appropriate Governmental Entity
     prior to said submission (it being understood that no Buyer Party shall be
     obligated hereby or otherwise to accept any such comments or to otherwise
     reflect any of them in any such documents or submissions). The Principal
     Sellers may, at their own expense, hire their own consultants, attorneys or
     other professionals to monitor the investigation and remediation, including
     any field work undertaken by the Buyer, and the Buyer shall reasonably
     cooperate with the Principal Sellers' monitoring, including (upon
     reasonable prior notice) making relevant employees of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries available in connection with, and shall promptly provide the
     Principal Sellers with the results of, all such field work. Notwithstanding
     the above, the Principal Sellers shall not unreasonably interfere with the
     Buyer's business or operations or the performance of any such investigation
     or remediation.

               (ii) With respect to cleanup costs (or other reasonably
     associated expenses), the Buyer Parties may only seek reimbursement from
     the Holdback Amount to the extent that: (A) cleanup (or other reasonably
     associated activities) of the Hazardous Materials is required by a
     Governmental Entity under an applicable Environmental Law; (B) the
     Remediation Standards that must be met in order to satisfy the requirements
     of the applicable Environmental Law or Governmental Entity as of the date
     of any cleanup (or other reasonably associated activity) are those
     Remediation Standards that would be the least stringent Remediation
     Standards that would be applicable given the use of the Environmental Site
     as of the day before the Closing Date; and (C) such cleanup (or other
     reasonably associated activity) is conducted using cost effective methods
     for investigation, removal, remediation and/or containment consistent with
     applicable Environmental Law or the requirements of a Governmental Entity.
     To the extent that the cleanup costs incurred by the Buyer Parties in
     connection with a cleanup to which the Holdback Amount applies do not
     satisfy the conditions set forth in this Section 13.5(h), then the Buyer
     Parties shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Holdback Amount for
     only such amount of such cleanup costs that they would have incurred if
     they had conducted the cleanup in accordance with the conditions of this
     Section 13.5(h).

               (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
     Sellers and the Buyer agree that: (A) if the cost of cleanup or correcting
     a non-compliance with the Environmental Law for an Environmental Site is
     increased after the Closing Date due to an act or omission after the
     Closing by any Person other than the Sellers or their Affiliates (which
     shall not include the Company or its Subsidiaries) or any of their
     respective employees or representatives or any Governmental Entity, the
     Buyer Parties shall not be entitled to reimbursement from the Holdback
     Amount for any such increase


                                      -66-
<PAGE>

     in costs incurred; (B) the Buyer Parties shall not be entitled to
     reimbursement from the Holdback Amount for any capital improvements and
     repairs and modifications to capital improvements associated with any
     Environmental Site, other than to the extent required in connection with
     the cleanup of environmental conditions (or other reasonably associated
     activities) at an Environmental Site that existed on the Closing Date; and
     (C) the Buyer shall not be entitled to reimbursement from the Holdback
     Amount to the extent any costs are incurred due to any change related to
     the Environmental Site that the Company owned, operated, occupied or leased
     as of the Closing Date, or arising from the closure or sale of a facility
     or business, the construction of new structures or equipment, a
     modification to existing structures or equipment, the excavation or
     movement of soil, or a change in use of the facilities from manufacturing
     to any other use.

          (i) On the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, an amount equal to
(i) the Holdback Amount, less (ii) the sum of (A) any amounts previously paid
out of the Holdback Amount in respect of any Company Liabilities as provided in
this Section 13.5; (B) an estimate (mutually agreed upon by the Buyer and the
Majority Sellers) of any amounts (collectively, the "Holdback Reserve Amount")
necessary to satisfy pending claims by any Buyer Party in respect of any (x)
Company Liabilities (other than Environmental Damages, Litigation Damages and
Breach Damages resulting from a breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 5.16(g)(iii) ( "Section 5.16(g)(iii) Damages")) for which
notice was received by the Principal Sellers on or prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) Environmental Damages, Litigation
Damages and/or Section 5.16(g)(iii) Damages for which notice was received by the
Principal Sellers on or prior to the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, and

and paid to the Sellers pursuant to Section 13.5(d) or 13.5(j) shall be paid by
the Buyer to the Sellers pro rata, in accordance with each Seller's
Proportionate Interest, in accordance with written instructions from the
Majority Sellers, out of the then remaining Holdback Amount (if any), without
any interest or other income accruing or earned thereon; provided, however, that
promptly after the satisfaction or resolution of all pending claims for which
notice was received by the Principal Sellers prior to, with respect to Company
Liabilities (other than Environmental Damages and Litigation Damages and Section
5.16(g)(iii) Damages), the second anniversary of the Closing Date and, with
respect to Environmental Damages, Litigation Damages and/or Section 5.16(g)(iii)
Damages, the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, the then remaining portion
of the Holdback Reserve Amount (less the amount paid to satisfy such claims
pursuant to this Section 13.5) shall be paid by the Buyer to the Sellers pro
rata, in accordance with each Seller's Proportionate Interest, in accordance
with written instructions from the Majority Sellers), without any interest or
other income accruing or earned thereon. In the event that the Buyer and the
Majority Sellers are unable to mutually agree upon the amount of the Holdback
Reserve Amount, then, pending resolution of such dispute, the Buyer shall be
entitled to continue to reserve and retain (in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Section 13.5) the Buyer's estimate of the Holdback Reserve
Amount.

          (j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any damages,
awards, judgments, settlements or other recoveries ("Recoveries") actually
received by any Buyer Party (including, from and after the Closing, the Company
or any Subsidiary) from time to time after the Closing arising from or relating
to the Proceedings listed in Section 13.5(j) of the Disclosure Schedule (or any
other Proceedings or claims resulting from the same underlying facts or

occurrences) (the "Insurance Proceedings") shall be for the credit of the
Sellers and, promptly upon receipt of any such Recoveries by the Buyer Parties,
a portion of the Holdback Amount equal to the amount of such Recoveries (net of
costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer Parties in connection obtaining such
Recoveries) shall be released and paid by the Buyer to the Sellers pro rata, in
accordance with each Seller's Proportionate Interest, in accordance with written
instructions from the Majority Sellers); provided, however, that in no event
shall the aggregate amount released to the Sellers pursuant to this Section
13.5(j) exceed the then remaining balance of the Holdback Amount. In connection
therewith, the Buyer shall cause the Company or the appropriate Subsidiary to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to perfect and preserve any potential
claim under such Insurance Proceedings.

          14.5. Assignment and Benefit.

          (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.
Neither this Agreement, nor any of the rights hereunder or thereunder, may be
assigned by any party, nor may any party delegate any obligations hereunder or
thereunder, without the written consent of the other party hereto or thereto;
provided, however, that (i) the Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to one or
more of its wholly owned subsidiaries or, from and after the Closing, to the
Buyer's lenders; provided, that no such assignment shall relieve the Buyer of
any of its obligations hereunder, and (ii) following the Closing Date, any
Seller may assign its rights, but not its obligations, hereunder. Any assignment
or attempted assignment other than in accordance with this Section 14.5(a) shall
be void ab initio.

          (b) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 7.13, 12.2, 13.2 and
13.5, this Agreement shall not be construed as giving any Person, other than the
parties hereto and their permitted successors, heirs and assigns, any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any of
the provisions herein contained, this Agreement and all provisions and
conditions hereof being intended to be, and being, for the sole and exclusive
benefit of such parties, and permitted successors, heirs and assigns and for the
benefit of no other Person. The parties hereto expressly intend the provisions
of Sections 7.13, 12.2, 13.2 and 13.5 to confer a benefit upon and be
enforceable by, as third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, the third
persons referred to in, or intended to be benefited by, such provisions.

          14.6. Amendment, Modification and Waiver.

          The parties hereto may amend or modify, or may waive any right or
obligation under, this Agreement in any respect, provided that any such
amendment, modification or waiver shall be in writing and executed by the Buyer,
the Company and the Majority Sellers. The waiver of any breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not constitute or operate as a waiver of any other
breach of such provision or of any other provision hereof, nor shall any failure
to enforce any provision hereof operate as a waiver of such provision or of any
other provision hereof.

          14.7. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.

          This Agreement is made pursuant to, and shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (and United
States federal Law, to the extent applicable), irrespective of the principal
place of business, residence or domicile of the parties hereto, and without
giving effect to otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of law. Any legal
action, suit or Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement (other
than in connection with the dispute resolved by the Resolving Accountant
pursuant to Section 3.2) shall be instituted in any federal court or in any
state court in the State of New York, and each party waives any objection which
such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
action, suit or Proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any
such court. Any and all service of process and any other notice in any such
action, suit or Proceeding shall be effective against any party if given as
provided herein. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of
any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

          14.8. Section Headings and Defined Terms.

          The Section headings contained herein are for reference purposes only
and shall not in any way affect the meaning and interpretation of this
Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, all agreements defined herein refer to
the same as from time to time amended or supplemented or the terms thereof
waived or modified in accordance herewith and therewith.

          14.9. Severability.

          The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision, or
part of any provision, of this Agreement shall not affect the other provisions
or parts hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if
such invalid or unenforceable provisions or parts were omitted.

          14.10. Effectiveness; Counterparts.

          (a) This Agreement shall become effective, and shall be binding upon
the Buyer, the Company and the Sellers, at such time as it shall have been
executed and delivered by the Buyer, the Company and the Principal Sellers.

          (b) This Agreement and the other documents required to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original (including facsimile signatures), and
any Person may become a party


                                      -72-
<PAGE>

hereto by executing a counterpart hereof, but all of such counterparts together
shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. The parties hereto may
deliver this Agreement and the other documents required to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein by telecopier machine/facsimile and each party
shall be permitted to rely upon the signatures so transmitted to the same extent
and effect as if they were original signatures.

          14.11. Entire Agreement.

          This Agreement, together with the Disclosure Schedule, the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and the exhibits hereto, all of which shall be incorporated
herein, the Seller Closing Documents, the Company Closing Documents and the
Buyer Closing Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement, and the schedules and
certificates referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, constitute the
entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings with respect to
such subject matter.
