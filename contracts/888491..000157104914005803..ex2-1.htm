Agreement

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

AGREEMENT - THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the DGCL and the MGCL, at the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall be
merged with and into Merger Sub, whereupon the separate existence of the
Company will cease, with Merger Sub surviving the Merger (Merger Sub, as the
surviving entity in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the
"Surviving Entity"), such that following the Merger, the Surviving Entity will
be a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall have the effects
provided in this Agreement and as specified in the DGCL and the MGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after
the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall possess all properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Merger Sub and the Company,
and all of the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the
Merger Sub and the Company shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities,
debts and duties of the Surviving Entity.

  

  

Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place
(a) at 10:00 a.m., New York time, at the Atlanta, Georgia offices of Bryan
Cave LLP, on the third (3rd) business day after the satisfaction or waiver of
the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied or waived
(other than any such conditions that by their nature, including Section
7.1(e), are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at the Closing) or (b) at such other date or place
as is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent, provided that (i) the
Closing shall be delayed as provided in Section 6.19(d) to the extent
applicable and (ii) if the Closing would otherwise occur on a date that is
within thirty (30) days prior to the end of Parent's then current fiscal
quarter, Parent may elect to defer the Closing to the first (1st) business day
after the end of such fiscal quarter of Parent, subject to the Company's
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "Closing
Date."

  

  

Section 1.3 Effective Time. On the Closing Date, the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall (a) cause articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the
"Articles of Merger") to be duly executed and filed with the State Department
of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the "SDAT") in accordance with the
MGCL, (b) cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") to be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware ( the "Delaware Secretary") in accordance with
the DGCL and (c) make any other filings, recordings or publications required
to be made by the Company or Merger Sub under the DGCL or the MGCL in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
both (a) the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT and (b)
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary, or on
such other date and time (not to exceed five (5) business days after the later
of (x) the date the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT and
(y) the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary) as
shall be agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the Articles of
Merger and the Certificate of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter
referred to as the "Merger Effective Time").

Section 1.4 Governing Documents. At the Merger Effective Time, the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time in form mutually agreed to by the Company and
Parent, shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Entity, until thereafter amended, subject to Section 6.4, in accordance with
applicable Law and the applicable provisions of such charter and bylaws.

  

  

Section 1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Entity. The directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be
and become the directors and officers of the Surviving Entity as of the Merger
Effective Time.

  

  

Section 1.6 Tax Consequences. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted
as, a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

  

  

Section 1.7 Subsequent Actions. If at any time after the Merger Effective Time
the Surviving Entity shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion,
that any actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity its right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights or properties of the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the Surviving Entity may
take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right,
title or interest in, to or under such rights or properties in the Surviving

ARTICLE II

  

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

  

  

Section 2.1 Treatment of Capital Stock. At the Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of the Company or of Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Treatment of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other
than Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with this paragraph (a))
shall be exchanged for the right to receive nine-tenths (0.90) of a duly
authorized, fully paid, non-assessable and validly issued share of Parent
Common Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.1(c) (such ratio,
the "Exchange Ratio," and all such shares, the "Merger Consideration");
provided, however, that each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time that is held by the
Company or any wholly-owned Company Subsidiary shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto. From and after the Merger
Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a Company Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive Parent Common Stock in exchange therefor upon the
surrender of such Company Share in accordance with Section 2.2, including the
right to receive, pursuant to Section 2.6, cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock, if any, for which such shares of Company Common Stock
have the right to be exchanged pursuant to this Section 2.1 (the "Fractional
Share Consideration"), together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(f).

--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(b) Treatment of Merger Sub Stock. All shares of stock of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding as shares of capital stock of the Surviving Entity.

  

  

(c) Adjustment to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and
prior to the Merger Effective Time so as to provide the holders of Company
Common Stock with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Exchange Ratio.

  

  

Section 2.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Exchange Fund. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall designate
an exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Prior
to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Merger Sub to
deposit, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-
entry form issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) equal to the aggregate number
of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1
(excluding any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately
available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Fractional Share
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions under Section 2.2(f)
(such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts,
the "Exchange Fund"), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and the Surviving Entity (in the case of the
Surviving Entity, solely to the extent any amounts in the Exchange Fund are in
excess of the amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Fractional Share
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions under Section 2.2(f),
Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds
with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the
amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the shares of Parent
Common Stock for which shares of Company Common Stock are to be exchanged,
including any Fractional Share Consideration and any amounts payable in
accordance with Section 2.2(f) out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with
this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is
not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent;
provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall in all events be
limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial
paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Entity on the
earlier of one (1) year after the Merger Effective Time or the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1
and aggregate Fractional Share Consideration has been paid in full; provided,
that any amounts in the Exchange Fund in excess of the amounts payable under
Section 2.1(a) shall be promptly paid to the Surviving Entity.

(b) Procedures for Surrender. Promptly after the Merger Effective Time (but in
no event later than five (5) business days after the Merger Effective Time),
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, cause the Exchange
Agent to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares (the "Certificates"), or
uncertificated Company Shares ("Book-Entry Shares"), and in each case whose
Company Shares were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.1 for the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock, (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of shares
of Parent Common Stock for which such Company Shares are to be exchanged,
including, any amount payable in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.6, and any dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.2(f). Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent
or the Surviving Entity, together with such letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) the shares of Parent Common Stock for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (rounded down to the
nearest whole share), (B) a check or wire transfer representing any Fractional
Share Consideration that such holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6, and (C) any
amounts that such holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share has the right to
receive in respect of dividends or other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.2(f) for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share. The amounts due pursuant to clauses (A), (B) and (C)
shall be mailed to such holder (or made available for collection by hand if so
elected by the surrendering holder) within five (5) business days following
the later to occur of the Merger Effective Time or the Exchange Agent's
receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Entity that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be
paid. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall at any time after the Merger
Effective Time represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, including any amount payable
in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with Section
2.6 and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section
2.2(f), without interest thereon. Shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable
pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the
Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Merger Effective
Time, the holders of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, after the Merger Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund
that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject
only to the Exchange Agent's routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Entity and Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the applicable Merger Consideration, including any amount payable
in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with Section
2.6 and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section
2.2(f), payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b), without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, Parent
or the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent, and if required by the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, the posting by the holder thereof of a
bond in the amount and the form reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange
Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Entity with respect to such Certificates, the applicable Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1, including
any amount payable in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.6 and any dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.2(f).

  

  

(f) Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions paid
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange
Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record
date after the Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender, previously
paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock.

  

  

Section 2.3 Dissenter's Rights. No dissenters' or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions.

  

  

Section 2.4 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

  

  

(a) Stock Options and Restricted Stock. Each option to acquire Company Common
Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") and restricted stock award with respect
to Company Common Stock ("Restricted Company Shares") granted before the
Closing Date under Company Equity Plans to an employee or a non-employee
director (each a "Participant") that is in effect as of the Closing Date shall
remain in effect until such Company Stock Option or Restricted Company Share
award expires, is terminated, is forfeited or settled in accordance with the
terms of the Company Equity Plans or underlying award agreement governing such
Company Stock Option or Restricted Company Shares; provided, however, that
upon and following the Merger Effective Time, (i) such Company Stock Option or
Restricted Company Shares shall cease to be exercisable for or relate to
shares of Company Common Stock, but instead shall be exercisable for or relate
to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the closest
whole share) equal to nine-tenths (0.90) of a share of Parent Common Stock,
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.1(c), multiplied by the number
of shares of Company Common Stock as to which the Company Stock Option or
Restricted Company Shares related immediately before the Merger Effective
Time, (ii) Restricted Company Shares for any individual who is a non-employee
director of the Company immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall
be 100% vested, and (iii) the exercise price per share of each Company Stock
Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
immediately before the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the closest whole cent.

(b) Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. All performance-based restricted
stock units relating to Company Common Stock ("Company PSUs") granted before
the Closing Date under Company Equity Plans that remain in place for
Participants employed or engaged by the Company as of the Closing Date shall
be deemed to be vested and earned as of the Closing Date to the extent the
applicable performance goals have been achieved as of (i) December 31, 2014
with respect to awards with performance periods that started before December
31, 2014, or (ii) the Closing Date with respect to awards with performance
periods that started upon or after December 31, 2014, in each case rather than
at the end of the applicable performance period determined in accordance with
the pre-existing award agreement, but shall cease to be payable in shares of
Company Common Stock, but instead shall be payable on the Closing Date for a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the closest whole
share) determined by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the vested portion of the Company PSUs.

  

  

(c) Class I Units. Each Class I unit of LG Aviv LP held by each holder of an
option to acquire Company Common Stock shall remain in place while the option
remains outstanding and shall be cancelled upon the cancellation, forfeiture,
termination or settlement of the option in accordance with the terms of the
operating agreement of LG Aviv LP.

  

  

(d) Time-Based Restricted Stock Units. All time-based restricted stock units
relating to Company Common Stock ("Company RSUs" and, together with the
Restricted Company Shares, Company Stock Options and Company PSUs, the
"Company Equity Awards") granted before the Closing Date under Company Equity
Plans to a Participant who (i) ceases to be employed or engaged by the Company
or a Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date and does not continue to be
employed or engaged by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary immediately following the
Closing Date and that has not before the Closing Date expired or been
cancelled, forfeited, terminated or settled shall be 100% vested as of the
Closing Date and shall be cancelled by the Company as of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that such Company RSUs shall cease to be payable in shares
of Company Common Stock, but instead shall be payable on the Closing Date for
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the closest whole
share) determined by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSUs, or (ii) is employed or
engaged by the Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date and
continues to be employed or engaged by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary
immediately following the Closing Date shall remain in effect until such
Company RSUs expire, are terminated, are forfeited or are settled in
accordance with the terms of the Company Equity Plans or the underlying award
agreements governing such awards; provided, however, that upon and following
the Merger Effective Time, such Company RSUs shall cease to be payable when
due in shares of Company Common Stock, but instead shall be payable when due
in a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the closest
whole share) equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock as to which the Company RSUs related immediately before
the Merger Effective Time.

(e) No Accelerated Vesting. Except as (i) required pursuant to Section
5.3(iii) of the Employment Agreement between Aviv Asset Management, L.L.C. and
Mark Wetzel effective November 8, 2013, (ii) provided in any written agreement
between a Participant and the Company with respect to which Parent has given
its written consent, (iii) provided in any written agreement between a
Participant and the Parent, (iv) provided in the change in control severance
agreements and transition agreements approved for the employees listed in
Schedule 5.1(b)(xvii) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (v) as otherwise
provided in this Section 2.4, there shall be no acceleration of vesting of any
awards granted under the Company Equity Plans before the Closing Date as a
result of the Closing or any Participant's termination of employment or
service. All Company RSUs described in Section 2.4(d)(ii) that are in effect
as of the Closing Date for any Participant who is employed or engaged by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date and continues to be
employed or engaged by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary immediately following the
Closing Date shall, if such award has not previously expired, vest 100% if the
employment or service of the Participant is terminated by Parent without Cause
before the first anniversary of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section
2.4(e), "Cause" means the occurrence of any of the following events: (i)
refusal or failure by the employee to follow a lawful direction of the Chief
Executive Officer of Parent or other employee of Parent or a Parent Subsidiary
who is the employee's supervisor or failure to perform any material duties of
employment, in each case as reasonably determined by Parent and after written
notice of such failure is provided to the Participant (excluding any failure,
other than repeated failures, which is remedied by the Participant within ten
days after written notice of such failure); (ii) willful misconduct or willful
disregard by the Participant of his duties or with respect to the interest or
material property of Parent or a Parent Subsidiary; (iii) disclosure by the
employee to an unauthorized person of confidential or proprietary information
of the Company or Parent or any of their affiliates; (iv) any act by the
Participant of fraud against, misappropriation from, or significant dishonesty
to either the Company or Parent or an affiliate of either; (v) commission by
the Participant of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, in
either case as reasonably determined by Parent; or (vi) a material breach of
any agreement between the Participant and Parent or one of its affiliates by
the Participant, provided that the nature of such breach shall be set forth
with reasonable particularity in a written notice to Participant and
Participant shall have the opportunity to cure such breach within ten days
after written notice of such breach, provided that such breach is, in the
reasonable opinion of Parent, susceptible to a cure.

  

  

(f) Effectuation of this Section. Before the Merger Effective Time, (i) the
Company and Parent shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the
requirements of this Section 2.4, (ii) the Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that, except as set forth in this Section 2.4, no
Participant has any rights with respect to the Company Equity Plans that are
inconsistent with this Section 2.4, and (iii) the Company shall cause any
other awards, if any, not described in this Section 2.4 under the Company
Equity Plans to be cancelled without any payment therefor. As of the Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company Equity Plans that related to
Company Common Stock as to which any obligation remains outstanding or with
respect to which shares remain available for issuance.

Section 2.5 Withholding. All amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall
be paid without interest (unless otherwise noted). Any payments made pursuant
to this Agreement shall be net of all applicable withholding Taxes that the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, shall be required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law
(including, but not limited to, Section 1445 of the Code). To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by the applicable payor and remitted to
the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

Section 2.6 No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, no certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder
of Parent. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, Parent shall pay each holder of Company Common Stock an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional
share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock held at the Merger Effective Time by such holder) would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing price on the NYSE, as reported on
the consolidated tape at the close of the NYSE regular session of trading, for
a share of Parent Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding
the Merger Effective Time.

  

  

Section 2.7 Treatment of Company OP Units. In connection with the Partnership
Combination contemplated by Section 6.16, following the Partnership
Combination Effective Time, the Company Operating Partnership shall distribute
to the holders of Company OP Units in existence immediately prior to the
Partnership Combination Effective Time, the Parent Partnership Units issued to
the Company Operating Partnership in connection with the Partnership
Combination. If requested by Parent no less than five (5) business days before
the Closing Date, the Company shall cause such distribution to be declared and
issued prior to the Merger Effective Time.

involves management or other individuals who have a significant role in the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting, and the Company has made

Parent Partnership are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
disclosures (a) in the Parent SEC Documents (excluding any disclosures under
the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking Statements" or any other
disclosures contained therein to the extent they are predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature) filed on or after January 1, 2013 and prior to the
date hereof (and then (i) only to the extent that the relevance of any
disclosed event, item or occurrence in such Parent SEC Documents to a matter
covered by a representation or warranty set forth in this Article IV is
reasonably apparent on its face as to matters and items which are the subject
of such representation or warranty, and (ii) other than matters required to be
disclosed for purposes of Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.8(b), which matters shall
only be qualified by specific disclosure in the respective corresponding
Section of the Parent Disclosure Letter), and (b) set forth in Parent's
disclosure letter delivered to the Company immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter"). Each disclosure set forth
in the Parent Disclosure Letter shall qualify the Section to which it
corresponds and any other Section to the extent the applicability of the
disclosure to each other Section is reasonably apparent on its face from the
text of the disclosure made. The following representations are made by Parent,
Merger Sub and the Parent Partnership on a joint and several basis. The

jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its

each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,

(together with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
(such documents and any other documents filed or furnished by the Company with
the SEC, as have been amended since the time of their filing, collectively,
the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective filing dates (or the date
of their most recent amendment, supplement or modification), the Parent SEC
Documents (i) did not (or with respect to Parent SEC Documents filed after the
date hereof, will not) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which

applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. All of the audited
financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of Parent
included in the Parent SEC Documents (including the related notes and

Section 4.7 Internal Controls; Sarbanes-Oxley Act; Improper Payments.

  

  

(a) The Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a
system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorizations, (iii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements and to maintain asset accountability, (iv)
that access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
general or specific authorization, (v) that the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences and (vi) accounts,
notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper
and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. Since January 1, 2011, (A) Parent has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to Parent's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure, (B) to the knowledge of Parent, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of Parent to material
information required to be included in Parent's periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act and (C) to the knowledge of Parent, the principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of Parent have disclosed to
Parent's auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board of Directors
(and made summaries of such disclosures available to the Company) (1) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect Parent's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other individuals who have a significant
role in Parent's internal controls over financial reporting. Since January 1,
2011, neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited
loans to any director or executive officer of the Parent (as defined in Rule
3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).

(b) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any
solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any Persons with respect to a
Competing Proposal, use reasonable best efforts to take such reasonable action
as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality or standstill or provisions of
similar effect to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a party or of
which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a beneficiary, and use reasonable
best efforts to cause any such Person to promptly return and/or destroy all
confidential information concerning the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries
to the extent permitted pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with any such
Persons that was provided in connection with a Competing Proposal.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if (i) at any
time on or after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a
written Competing Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which
Competing Proposal was made on or after the date hereof and was not solicited
in breach by the Company of this Section 5.3 and (ii) the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and an independent financial advisor of national reputation, that such
Competing Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (A) furnish, pursuant
to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or
group of Persons who has made such Competing Proposal, provided, that the
Company shall promptly provide to Parent any material non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives, and (B) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Competing
Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event, within twenty-four
(24) hours) notify Parent and Merger Sub after it or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives has received a Competing Proposal
or the initial request for non-public information concerning the Company or

the Person making such request and include the material terms and conditions

(d) Following the date hereof, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal (whether made
before or after the date hereof) and upon the request of Parent shall apprise
Parent of the status of such Competing Proposal. The Company agrees that it
and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.3.

  

  

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(e) with respect to the
Company or Section 5.3(f) with respect to the Company and Parent, the Company
Board of Directors, the Parent Board of Directors and any of their respective

stockholders that the Company Stockholder Approval or Parent Stockholder
Approval, as applicable, be given or fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation or Parent Board Recommendation, as applicable, in the Joint
Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or, in a manner
adverse to the other Party, modify, the Company Board Recommendation or Parent
Board Recommendation, as applicable, (C) adopt, approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a
Competing Proposal or (D) fail to recommend against any pending tender or
exchange offer that constitutes a Competing Proposal within ten (10) business
days after it is launched (it being understood and agreed that the Company
stating that it is continuing to negotiate with the Person that made such
Competing Proposal shall not in of itself constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change, provided that the such statement is accompanied by an express
statement that the Company Board of Directors has not as of such time changed
the Company Board Recommendation and is reaffirming the Company Board
Recommendation) (each of the actions described in this clause (i) being
referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Company
Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or
(iii) take any action pursuant to Section 8.1(f). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, but not after, the Company Board of Directors may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f)
and enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Competing
Proposal, if and only if, the Company receives a Competing Proposal that was
not solicited in breach by the Company of this Section 5.3 and that the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and after obtaining and taking into account the advice
of the Company's independent financial advisor of national reputation,
constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, that in order to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal:

  

  

(i) the Company Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors' duties under applicable Law;

  

  

(ii) the Company shall have given Parent at least five (5) business days'
prior written notice of its intention to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), which notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the Adverse Recommendation
Change or termination and the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal and the material terms thereof and include copies of the current
drafts of all material agreements between the Company and the party making
such Superior Proposal that relate to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that such notice or the public disclosure by the Company
of such notice shall not in and of itself constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change provided that such public disclosure is accompanied by an express
statement that the Company Board of Directors has not as of such time changed
the Company Board Recommendation);

  

   

66 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(iii) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate; and

  

  

(iv) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors
shall have considered in good faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement
proposed by Parent (or as to other proposals made by Parent), and shall have
determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and after
obtaining and taking into account the advice of the Company's independent
financial advisor of national reputation that such Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such revisions were to be
given effect; provided, that in the event of any material change to the
material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case,
have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described
in clause (ii) above and the notice period shall have recommenced (in which
case such notice period shall be for three (3) business days instead of five
(5) business days); and provided, further, that any purported termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(e) shall be void and of no force
and effect, unless the Company termination is in accordance with Section
8.1(f) and the Company pays Parent the Company Termination Payment in
accordance with Section 8.2(b) prior to or concurrently with such termination.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board of
Directors may, and prior to the time of the Parent Stockholder Approval is
obtained, but not after, the Parent Board of Directors may, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if:

  

  

(i) a material favorable development or change in circumstances occurs for
such Party after the date of this Agreement that (A) is not related to any
Competing Proposal or Parent Acquisition Transaction, as applicable, (B)
relates to the business, properties, assets, or prospects of the Party
proposing to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section
5.3(f), and (C) was neither known by nor reasonably foreseeable to the Company
Board or Parent Board, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement (an
"Intervening Event");

  

  

(ii) the Company Board of Directors or Parent Board of Directors, as
applicable, shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, as a result of
such Intervening Event, failure to take such action would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the directors' duties under applicable Law;

  

   

67 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(iii) the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall have given the other Party
at least five (5) business days' prior written notice of its intention to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.3(f)(i) (which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the Adverse
Recommendation Change);

  

  

(iv) the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall have negotiated, and shall
have caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the other
Party and its Representatives during such notice period, to the extent such
other Party wishes to negotiate; and

  

  

(v) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors or
Parent Board of Directors, as applicable, shall have considered in good faith
any proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed by the other Party (or as to
other proposals made by the other Party), and shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that, as a result of such Intervening Event, failure to make
such Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors' duties under applicable Law even if such
revisions were to be given effect.

  

  

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company Board of Directors
from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate
applicable Law, (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the
Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (iii) making any other disclosure required under applicable
Law, in any such case, if the Company Board of Directors has determined in
good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the failure to do so
would create a material risk of a breach by the Company Board of Directors of
its duties; provided, that any disclosures (other than those made pursuant to
clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(g)) that are not an express rejection of any
applicable Competing Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation shall be considered in determining whether there has been an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

  

(h) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 5.3 by any Subsidiary of the Company or the
Representatives of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company acting at the
direction of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company.

  

  

(i) As used in this Agreement, "Competing Proposal" shall mean any proposal or
offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or "group",
within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, any (i) acquisition of
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the
Company's consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the Company's
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii)
acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
(iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in such
Person or "group" acquiring beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (iv) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary that if
consummated would result in Persons other the holders of Company Parent Common
Stock immediately prior to such transaction owning more than 20% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock or stock of the ultimate parent entity
immediately following such transaction or (v) any combination of the foregoing
types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets,
consolidated revenues or earnings and Company Common Stock involved is 20% or
more, in each case, other than the Transactions.

(j) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written Competing Proposal that was not the result of a breach by the Company
of this Section 5.3 and that the Company Board of Directors has determined,
after consulting with the Company's outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisor of national reputation is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms and that if consummated, and taking
into account all financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the
transaction described in such Competing Proposal, would reasonably be likely
to result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger and the other Transactions (including
any bona fide written revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such proposal or otherwise); provided, that for purposes
of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" in the
definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

  

  

Section 5.4 Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement.

Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and, to the extent
required under applicable SEC rules, cause to be filed with the SEC the Joint
Proxy Statement, and (ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the
SEC the Form S-4 with respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable in the
Merger, which will include the Joint Proxy Statement with respect to the
Company Stockholder Meeting and Parent Stockholder Meeting. Each of the

Joint Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify
the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy
Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written
comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received
from the SEC and advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect to
the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the
Form S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide
the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response (including the proposed final version of such document or response).

the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order
relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Parent shall also use reasonable best efforts to take
any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the Parent
Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
or the Parent Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and,
to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in
such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company and the
stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this Section 5.4(b) shall limit the
obligations of any Party under Section 5.4(a). For purposes of this Section
5.4, any information concerning or related to the Company, its affiliates or
the Company Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the
Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent, its affiliates
or the Parent Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by
Parent.

  

  

(c) As promptly as practicable following the effective date of the Form S-4,
the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Governing
Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and

best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder
Meeting and to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable

shall, through the Company Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders
that they give the Company Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the
Company Board of Directors shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by Section 5.3; provided, however, the Company's obligation to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting shall
be unconditional unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms and shall not be affected by any Adverse Recommendation Change.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.4(c), if, on a date
for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common
Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, Parent may require the Company, and the Company shall have the right,
to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (provided, that the
Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned to a date that
is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Company Stockholder
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable Law)); provided, however, the Company Stockholder
Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned on the date the Company Stockholder
Meeting is scheduled if the Company shall have received proxies in respect of
an aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock, which have not been
withdrawn, such that the Company Stockholder Approval will be obtained at such
meeting.

Statement, and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Parent Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Parent Board of
Directors shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by
Section 5.3; provided, however, Parent's obligation to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholder Meeting shall be unconditional
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and shall not
be affected by any Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.4(d), if, on a date for which the
Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain
the Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the
Company may require Parent, and Parent shall have the right, to adjourn or

Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty

postponed or adjourned on the date the Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled
if Parent shall have received proxies in respect of an aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, which have not been withdrawn, such that Parent
Stockholder Approval will be obtained at such meeting.

  

  

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting on
the same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this

upon advice of counsel, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause
each of the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, to
afford to the other Party and its Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of their
respective properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and

to or to disclose information, (i) that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (provided, however,
that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (ii) the
disclosure of which would violate any Law or duty (provided, however, that
withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of
any Law or duty) or (iii) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege (provided, however, that withholding
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such
attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege). Each of
Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any
disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may result from the
requests for access, data and information hereunder.

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including

required in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions, or (C) of
any written notice received from any Person in connection with (1) any
material violation or default under or notice to terminate, not renew or
challenge the validity or enforceability of any Company Material Contract,
Material Company Lease, Parent Material Contract or Parent Material Lease, or
(2) any event or circumstance that would give rise to any option to purchase,
right of first refusal or first offer, or any other right to purchase in favor
of any Person under any Company Material Contract, Company Lease, Parent
Material Contract or Parent Lease, (ii) of any Legal Proceeding commenced or,
to any Party's knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other
Transaction, and (iii) upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending
occurrence of any event, change, development or circumstance relating to it or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively,
which makes or is reasonably likely to make any of the conditions set forth in
Article VII to not be satisfied. The failure to deliver any such notice, in
and of itself, shall not result in the failure of, or otherwise affect, any of
the conditions set forth in Article VII.

Section 6.2 Consents and Approvals.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Company and Parent shall and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries, to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or pursuant to any Contract to consummate and make effective,
as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including
(i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause the conditions to Closing set
forth in Article VII to be satisfied, (ii) the preparing and filing of all
documentation to effect all required filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions and applications and the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, authorizations and approvals from
Governmental Entities or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary
to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid Legal Proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, (iii) the defending of
any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining Order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, the avoidance of
each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition or
trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall give (or shall cause to be given) any notices to any Person,
and each of Parent and the Company shall use, and cause each of their
respective affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
consents from any Person not covered by Section 6.2(a) that are necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Merger. Each of the Parties will furnish
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Entity, including promptly informing the other Party of such
inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions
to a Governmental Entity, and supplying each other with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between either Party and any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably
practicable, the Parties or their Representatives shall have the right to
review in advance and each of the Parties will consult the others on, all the
information relating to the other and each of their affiliates that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions, except that
confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from
such exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither the Company nor
Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to,
participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party prior notice of
such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
without giving the other Party the opportunity to attend or participate
(whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such Governmental
Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any approval or consent from
any Person pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) shall not be a condition to the
obligations of the Parties to consummate the Merger.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any
Governmental Entity) with respect to the Merger, none of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives, shall be obligated to pay or commit to pay to such
Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation to such Person, in each case that is not conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Closing. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Parties
shall cooperate with respect to reasonable accommodations that may be
requested or appropriate to obtain such consents. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that no approval or consent of any such Person is a condition to the
obligations of any Party to effect the Merger.

  

  

Section 6.3 Publicity. The initial press release issued by Parent and the
Company concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be a joint press release, and thereafter Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give
each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on, any press
release or other public statement with respect to the Transactions and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, duties under
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the
NYSE. Notwithstanding this Section 6.3, Parent and the Company shall not be
required to consult or obtain the consent of the other Parties prior to making
statements or issuing press releases relating to Competing Proposals or Parent
Acquisition Transactions.

  

  

Section 6.4 Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company to the fullest extent permissible
under applicable Law, under the Company Governing Documents in effect on the
date hereof and under any indemnification or other similar agreements in
effect on the date hereof previously made available to Parent (the
"Indemnification Agreements") to the individuals covered by such Company
Governing Documents, Company Subsidiary Governing Documents or Indemnification
Agreements (the "Covered Persons") arising out of or relating to actions or
omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Merger

(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.4(a), for a period of six (6)
years after the Merger Effective Time, Parent (but only to the extent the
Covered Persons would be permitted to be indemnified by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under the Company Governing Documents or the Company
Subsidiary Governing Documents and applicable Law) and the Surviving Entity
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Covered Person against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or
alleged action or omission in such Covered Person's capacity as such, or (B)
this Agreement and any of the Transactions; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
the expenses (including attorneys' fees) of any Covered Person upon receipt of
an undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to
be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity (1) shall be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent, and (2) shall have
any obligation hereunder to any Covered Person to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order
that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the
Covered Person shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the
amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

  

  

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided, that the
Company may substitute therefor policies written by carriers with A.M. Best
ratings no lower than the existing policies, providing at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or
events which occurred at or before the Merger Effective Time; provided,
however, that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments
for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual
premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such
300% amount, the "Base Premium"); provided, further, if such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual
premium in excess of the Base Premium, Parent shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Base Premium; provided, further, if the Company in
its sole discretion elects, then, in lieu of the foregoing insurance,
effective as of the Merger Effective Time, the Company may purchase a
directors' and officers' liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance
program for a period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date
hereof.

(d) In the event the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set
forth in this Section 6.4.

  

  

(e) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third-
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.4, and this Section 6.4 shall not be
amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including their
successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered Persons
(including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.

  

  

Section 6.5 Takeover Statutes. The Parties and their respective boards of
directors (or equivalent) shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
(a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all
action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover
Statute or Section 5.2 of Parent's charter or Section 7.2 of the Company
charter (collectively the "Charter Restrictions") on the Merger and the other
Transactions. No Party shall take any action to exempt any Person (other than
the other Parties or their respective affiliates) from any Takeover Statute of
any jurisdiction or the Charter Restrictions that may purport to be applicable
to the Merger or any of the other Transactions or otherwise cause any
restrictions in any Takeover Statute or the Charter Restrictions not to apply
to any such Person, except in connection with the concurrent termination of
this Agreement and entry into a Company Acquisition Agreement that constitutes
a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 8.1(f).

  

  

Section 6.6 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Entity and the Parent Partnership to

be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) and the acquisition of Parent equity securities
(including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company or who will become a
director or officer of Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.8 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting any Party's
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either Party, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Party's operations
prior to the Merger Effective Time, and (b) prior to the Merger Effective
Time, each Party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

Section 6.9 Security Holder Litigation. In the event that any Legal Proceeding
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions is brought
against the Company and/or its officers, directors and/or Representatives by
security holders of the Company (a "Security Holder Litigation"), the Company
shall promptly notify Parent of such Legal Proceeding and shall keep Parent
informed on a current basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint
defense agreement, in the defense and settlement of any such Legal Proceeding
against the Company and/or its directors by security holders of the Company,
and no settlement thereof shall be agreed to without Parent's written consent.

cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, including by executing and delivering the officers'
certificates referred to herein and reporting consistently for all federal,

shall take any action, or fail to take any action, that would reasonably be
expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

Section 6.12 Dividends.

  

  

(a) During the Interim Period, neither the Company nor Parent shall make,
declare or set aside any dividend or other distribution to its respective
stockholders without the prior written consent of the Company (in the case of
Parent) or Parent (in the case of the Company); provided, however, that the
written consent of the other Party shall not be required for the authorization
and payment of the Company Permitted Dividend or the Parent Permitted
Dividends, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other
restriction on dividends and other distributions in this Agreement, including
the restrictions set forth in Section 5.1(b)(iii) and Section 5.2(b)(iii),
each of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent and any Parent Subsidiary
shall be permitted (without the consent of the other Party) to declare and
make dividends and distributions, including under Sections 858 or 860 of the

the imposition of any entity level income or excise Tax under the Code or
applicable state Law; and

  

  

(b) Except as specifically required by Section 6.12(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, from and after the date of this Agreement, each of Parent
and the Company shall coordinate with each other the payment of dividends with
respect to their respective common stock and the record dates and payment
dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the Parties that holders of
Parent Common Stock and the Company Common Stock shall not receive two (2)
dividends, or fail to receive one (1) dividend, for any single calendar
quarter with respect to their shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock or any shares of the Parent Common Stock that any such holder receives
in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger.

  

  

Section 6.13 Additional Parent Directors. Effective as of the Merger Effective
Time, the Parent Board of Directors shall increase the number of directors of
Parent by three (3) and, subject to the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board
of Directors, appoint Craig Bernfield and two (2) other individuals from the
Company Board designated by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent
(such persons, and any replacement designees selected pursuant to the
following sentence, the "Company Designees"). If any of such persons is not
able or willing to serve as a director of Parent as of the Merger Effective
Time, the Company Board of Directors shall select, a reasonable period of time
prior to the Merger Effective Time, a replacement reasonably acceptable to
Parent, and Parent shall, subject to approval of the Nominating Committee of
the Parent Board of Directors, appoint such replacement as a director of
Parent as of the Merger Effective Time.

Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they approve, at the

Parent, then Parent shall promptly effect the Parent Declassification Charter
Amendment.

(a) From the Closing Date and until the first anniversary thereof, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide each employee of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Employee") with employee benefits
and compensation that either are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits and compensation that are provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries or are no less favorable in
the aggregate to the employee benefits and compensation that were provided to
similarly situated employees of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries in
the calendar year before the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Parent agrees that it will cause the Surviving Entity from and after the
Merger Effective Time to honor all Company Benefit Plans; provided, however,
that nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of
Parent or the Surviving Entity to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan
or any other individual employee benefit plan, program, Contract or policy or
as requiring Parent or the Surviving Entity to offer to continue the
employment of any employee or independent contractor or, other than as
required by its terms, any written employment contract.

  

  

(c) With respect to each employee benefit plan in which a Company Employee
becomes a participant, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to (i) fully
credit each participating Company Employee for eligibility and vesting
purposes under such employee benefit plan for such Company Employee's service
with the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date;
provided, that no such service credit need be given where such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) fully credit each participating
Company Employee for any coinsurance, copayments and deductibles paid and for
amounts paid toward any out-of-pocket maximums prior to the date the Company
Employee becomes a participant in such employee benefit plan with respect to
the calendar year in which such participation commences, and (iii) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Company Employees.

  

  

(d) Parent shall pay or cause the Surviving Entity to pay each Company
Employee all annual bonuses earned by such Company Employee with respect to
the 2014 calendar year, to the extent that they have not been paid before the
Closing Date, at approximately the same date as the date that employee annual
bonuses are paid to similarly situated employees of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries, to the extent that complete financial information is available
at that date to allow the payment of annual bonuses to such Company Employees,
and if such information is not available at that date, as soon as practicable
thereafter.

(e) The Company Board of Directors shall adopt resolutions authorizing the
termination of any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code maintained by the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries (the "Company 401(k) Plan"), to be effective no later than the
day before the Closing Date and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
take any other steps necessary for the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan
to be effective no later than the day before the Closing Date. All
participants and former participants in the Company 401(k) Plan shall become
fully vested in their account balances under the Company 401(k) Plan.

  

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as an amendment or other
modification of any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or any other
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement or the establishment of any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement. Nothing herein shall be deemed
to be a guarantee of employment for any employee of the Surviving Entity or
any of its subsidiaries, or to restrict the right of the Surviving Entity,
Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries to terminate or cause to be
terminated the employment of any employee at any time for any or no reason
with or without notice Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this Section 6.14 are included for the sole benefit of
Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Company, the Company Operating Partnership
and their respective Subsidiaries, and that nothing in this Section 6.14,
whether express or implied, shall create any third-party beneficiary or other
rights (A) in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any
participant in any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof) of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (B) to continued employment
with Parent, the Company, the Surviving Entity, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or continued participation in any employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement.

  

  

Section 6.16 Partnership Combination. The Parties agree that substantially all
of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are transferred to any
of the Parent Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or as otherwise
contemplated by the terms of this Agreement shall be combined with
substantially all of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries in a manner
such that all such assets (other than Parent's direct and indirect equity
interests in Merger Sub and the Parent Partnership) are owned or held directly
or indirectly through an entity taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (the "Partnership") as of, or as soon as commercially
practical after, the Merger Effective Time (the "Partnership Combination" and
the time such Partnership Combination occurs, "Partnership Combination
Effective Time"). To effect the Partnership Combination, the Parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to identify and implement steps as may be
required to effect the Partnership Combination provided that such steps so
identified by the Parties include those actions that are required to satisfy
the following conditions: (1) actions identified by Parent's counsel as
reasonably necessary to minimize or eliminate any liability that will be due
for state or local transfers taxes that would arise as a result of any
transfer of the assets or properties of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, (2)
actions identified by Company's counsel as reasonably necessary to avoid a
termination of the Company Operating Partnership's taxable year as defined in
Code Section 708(b)(1), (3) actions identified by Parent's or Company's
counsel as reasonably necessary to permit the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (4) after the
steps so identified are fully taken, (A) each limited partner owning Company
OP Units in the Company Operating Partnership (other than the Company) will
own a number of limited partner units in the Partnership equal to the Company
OP Units held in the Company Operating Partnership at the Merger Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, (B) the terms of the operating
agreement governing the affairs of the Partnership in effect after the Merger
Effective Time will provide that such units may be redeemed and/or converted
into Parent Common Stock, and (C) the adjustment factor (as that term is
defined in such Company Operating Partnership Agreement) shall initially be
set at 1.0, (5) after the steps so identified are fully taken, Parent and/or
its Subsidiaries hold units in the Partnership equal in amount to the issued
and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock immediately after the Merger
Effective Time, and (6) the agreement in effect after the Merger Effective
Time that governs the affairs of the Partnership contains terms, conditions,
and agreements that are substantially the same as the Company Operating
Partnership Agreement currently in effect other than for changes as the
Parties may mutually agree. Following the satisfaction or irrevocable waiver
of all of the closing conditions in Article VII (other than Section 7.1(e))
and at the instant in time immediately prior to, simultaneously with, or
immediately after the Effective Time of the Merger, as the case may be, the
Parties shall effect the Partnership Combination and shall take such other
steps in connection therewith and with the Merger (including complying with
Section 11.2(c) of the Company Operating Partnership Agreement), in each case
in a manner so that no vote or consent of the limited partners of the Company
Operating Partnership is required.

Section 6.17 Parent Partnership Indebtedness. Parent and the Parent
Partnership shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent
Partnership to incur prior to or simultaneously with the Parent Partnership
Restructuring (and have outstanding as of Closing), at least $100 million of
unsecured indebtedness for borrowed money that is not guaranteed by any Person
other than Subsidiaries of the Parent Partnership (the "Parent Partnership
Debt"). Parent and the Parent Partnership will reasonably consult with the
Company with respect to the incurrence of such indebtedness. Parent and the
Parent Partnership will cause the Parent Partnership to allocate the Parent
Partnership Debt to holders of Company OP Units receiving Parent Partnership
Units in the Partnership Combination to the maximum extent possible (including
by using the optional method under Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(3)
to allocate liabilities to a partner to which "built-in gain" is allocable
with respect to section 704(c) property or property for which reverse section
704(c) allocations are applicable) to prevent any such holder from recognizing
gain for income tax purposes caused by a reduction in the tax basis of such
holders' Company OP Units or Parent Partnership Units occurring on the Closing
Date as a result of the Transactions.

  

  

Section 6.18 Payoff Letter. The Company shall deliver to Parent for the
Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries listed on Section
6.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (a) at least five (5) business days
prior to Closing (to the extent required), the consent of the Federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development to the termination of the
insurance on such Indebtedness in connection with a voluntary prepayment, with
such consent either having no expiration date or with an expiration date later
than the anticipated date of the Closing, and (b) at least five (5) business
days prior to Closing, customary payoff letters for such Indebtedness, such
that such Indebtedness may be paid in full in compliance with the loan
documents evidencing such Indebtedness and applicable HUD regulations;
provided, however, that, in lieu of the foregoing, the Company may, at any
time prior to Closing, cause such Indebtedness to be paid in full. If the
Company chooses to prepay such Indebtedness prior to Closing, the Company
shall promptly cause the holders of such Indebtedness to file an Insurance
Termination Request for Multi-Family Mortgage (HUD Form 9807) requesting such
termination in connection with the proposed voluntary prepayment.

Section 6.19 Financing.

  

  

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing in a
timely manner that would not result in a delay of the Closing pursuant to
Section 6.19(d). Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis of Parent's efforts to obtain the Financing, including the
proposed terms thereof, and will provide the Company with drafts of all
agreements to effect the Financing and offering documents with respect to the
Financing and give the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on drafts of such agreements and documents. At Closing, Parent shall use a
portion of the proceeds thereof (or other funds then available) to provide for
the satisfaction and discharge or covenant defeasance under the indentures
governing the Company Operating Partnership's outstanding Indebtedness under
its 6.0% Senior Notes due 2021 and its 7 ¾ Senior Notes due 2019 (the
"Notes").

  

  

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best
efforts to provide reasonable cooperation to Parent in connection with
Parent's efforts to obtain the Financing, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) participate in a reasonable number of presentations to
potential Financing sources, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions
with rating agencies relating to the Financing (provided that reasonable
notice is provided to the Company in advance of those meetings), (ii)
assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,
offering documents, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents required in connection with the Financing, (iii) furnishing Parent
and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including all
financial statements and financial data of the type required by Regulation S-X
and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of type and form customarily
included in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act to
consummate the offerings of debt securities contemplated by the Financing,
(iv) obtain accountants' consents and comfort letters (it being understood and
agreed that any and all legal opinions (other than legal opinions relating to
the formation, good standing and existence of the Company Subsidiaries) will
be provided by Parent's counsel and not the Company's counsel), (v)
cooperating with Parent in obtaining purchase accounting appraisals of each of
the Company Properties and (vi) cooperating with Parent in connection with the
satisfaction and discharge, or covenant defeasance of, the Notes. The Company
hereby consents to the use of its logo in connection with the Financing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
not be required to (A) take any action that would unreasonably interfere with
the operation of its business or (B) execute any documents prior to Closing
relating to the Financing or adopt any resolutions relating to the Financing
(other than documents to provide notice of the defeasance or redemption of the
Notes that are not effective or delivered until the Closing); provided,
however, this sentence shall not limit the covenants of the Company to use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Parent in connection with the
Partnership Combination and satisfaction and discharge of, or covenant
defeasance under, the Notes. Parent will promptly reimburse the Company and
Company Subsidiaries for any expenses incurred by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in cooperating with Parent on the Financing and shall indemnify the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any losses suffered by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary arising out of or incurred in connection with the
Financing (other than for losses to the extent arising out of information
furnished by the Company in writing for use in the Financing that was used in
a manner consistent with the manner instructed by the Company). The Company
shall indemnify Parent and Parent Subsidiaries for any losses suffered by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary arising out of or incurred in connection with
the information provided by the Company in writing for use in the Financing
that was used in a manner consistent with the manner instructed by the
Company.

(c) Parent shall select lead underwriters, bookrunners or placement agents of
nationally recognized expertise for any Financing. If Parent has not obtained
the Financing prior to the date fifteen (15) business days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, then prior to commencing any offering of any
securities in a Financing, Parent shall notify the Company of the anticipated
pricing terms (the "Indicative Pricing Terms") and the proposed lead
underwriters, bookrunners or placement agents thereof. If the Company does not
timely deliver a Financing Objection to Parent, Parent may complete the
Financing on terms that are not less favorable in any material respect than
the terms set forth in the Indicative Pricing Terms, and the Parties expressly
acknowledge and agree that the Effects of the Indicative Pricing Terms of such
Financing shall not be deemed to cause or contribute to a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant of Parent, or to a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. If either Parent or the Company notifies the other within three (3)
business days after the delivery of the Indicative Pricing Terms that it has
determined in its reasonable good faith judgment that the completion of a
Financing on the Indicative Pricing Terms would have a Combined Company
Material Adverse Effect (a "Financing Objection"), then Parent shall not
complete the Financing on the Indicative Pricing Terms without the prior
written consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). If neither the Parent nor the Company deliver a
Financing Objection to Parent within such three (3) business day period,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete the Financing as
promptly as reasonably practicable on terms that are not less favorable in any
material respect than the terms set forth in the Indicative Pricing Terms.
From and after the delivery of a Financing Objection by either Party through
the termination of this Agreement or the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall
continue to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing in a
timely manner that would not result in a delay of the Closing pursuant to
Section 6.19(d) to the extent reasonably possible, and otherwise continue to
comply with its obligations pursuant to Section 6.19(a). If (i) in the
reasonable good faith judgment of either Parent or the Company, the
consummation of the Financing on the then proposed Indicative Pricing Terms
would have a Combined Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) Parent and the
Company do not agree as of the date the Closing would otherwise occur as to
whether the consummation of the Financing on the then proposed Indicative
Pricing Terms would have a Combined Company Material Adverse Effect (a "CCMAE
Financing"), then either party shall be entitled to seek a declaratory
judgment from a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in the State
of Maryland on an expedited basis as to whether the consummation of the
Financing on the latest proposed Indicative Pricing Terms would have a
Combined Company Material Adverse Effect. In the case of a CCMAE Financing,
the Financing and the Merger shall not be consummated and the Closing shall
not occur unless and until the earlier of (A) the date agreed upon by the
Company and Parent in writing, (B) the date ten (10) business days after a
judgment by such court that the consummation of the Financing on the proposed
Indicative Pricing Terms would not have a Combined Company Material Adverse
Effect and (C) the date set by such court.

  

   

83 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(d) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, if as of the date the Closing
would otherwise occur the consummation of the Financing on the then proposed
Indicative Pricing Terms would result in a Combined Company Material Adverse
Effect, the Closing shall not take place until three (3) business days after
the proposed Indicative Pricing Terms for the Financing have been improved so
that the consummation of the Financing on such improved proposed Indicative
Pricing Terms would not have a Combined Company Material Adverse Effect. If
the effect of this Section 6.19(d) would be to delay the Closing beyond the
initial Outside Date, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended to
August 31, 2015.

  

  

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) completion of the Financing is
not a condition to any Party's obligation to consummate the Merger and (ii) if
Sections 6.19(c) and 6.19(d) operate to extend the Closing beyond the initial
Outside Date and a Party terminates the Agreement pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 8.1(d), the termination of this Agreement and the fact
that the Closing did not occur shall not in and of themselves be deemed to
mean any Party has breached its obligations under this Agreement.

(c) In the event that:

  

  

(i) (A) a Parent Acquisition Transaction with respect to Parent shall have
been publicly made, proposed or communicated on terms that do not expressly

a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Parent Acquisition
Transaction; or

Parent Acquisition Transaction, or if earlier, the consummation of a Parent
Acquisition Transaction; it being understood that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Termination Payment on more than one occasion.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if a Party
provides a notice of termination and such termination could result in the
obligation to pay the Termination Payment, the right to receive such
Termination Payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent
Related Parties or Company Related Parties, as applicable, against the Company
Related Parties or Parent Related Parties, as applicable, for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise; provided, that the
foregoing shall not impair the rights of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, if
any, to obtain injunctive relief and/or specific performance pursuant to
Section 9.14 prior to any termination of this Agreement. Upon payment of the
Termination Payment, none of the Company or Parent, as applicable, nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any of the Company Related Parties or Parent
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except with respect to any
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
if a Party has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to multiple
provisions of this Agreement, such Party may elect under which provision it is
providing notice of termination.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

  

  

(i) If a Party is required to pay a Termination Payment, such payment shall be
paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to be paid pursuant to
this Agreement by wire transfer of same day funds to an escrow account
designated in accordance with this Section 8.2(e), and the amount payable in
any taxable year of the recipient shall not exceed the lesser of (A) such
Termination Payment, and (B) the maximum amount that can be paid to the
recipient without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant taxable year, determined as if
(x) the payment is not considered income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or
856(c)(3) of the Code ("Qualifying Income") and (y) the recipient has other
income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to 1% of its
gross income that is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as
determined by the recipient independent accountants; provided, however, that
in the event the recipient receives either (I) a letter from its counsel
indicating that the recipient has received a ruling from the IRS as described
below in Section 8.2(e)(ii) or (II) an opinion from the recipient outside
counsel as described below in Section 8.2(e)(ii), the amount of such
Termination Payment payable shall be the amount determined under clause (A)
above.

  

  

(ii) To secure the Company's or Parent's obligation to pay these amounts, as
applicable, such Party shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to
such Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by it on such terms
(subject to this Section 8.2(e)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of
such Termination Payment pursuant to this Section 8.2(e) shall be made at the
time the Company or Parent, as applicable, is obligated to pay such amount
pursuant to this Section 8.2 by wire transfer of same day funds. The escrow
agreement shall provide that such Termination Payment in escrow or any portion
thereof shall not be released to the recipient unless the escrow agent
receives any one or combination of the following: (A) a letter from the
recipient's independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be
paid by the escrow agent to the recipient without causing it to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the
recipient has other income from unknown sources during such year in an amount
equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to
any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case
the escrow agent shall release such amount set forth in the independent
accountants' letter to the recipient, or (B) a letter from the recipient's
counsel indicating that (1) the recipient received a ruling from the IRS
holding that the receipt by the recipient of such Termination Payment would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (2) the
recipient's outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that
the receipt by the recipient of such Termination Payment should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the
escrow agent shall release the entire amount of the Termination Payment to the
recipient. The Parties agree to amend this Section 8.2(e) at the reasonable
request of the recipient in order to (x) maximize the portion of such
Termination Payment that may be distributed to it hereunder without causing it
to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or
(y) assist it in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from its
outside counsel, in each case, as described in this Section 8.2(e). Any amount
of such Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable
year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year,
subject to the foregoing limitations of this Section 8.2(e).

(f) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.2 are an integral part of the Transactions and that the Termination
Payment is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the recipient and the Company Operating
Partnership or Merger Sub, as applicable, in the circumstances in which the
Termination Payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

Section 9.7 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation" except when preceded by a negative predicate. As used in
this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The table of contents and headings set forth in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not
affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any term or provision hereof. When reference is made herein to a
Person, such reference shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires. All references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person
shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person
unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. The Parties
agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor Laws. References to a Person are also to
its successors and permitted assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$" refer
to currency of the United States of America (unless otherwise expressly
provided herein).

  

  

Section 9.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission or
by e-mail of a .pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.9 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries.

  

  

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended so that until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, Parent and
Merger Sub shall be permitted to take the actions contemplated by this
Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any
of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

  

(b) Except (i) as provided in Section 6.4 and (ii) the right of the former
holders of Company Common Stock to receive, from and after the Merger
Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.2, neither this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter) nor the Confidentiality Agreement are intended to
confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies
hereunder.

Section 9.10 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Merger are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.11 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at law, in
equity, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Maryland without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles
(whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Maryland).

  

  

(b) All Legal Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall
be heard and determined exclusively in any Maryland state or federal court.
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Maryland state or federal court, for the purpose
of any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
Transaction brought by any Party, (ii) agrees not to commence any such Legal
Proceeding except in such courts, (iii) agrees that any claim in respect of
any such Legal Proceedings may be heard and determined in any Maryland state
or federal court, (iv) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such Legal Proceeding, and (v) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such Legal Proceeding. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such Legal Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in Section 9.4. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the
right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

  

Section 9.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
MERGER AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.12.

Section 9.13 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except that (a) Merger Sub may assign, in its
sole discretion and without the consent of any other Party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) Parent and one
or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii) one
or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent and (b) Parent
and Merger Sub may assign, in their sole discretion and without the consent of
any other Party, any or all of their rights, interests and obligations
hereunder to any of their lenders or other financing sources from time to time
as collateral security. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without
relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

Section 9.14 Enforcement; Remedies.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

  

  

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Except as set forth in this
Section 9.14, including the limitations set forth in Section 9.14(c), it is
agreed that in the event of a breach prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any
other Party and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding Section 9.14(b), it is acknowledged and agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance of Parent's obligation
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to consummate the Merger only in the
event that each of the following conditions have been satisfied: (i) all of
the conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or
the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by a material breach by Parent
or Merger Sub of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement) and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to
complete the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding Section 9.14(b), it is acknowledged and agreed that Parent
shall be entitled to specific performance of the Company's obligation pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement to consummate the Merger only in the event that
each of the following conditions have been satisfied: (i) all of the
conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or
the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by a material breach by the
Company of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement) and (ii) the Company has failed to complete the Closing in
accordance with Section 1.2.

(e) The Parties' right to obtain specific performance is an integral part of
the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to the grant of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
of this Agreement by any other Party (including any objection on the basis
that there is an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity), and
each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in
accordance with the terms of this Section 9.14. In the event any Party seeks
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such Party
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
such order or injunction all in accordance with the terms of this Section
9.14.
