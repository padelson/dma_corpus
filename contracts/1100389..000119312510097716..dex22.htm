other Person that restricts or prohibits (or, if successful, would restrict
or prohibit) the exercise by Parent of its rights under this Agreement or the
performance by any party of its obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 2.08. _Reliance._ Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that

Section 5.01 _. No Proxies for or Encumbrances on Shares_. Except pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, such Stockholder shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, directly or indirectly, (i) grant any proxies or
powers of attorney or enter into any voting trust or other agreement or
arrangement with respect to the voting of any Covered Shares, (ii) sell
(constructively or otherwise), assign, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose
of, or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding
with respect to the direct or indirect sale, assignment, transfer,
encumbrance or other disposition of, any Covered Shares or Warrants or
beneficial ownership thereof or therein during the term of this Agreement, or
(iii) knowingly take any action that would make any representation or warranty
of such Stockholder contained in Section 2.01, 2.02, 2.03, 2.04 or 2.06
hereof untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing or disabling such
Stockholder from performing its obligations under this Agreement. Such
Stockholder shall not seek or solicit any such sale, assignment, transfer,
encumbrance or other disposition or any such contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding and agrees to notify Parent promptly if such
Stockholder shall be approached or solicited, directly or indirectly, by any
Person with respect to any of the foregoing and provide the details of such
approach or solicitation to the extent requested by Parent.

 

Section 5.02 _. Other Offers_. Such Stockholder shall not, nor shall such
Stockholder authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or

Proposal, or any inquiry or the making of any proposal that could reasonably
be expected to lead to the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or (2) enter
into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish
any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford

any of its Subsidiaries to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any
Third Party that has made, or to the knowledge of such Stockholder, is seeking
to make, an Acquisition Proposal, except that to the extent the Company
exercises its rights under and in accordance with Section 6.03(b)(i) of the
Merger Agreement (and the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a breach by such Stockholder of this Section 5.02) (a "Fiduciary
Exercise") with respect to any Third Party or its Representatives or
financing sources (a



 

6  "Permitted Party"), the foregoing clause (ii) shall not apply with respect
to discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing of information or affording
access to, or cooperating with, the Permitted Party to the extent related to
or arising from the Fiduciary Exercise. Such Stockholder will promptly notify
Parent after receipt of (i) an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in each case in clause (ii) by any Person that has made, or to
the knowledge of Stockholders, is seeking to make, an Acquisition Proposal
and will keep Parent fully informed of the status and details of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. Nothing in this Section 5.02

if such Stockholder attempts to (i) transfer, vote or provide any other

the Warrants, in each case other than in compliance with this Agreement, the
Company shall not, and such Stockholder hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably instructs the Company to not, (a) permit any such transfer on its
books and records, (b) issue a new certificate representing any of the Shares
or (c) record any such vote, in each case unless and until such Stockholder
shall have complied with the terms of this Agreement. If so requested by
Parent, such Stockholder agrees that the certificates representing the Covered
Shares and the Warrant shall bear a legend stating that they are subject to
this Agreement.

Effective Time. Each Stockholder shall also have the right to terminate this
Agreement at any time by written notice to Parent if any of the terms of the

additional condition to the obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to

the Shares or the Warrants pursuant to the Merger Agreement in a manner
adverse to such Stockholder (for the avoidance of doubt, (x) a decrease in

stockholder of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the provisions

any liability incurred by any party hereto as a result of a breach of a term

delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto.

Section 6.09 _. No Waiver_. No failure or delay by any party hereto in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

 

Section 6.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the

proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby

or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or,
if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 

Section 6.13 _. Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).
