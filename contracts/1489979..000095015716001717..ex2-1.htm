interest;

  


 

  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be governed by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and,

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that the

and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger Transactions,
(iii) declared this Agreement and the Merger Transactions advisable and (iv)

WHEREAS, Parent, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will
approve and adopt this Agreement by written consent immediately following its

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby agree as follows:

  


 

  


 

  

ARTICLE I

  


 

  

 _The Transactions_

  


 

  

SECTION 1.01. _The Offer._ (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article VII, by the later of (i) ten
business days after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the date on which the
Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year with the
SEC (as defined below), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the
Offer.

  


 

  

(b) In accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and subject
only to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the "
_Offer Conditions_ ") and, for the avoidance of doubt, no other conditions,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), at or as promptly as
practicable following the Expiration Time, irrevocably accept for payment (the
time of acceptance for payment, the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ ") and, at or as
promptly as practicable following the Offer Acceptance Time (but in any event
within three business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under
the Exchange Act) thereafter) pay for all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, at the Offer Acceptance
Time and on a timely basis at all times thereafter, the funds necessary to
purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated
to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

  


 

  

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement and
subject only to the Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Merger
Sub expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive
any Offer Condition other than the Minimum Condition and (iii) make any other
changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise
expressly provided by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to, (A)
decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock
sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose any conditions to the Offer
other than the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or supplement any of the
Offer Conditions (i) in a manner that adversely affects the holders of Company
Common Stock or that makes such Offer Condition more difficult to satisfy or
(ii) in any other circumstance, without the consent of the Company,

  


 

  


 

  

 

2  

  


 

  


 

  

not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, (F) amend, modify or
waive the Minimum Condition, (G) except as otherwise required or expressly
permitted by Section 1.01(e), extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time,
(H) provide for any "subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act or (I) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any
of the other terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of
Company Common Stock. The Offer may not be terminated prior to its scheduled
Expiration Time, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Article VII.

  


 

  

(d) The Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) (i.e., one minute
after 11:59 p.m. New York City time) on the date that is 20 business days
(calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)
following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) of the Offer (such initial expiration date and time of the
Offer, the " _Initial Expiration Time_ ") or, if the Offer has been extended
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.01(e), the date and time to which
the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later
expiration date and time to which the Offer has been so extended, the "
_Expiration Time_ ").

  


 

  

(e) Subject to the parties' respective rights to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to Article VII, the Offer may or shall, as applicable, be extended
from time to time as follows:

  


 

  

(i) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any of the Offer Conditions has
not been satisfied or waived by Parent and Merger Sub (to the extent such
waiver is permitted under this Agreement and applicable Law), then Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more
occasions in consecutive increments of five business days each (each such
increment to end at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last business day of
such increment) (or such other duration as may be agreed to by Parent and the
Company) in order to permit the satisfaction of such Offer Condition(s);
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) Merger Sub shall not be required to extend
the Offer to a date later than the Outside Date (for the avoidance of doubt,
as the Outside Date may be extended pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) and (B) if
the Marketing Period has ended and the sole then-unsatisfied Offer Condition
is the Minimum Condition, (1) Merger Sub may (but shall not be required to)
extend the Offer on up to two occasions in consecutive increments of five
business days each (each such increment to end at 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the last business day of such increment) (or such other duration as
may be agreed to by Parent and the Company) and (2) except as provided in
clause (1) of this Section 1.01(e)(i), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer if the Company shall have requested in
writing that Merger Sub so extend the Offer;

  


 

  

(ii) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by
applicable Law, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or The
NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ") or its staff;

  


 

  

(iii) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, the Company brings or shall
have brought any action in accordance with Section 8.08 to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by
Parent or Merger Sub, the Expiration Time shall be extended (A) for the period
during which such action is pending or (B) by

  


 

  


 

  

 

3  

  


 

  


 

  

such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, as
the case may be, but, in any event, not past the Outside Date (for the
avoidance of doubt, as the Outside Date may be extended pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(i)); and

  


 

  

(iv) if , at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, (A) the full amount of the
Debt Financing has not been funded and will not be available to be funded at
the Offer Closing and the Closing (other than as a result of a breach by
Parent or Merger Sub of any of their representations, warranties or covenants
set forth in Sections 4.05 and 5.04 of this Agreement) and (B) Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree in writing that (1) the Company may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(iii) and receive the Parent
Termination Fee and (2) all Offer Conditions set forth in paragraphs (d), (e),
(f) and (h) of Annex I will be deemed to have been satisfied or waived at the
Expiration Time of the Offer after giving effect to any extension pursuant to
this clause (iv), Merger Sub shall have the right in its sole discretion to
extend the Offer on up to four occasions in consecutive increments of five
business days each (each such increment to end at 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the last business day of such increment) (or such other duration as
may be agreed to by Parent and the Company); _provided_ that Merger Sub shall
not be permitted to extend the Offer to a date later than the Outside Date
(for the avoidance of doubt, as the Outside Date may be extended pursuant to
Section 7.01(b)(i)).

  


 

  

Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, extend the
Offer in any manner except as required or expressly permitted pursuant to this
Section 1.01(e).

  


 

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, as a result of the extension
of the Offer in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.01(e), the
Expiration Time would occur on the date that is the Outside Date, the
Expiration Time shall instead occur at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
business day immediately preceding the Outside Date.

  


 

  

(f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and at or prior
to the Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall
provide to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

  


 

  

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article
VII, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within one business day of such termination)
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, and shall not acquire any
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub to return, in accordance

ARTICLE II

  


 

  

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates;_

  

 _Equity-Based Awards_

  


 

  

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(b) _Cancelation of Certain Shares._ All shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Company
Common Stock that were accepted for payment by Merger Sub in the Offer shall
be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than (i) Company Restricted Shares to be treated
in accordance with Section 2.03, (ii) Appraisal Shares to be treated in
accordance with Section 2.06 and (iii) shares of Company Common Stock to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Offer Price,
net to the seller in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") or non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock held in
book entry form (each, a " _Book Entry Share_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.02(b).

  


 

  

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares._

  


 

  

(a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Article II and, in connection therewith, prior to the Closing Date
shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash
sufficient to pay the

  


 

  


 

  

 

8  

  


 

  


 

  

aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending its disbursement in accordance with this Section
2.02, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and
interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by
either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Services
or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or restore
the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all
payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No investment losses
resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall
diminish the rights of any holder of shares of Company Common Stock to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

  


 

  

(b) _Payment Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three business days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, at
the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock (other than the
Company Common Stock to be canceled or converted in accordance with Section
2.01(b)) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book Entry
Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other
customary provisions (including customary provisions regarding delivery of an
"agent's message" with respect to Book Entry Shares) as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c). Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book Entry Share for cancelation
to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with such letter's instructions (and such
other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent),
the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book Entry
Share, and the Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book Entry
Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (A) the
Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share surrendered and
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate and Book
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Article II.

  


 

  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock._ The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender

  


 

  


 

  

 

9  

  


 

  


 

  

for exchange of Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with the terms
of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and at the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that represented ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock and Book Entry Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(e), if, at any time after the
Effective Time, Certificates and Book Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

  


 

  

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated
by this Article II.

  


 

  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) which has not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment
of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(f) _No Liability._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  


 

  

(g) _Withholding Taxes._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and (if required)
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  


 

  


 

  

 

10  

  


 

  


 

  

SECTION 2.03. _Equity-Based Awards._ Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions as may be required to provide that:

  


 

  

(a) each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company
Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall, as of the Effective Time,
be canceled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive
solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option has not
been exercised and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option (and for the
avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option that has an exercise price that
is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time for no consideration or payment);

  


 

  

(b) each share of Company Common Stock subject to forfeiture conditions (each,
a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Merger Consideration;

  


 

  

(c) each restricted stock unit (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and the holder
thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of
the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger
Consideration;

  


 

  

(d) each deferred stock unit (each, a " _Company DSU_ ") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and the holder
thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of
the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company DSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger
Consideration;

  


 

  

(e) each PSU Award granted in calendar year 2016 that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _New PSU Award_ ") shall be
canceled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely,
in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a
lump-sum cash payment equal to the greater of (i) the product of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the New PSU Award at the
"target amount" as set forth in the applicable award agreement and (B) the
Merger Consideration or (ii) the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock, if any, that would be earned under the New PSU Award
based on the financial results for the fiscal quarters completed prior to the
Effective Time, as measured against the performance goals set forth in the
applicable award agreement, which performance goals shall be prorated for the
period from the beginning of the applicable performance period through the
last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and (B) the Merger
Consideration; and

  


 

  


 

  

 

11  

  


 

  


 

  

(f) each PSU Award that is not a New PSU Award and that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Non-New PSU Award_ ")
shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive
solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock, if any, that would be earned under the Non-New
PSU Award based on the financial results for the fiscal quarters completed
prior to the Effective Time, as measured against the performance goals set
forth in the applicable award agreement, which performance goals shall be
prorated for the period from the beginning of the applicable performance
period through the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and
(ii) the Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.04. _Payments with Respect to Equity-Based Awards._ Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in any event, no later than the first payroll date
after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay through its
payroll systems (or through an alternative method) the amounts due pursuant to
Section 2.03; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any such amounts
that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the
Code, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts at the earliest time
permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement
that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.05. _Adjustments._ Without duplication of any adjustment made
pursuant to Section 1.01(f), if between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
the occurrence or record date of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change, the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change. For the avoidance of doubt, the Merger
Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.05, shall equal the
Offer Price, as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.01(f).

  


 

  

SECTION 2.06. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Appraisal
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead shall be canceled
and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided under
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Person
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such Person to
receive those rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and shall represent only the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), without interest thereon. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate

  


 

  


 

  

 

12

with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with
the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to make any

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as
(A) set forth in the confidential disclosure letter delivered by the Company
to Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood that any information, item
or matter set forth on one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to, and shall be deemed to
apply to and qualify, the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent based on the content and context
of such disclosure that such information, item or matter is relevant to such
other section or subsection) or (B) disclosed in any report, schedule, form,
statement or other document (including exhibits) filed with, or furnished to,
the SEC and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Filed SEC Documents_ "), other than any disclosures (other than statements of
historical fact) in any such Filed SEC Document contained in the (i) "Risk
Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" section thereof and (ii) any other
section relating to forward-looking statements to the extent they are
generally cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature, it being
understood that any matter disclosed in such filings shall not be deemed
disclosed for the purposes of Section 3.01, Section 3.02 and Section 3.03 of
this Agreement:

  


 

  

SECTION 3.01. _Organization; Standing._

  


 

  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, is in good standing with the Secretary of State
and has all requisite corporate power and corporate authority necessary to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except (other than with
respect to the Company's due organization and valid existence) as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and
is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the

in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) under

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business and
is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by them or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by them

required to be filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents that

with respect to the portions that are amended (in the case of all other
Company SEC Documents), the Company SEC Documents complied as to form in all

the Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates (or, if amended prior to
the date of this Agreement, the date of the filing of such amendment, with
respect to the disclosures that are amended) contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were

Company SEC Documents, as of

  


 

  


 

  

 

17  

  


 

  


 

  

their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if such Company SEC

filing of such amendment, with respect to the consolidated financial
statements that are amended or restated therein), complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with

a consistent basis during the periods involved (except (i) as may be indicated
in the notes thereto or (ii) as permitted by Regulation S-X) and fairly

methods or principles that would be required to be disclosed in the Company's
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, except as described in the notes
thereto.

  


 

  

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be
required under GAAP, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company (including the notes
thereto) except liabilities (i) reflected or reserved against in the
consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the Company as of October

(iii) as contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise incurred in connection
with the Transactions, (iv) that have been discharged or paid prior to the

party to, any "off balance sheet arrangement" within the meaning of Item 303
of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.

  


 

  

(d) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as such
terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company and its Subsidiaries is
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and
that all such information is communicated to the individuals responsible for
the preparation of the Company's filings with the SEC to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Since the Applicable Date, neither
the Company nor, to the Company's Knowledge, the Company's independent
registered public accounting firm, has identified or been made aware of (A)
any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data or (B) any fraud or
allegation of fraud, whether or not material, that involves (or involved) the
management of the Company or other employees who have (or had) a significant
role in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

(e) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents
(including any amendments or supplements thereto) will, at the time such Offer
Documents are filed with the SEC or at the time such Offer Documents are first
published, sent or given to the stockholders of the Company, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto)
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and will not, at the time it is filed with the SEC and at the
time first published, sent or given to the stockholders of the Company,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub or any Affiliates thereof for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D‑9.

date of this Agreement, neither of the Financing Letters has been amended or
modified, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such amendment or modification
is contemplated, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, none of the respective
obligations and commitments contained in such letters have been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated. Parent or Merger
Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection
with the Financing Letters that are payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement and will continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be
paid pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters as and when they become
due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date. Assuming (i) the Financing is
funded in accordance with the Financing Letters, (ii) the accuracy in all
material respects of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
3.02, 3.05(b) and (c), 3.06(b) (as it relates to Section 5.01(b)(i)) and
3.16(a)(ii) and (iii) the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of
the covenants and agreements contained in Sections 5.01(b)(i) and 5.01(b)(ii)
of this Agreement, the net proceeds contemplated by the Financing Letters
(after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and
similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of
flex (including original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt
Commitment Letter), will in the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Offer Price and Merger
Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this
Agreement, the Equity Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter) and any
other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions (including all amounts payable in respect of Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company RSUs, Company DSUs and PSU Awards
under this Agreement) and to pay all related fees and expenses payable by them
in connection with the Transactions (such amount, the " _Required Amount_ ").
The Financing Letters are (x) legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the
other parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms against Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in each case except as such
enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and

  


 

  


 

  

 

31  

  


 

  


 

  

Equity Exception and (z) as of the date of this Agreement, in full force and
effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto under the Equity Funding Letter
or the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent does not have any
reason to believe that the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing
Letters will not be satisfied or that the Required Amount will not be
available on the Closing Date. The only conditions precedent (including the
market "flex" provisions) related to the obligations of the Guarantors to fund
the full amount of the Equity Financing and the lenders to fund the full
amount of the Debt Financing are those expressly set forth in the Equity
Funding Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements
(except for the portions of the Redacted Fee Letter permitted to be redacted
hereunder) to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the
Financing other than as expressly contained in the Financing Letters delivered
to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement that would (A) impair the
enforceability of any of the Financing Letters, (B) reduce the aggregate
amount of any portion of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount as compared to the fees and
original issue discount contemplated by the Financing Letters on the date of
this Agreement) such that the aggregate amount of the Financing would be below
the amount required to pay the Required Amount, (C) impose new or additional
conditions precedent to the Financing, (D) otherwise adversely modify any of
the conditions precedent to the Financing or (E) reasonably be expected to
prevent, impair or materially delay the consummation of the Financing.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.06. _Limited Guarantee._ Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed limited
guarantee of the Guarantors, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor
of the Company in respect of Parent's obligation to pay the Parent Termination
Fee and the other obligations specified therein, up to the aggregate amount
set forth therein (the " _Limited Guarantee_ "). The Limited Guarantee is (a)
a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors, (b) enforceable
against the Guarantors in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and (c)
in full force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the
Guarantors under the Limited Guarantee.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.07. _Solvency._ None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors is
entering into this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent's
and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger, the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Article III hereof, and after giving effect to the Transactions and the
payment of the aggregate Offer Price and Merger Consideration, any other
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the
Financing Letters and payment of the Required Amount, the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent as of the Offer Acceptance Time and as of the
Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the applicable
Transactions. For the purposes of this

  


 

  


 

  

 

32  

  


 

  


 

  

Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ", when used with respect to any Person, means
that, as of any date of determination, (a) the fair value of the assets of
such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, at a fair valuation,
will exceed the debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b)
the present fair saleable value of the property of such Person and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be greater than the amount that will
be required to pay the probable liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis on their debts and other liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities
become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will not have unreasonably small capital with which to
conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as such businesses are now
conducted and are proposed to be conducted following the Closing Date and (d)
such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be able to pay
their debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as
such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.08. _Certain Arrangements._ (1) As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no and (2) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
other than the Rollover Agreement and the Support Agreement (if any), there
will be no Contracts or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or
written and whether or not legally binding) or commitments to enter into
Contracts or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written and
whether or not legally binding) (a) between Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors
or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Company's
management or Board of Directors or any beneficial owner of Company Common
Stock, on the other hand, that relate in any way to the Company or any of its
businesses or Subsidiaries (including those businesses and Subsidiaries
following the Closing) or the Transactions (including as to continuing
employment or equity roll-over) or (b) pursuant to which any stockholder of
the Company would be entitled to receive value or consideration of a different
amount or nature than the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration or pursuant
to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to tender any shares of Company
Common Stock in the Offer or agrees to vote against or otherwise oppose any
Superior Proposal. Parent and Merger Sub will provide to the Company drafts
(reasonably in advance of execution) and thereafter complete, correct and
executed copies of Rollover Agreement and the Shareholder Agreement (if any).
Parent and Merger Sub shall not amend, supplement or otherwise modify the
Rollover Agreement or the Support Agreement (if any) in any manner that may be
materially adverse to the Company or that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impair or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.09. _Brokers and Other Advisors._ No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's,
financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement
of expenses in connection therewith, in connection with the Transactions based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, except for Persons, if any, whose fees and expenses
will be paid by Parent.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.10. _No Other Company Representations or Warranties._ Parent and
Merger Sub each acknowledges that it and its Representatives have received
access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, Contracts and other
assets of the Company which it and

  


 

  


 

  

 

33  

  


 

  


 

  

its Representatives have desired or requested to review, and that it and its
Representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company and to discuss the business and assets of the Company. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III, Parent and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any other Person, (a) has made or is making any other
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including
with respect to any oral, written, video, electronic or other information
provided or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives or any oral, written, video, electronic or other information
developed by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives or
(b) will have been or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation to Parent or Merger Sub resulting from the delivery, dissemination
or any other distribution to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives (in any form whatsoever and through any medium whatsoever), or
the use by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives, of
any information, documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or other
forward-looking information, business plans or other material developed by or
provided or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives, including in due diligence materials, "data rooms" or
management presentations (formal or informal, in person, by phone, through
video or in any other format), in anticipation or contemplation of any of the
Transactions. Parent, on behalf of itself and on behalf of its Affiliates,
expressly waives any such claim relating to the foregoing matters. Parent and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates
and Representatives) that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own
independent investigation of the business, operations, assets and financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making its determination
to proceed with the Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives have relied on the representations
and warranties expressly set forth in Article III and on the results of their
own independent investigation.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.11. _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts,
Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans._ In connection with the due
diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and
Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as certain business and strategic plan information, regarding the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations. Parent
and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements, as well as in such business and strategic plans, with
which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are
taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans), and that Parent and
Merger Sub have not relied on such information and will have no claim against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, with respect thereto or, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in Article III, any rights hereunder with
respect thereto.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.12. _Information Supplied; Offer Documents._ None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion or

  


 

  


 

  

 

34  

  


 

  


 

  

incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) will, at the time the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC or at the time the Schedule 14D-9
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first published, sent or given to
the stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Offer Documents (including any
amendment or supplement thereto) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and will not, at the time
filed with the SEC and at the time first published, sent or given to the
stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company or any Affiliates thereof for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Offer Documents.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.13. _Legal Proceedings._ Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, to
the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, as of the date of this Agreement,
there is no (a) pending or threatened Action against Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates or (b) Judgment imposed upon or affecting
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, in each case, by
or before any Governmental Authority.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.14. _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" is, or has been at any
time during the last three years, an "interested stockholder" of the Company
(in each case, as such quoted terms are defined under Section 203 of the
DGCL). Neither Parent nor Merger Sub own any shares of Company Common Stock.

SECTION 5.02. _Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_. (a) Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, during the period
beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until midnight, New
York City time, on April 2, 2016 (i.e., one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York
City time, on April 1, 2016) (the " _Go-Shop Period_ "), the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall have the right to
directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate and encourage,
whether publicly or otherwise, Takeover Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or
offers or other efforts or attempts that may reasonably be expected to lead to
a Takeover Proposal), including by way of providing access to non-public
information pursuant to one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements;
_provided_ that the Company (A) shall concurrently provide to Parent, or give

efforts, attempts, discussions or negotiations. For purposes of clarity, the
Company's obligations under Section 5.02(b) shall commence with respect to
each Person upon the expiration of the Go-Shop Period unless the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee or subcommittee thereof has made the
determination referred to in Section 5.02(c)(ii) with respect to a Takeover
Proposal submitted by such Person prior to the expiration of the Go-Shop
Period and reaffirmed such determination during the period between the

referred to in Section 5.02(c)(ii) prior to the expiration of the Go-Shop
Period and reaffirmed such determination during the period between the

then be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal and request that such
Persons deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of, studies based upon
and any extracts or summaries from, any non-public information of the Company
in such Person's possession or control, which non-public information was
provided by or on behalf of the Company in connection with a Takeover Proposal
on or prior to the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, and (ii) until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VII, not, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit, or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information)
the submission of any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover
Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any non-public

Proposal or (C) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,

foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions in this Section
5.02 applicable to the Company by any of the Company's controlled Affiliates
or any of its other Representatives, to the extent acting on its behalf or at
its direction, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.02 by the
Company.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5.02(b) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time after the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company or any of its Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal, which
Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of this Section 5.02, (i) the
Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons
making the Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof or to request that any Takeover Proposal made orally be made in
writing and (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the
Company and any of its Representatives may (A) enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making the
Takeover Proposal and furnish pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made
such Takeover Proposal and its or their respective Representatives; _provided_
that the Company (1) shall concurrently provide to Parent, or give Parent
access to, any material non-public information concerning the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that is provided to, or for which access is provided to,
any such Person which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives and (2) shall not provide to any such Person any non-public

Affiliates or Representatives except as required by Law and (B) engage in or
otherwise

  


 

  


 

  

 

40  

  


 

  


 

  

participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons
making such Takeover Proposal and its or their Representatives.

  


 

  

(d) At any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal (but
in any event within one business day after Knowledge of the Company of the
receipt of such Takeover Proposal) and shall disclose to Parent the material
terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including a copy thereof
and any financing commitment papers submitted therewith, if such Takeover
Proposal is in writing) and the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such Takeover Proposal, and the Company shall keep Parent informed on a
reasonably prompt basis of any material developments with respect to any such
Takeover Proposal (including any material changes thereto) (and the Company
shall as promptly as practicable after Knowledge of the Company of the receipt
thereof provide Parent with copies of any material written materials relating
to such Takeover Proposal or any material change to the financial or other
material terms and conditions thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, all
information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.02(d) will be
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  


 

  

(e) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof or
subcommittee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), the Company Board Recommendation, (B) recommend the approval or
adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or
adopt, any Takeover Proposal or (C) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or, if any Takeover Proposal has been
made public, fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation upon request of
Parent within the earlier of three business days prior to the then scheduled
Expiration Date or 10 business days after Parent requests such reaffirmation
with respect to such Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
may make such request only once with respect to such Takeover Proposal unless
such Takeover Proposal is subsequently publicly modified in any material
respect in which case Parent may make such request once each time such
modification is made) (any action described in this clause (i) being referred
to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) execute or enter into
(or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into) any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
in connection with a Takeover Proposal, other than any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, but not after, the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or subcommittee thereof may
(I) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (II) cause the Company to enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal not
solicited in violation of this Section 5.02 and terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii), in either case if the Board of Directors of
the Company or any committee or subcommittee thereof has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that (x) in the case of clause (I) where the Adverse Recommendation
Change is not made in response to a Takeover Proposal, failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) in the case of (A) clause (I) where such Adverse
Recommendation Change is made in response to a Takeover Proposal or (B) clause
(II), such Takeover Proposal

  


 

  


 

  

 

41  

  


 

  


 

  

constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or subcommittee thereof
shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, take any such action unless (1)
the Company has given Parent at least three business days' prior written
notice (an " _Adverse Recommendation Change/Superior Proposal Notice_ ") (it
being understood and agreed that, in connection with an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to any Superior Proposal or any action contemplated by
clause (II) of this Section 5.02(e), any material change to the financial or
other material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require an
additional Adverse Recommendation Change/Superior Proposal Notice (such one or
more additional notices, an " _Additional Notice_ ") to Parent and a new two
business day period) of its intention to take such action (which notice shall,
(Y) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to any
Superior Proposal or any action contemplated by clause (II) of this Section
5.02(e), specify the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and
the material terms thereof and contain a copy of the agreement or proposal
with respect to such Superior Proposal and, (Z) in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change other than in connection with a Takeover Proposal,
specify the basis for such Adverse Recommendation Change), (2) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect
revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the
Limited Guarantee such that, if a Superior Proposal has been made, it would
cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and,
in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change, it would cause the Board
or such committee or subcommittee no longer to believe that the failure to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (3) following the end of
such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof or subcommittee thereof shall have considered in good faith such
binding offer, and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal, and in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change, shall have determined that the failure to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change would continue to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, in each case if the
revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that any purported termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect unless the
termination is in accordance with Section 7.01 and, to the extent required
under the terms of this Agreement, the Company pays Parent the applicable
Company Termination Fee and Parent Expenses in accordance with Section 7.03
prior to or concurrently with such termination.

  


 

  

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof
or subcommittee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required by
applicable Law or if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the
failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to make such disclosure would
be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their duties to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section
5.02(f) shall not be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board or

  


 

  


 

  

 

42  

  


 

  


 

  

any committee thereof or subcommittee thereof to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change except in accordance with Section 5.02(e).

  


 

  

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "
means (i) any confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company from and
after the date of this Agreement that contains confidentiality provisions that
are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality
agreement need not include explicit or implicit standstill provisions that
would restrict the making of or amendment or modification to Takeover
Proposals, or (ii) any confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement, it being understood that the Company, in its sole
discretion, shall be entitled to waive or release any preexisting explicit or
implicit standstill provisions or similar agreements with any Person or group
of Persons.

  


 

  

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person or group (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, any direct or indirect (i) acquisition of assets that constitute
or account for 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, consolidated net
income or consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including
through the acquisition of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company owning such
assets, (ii) acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common
Stock by any one or more Persons or an issuance by the Company of an amount of
stock equal to 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
to one or more Persons, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or group beneficially owning 20% or
more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or (iv) merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which
such Person or group (or the stockholders of any Person) would acquire,
directly or indirectly, assets that constitute or account for 20% or more of
the consolidated net revenues, consolidated net income or consolidated assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or 20% or more of the aggregate voting
power of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger, consolidation,
share exchange or other business combination involving the Company or the
resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity,
in each case, other than the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
Agreement and the Transactions shall not be deemed a Takeover Proposal.

  


 

  

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Takeover Proposal which was not solicited in, and did not
otherwise result from, a violation of this Section 5.02 that the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or subcommittee thereof has
determined in its good faith judgment (i) would be more favorable to the
Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger
Transactions and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all legal, regulatory, financial, financing and other aspects of such
proposal and of this Agreement; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition
of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

  


 

  

SECTION 5.03. _Efforts._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties
and use (and shall

  


 

  


 

  

 

43  

  


 

  


 

  

cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance
is expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the
other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,

registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Transactions, (iii) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and (iv)
defend or contest in good faith any Action brought by a third party that could
otherwise prevent or impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material
respect the consummation of the Transactions, in the case of each of clauses
(i) through (iv), other than with respect to filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents, approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, which are dealt with in
Sections 5.03(c) and (d) below. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ "
means the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, all applicable foreign antitrust Laws and all other applicable
Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through
merger or acquisition.

  


 

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the
applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law
become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

  


 

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions (which shall request the early termination of any waiting period
applicable to the Transactions under the HSR Act) as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event within 10
days following the date of this Agreement, and to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to promptly take any and all
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all
consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S.
federal, state or local Governmental Authority, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the
Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly take all
actions necessary to secure the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and resolve any
objections asserted with respect to the Transactions under the Federal Trade
Commission Act or any other applicable Law raised by any Governmental

  


 

  


 

  

 

44  

  


 

  


 

  

Authority, in order to prevent the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned, any Restraint that would prevent, prohibit, restrict
or delay the consummation of the Transactions, including (i) (A) executing
settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements
with any Governmental Authority or with any other Person, (B) selling,
divesting or otherwise conveying or holding separate particular assets or

any of the particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, (E)
terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, (F) terminating any joint
venture or other arrangement, (G) creating any relationship, contractual right

effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, entering into agreements or
stipulating to the entry of any Judgment by, or filing appropriate
applications with, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and, in the
case of actions by or with respect to the Company, by consenting to such
action by the Company (including any consents required under this Agreement
with respect to such action); _provided_ that any such action may, at the
discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon the Closing) and (ii) defending
through litigation any claim asserted in court or administrative or other
tribunal by any Person (including any Governmental Authority) in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Restraint that would
prevent the Closing prior to the Outside Date. All such efforts shall be
unconditional and shall not be qualified in any manner and no actions taken
pursuant to this Section 5.03 shall be considered for purposes of determining
whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected
to occur. Parent shall respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as
reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Transactions. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub and any
of their respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the intention
to, or that could reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the expiration or
termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act or the obtaining of
approval of the DOJ or FTC as necessary. Nothing in this Agreement shall
require any party to take or agree to take any action with respect to its
business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Closing.

  


 

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)

submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private person, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed in
all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material

each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, and to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with the other parties hereto with respect to information
relating to the other parties hereto and their respective

  


 

  


 

  

 

45  

  


 

  


 

  

Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third Person or any Governmental Authority
in connection with the Transactions, other than "4(c) documents" or "4(d)
documents" as that term is used in the rules and regulations under the HSR
Act, and (iv) to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other parties
hereto the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.04. _Financing._ (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate

(including the market "flex" provisions) set forth in the Financing Letters,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect and comply
with the Financing Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements (which, with respect to the bridge facility documentation, shall
not be required until determined by Parent to be reasonably likely to be

to the Debt Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions
(including the market "flex" provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter (or on other terms that, with respect to conditionality, are not less
favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than the terms and conditions (including
market "flex" provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter), (iii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub
in the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements related thereto
(including by consummating the Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Equity Funding
Letter) (or, if necessary or deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in such Debt
Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements related thereto), (iv) upon
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger, consummate the Financing
and cause the lenders and the other Persons committing to fund the Financing

Financing Letters and the definitive agreements relating to the Financing and
(vi) otherwise comply with Parent's and Merger Sub's covenants and other
obligations under the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements relating

prior written consent of the Company, agree to or permit any termination of or
amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of
any provision under, the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing if such termination, amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of any portion of
the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount as compared to the fees and original issue discount
contemplated by the Financing Letters on the date of this Agreement unless the
Debt Financing or Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount)
such that the aggregate amount of the Financing would be below the amount
required to pay the Required Amount, (B) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions precedent to the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing
Date or (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing
Letters or the definitive agreements with respect to the Financing. Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any amendment, modification,
supplement, consent or waiver to or under any Financing Letter or the

  


 

  


 

  

 

46  

  


 

  


 

  

definitive agreements relating to the Financing promptly upon execution
thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Section 5.04 shall require, and in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any
source other than the counterparties to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Equity Funding Letter, or (ii) pay any material fees in
excess of those contemplated by the Equity Funding Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any market "flex" provisions contained therein).

  


 

  

(c) Upon request by the Company, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a

the material definitive documents for the Debt Financing. Parent and Merger
Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (i) of any material breach, default,
termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing
Letters or definitive documents related to the Financing of which Parent or
Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any
written notice or other written communication from any Financing source with
respect to any (A) material breach, default, termination, cancellation or
repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters
or any definitive document related to the Financing or (B) material dispute or
disagreement between Parent and any Financing source or among any parties to
any of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the
Financing, in each case regarding the Financing, and (iii) of the occurrence
of an event or development that could reasonably be expected to adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount on the terms and in the manner
contemplated by the Financing Letters. As soon as reasonably practicable, but
in any event within two business days of the date the Company delivers to
Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide
any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. If any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any applicable market "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain, as promptly as practicable, in replacement thereof alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to fund the
Required Amount with terms and conditions (including market "flex" provisions)
not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub (or their respective Affiliates)
than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent
shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of the alternative debt
commitment letters (including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt
Financing. For purposes of this Agreement, references to (x) the "Financing"

requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing,
including using its reasonable best efforts to:

consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such fiscal year
and the related audited statements of income and cash flows;

(iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, inform Parent if the Company or

reasonably likely to require the restatement of any financial statements
comprising a portion of the Required Financial Information in order for such
financial statements to comply with GAAP;

  


 

  

(iv) assist in preparation for and participate in a reasonable number of
investor and lender meetings (including a reasonable and limited number of

(vi) cause its independent auditors to provide, consistent with customary
practice, (A) customary auditors consents and customary comfort letters
(including "negative assurance" comfort and change period comfort) with
respect to financial information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
as reasonably requested by Parent as necessary or customary for financings
similar to the Debt Financing (including any offering or private placement of
debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act), (B)
reasonable assistance to Parent in connection with Parent's preparation of pro
forma financial statements and information and (C) attending accounting due
diligence sessions;

  


 

  

(vii) cooperate reasonably with the Debt Financing sources' due diligence, to
the extent customary and reasonable;

  


 

  

(viii) assist Parent in connection with the preparation of pro forma financial
information and pro forma financial statements and other financial data of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent required by SEC rules and
regulations or necessary or reasonably required by Parent's Financing sources
(including the Debt Financing sources) to be included in any offering
documents or customary marketing materials; _provided_ , that neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be required to
provide any information or assistance relating to (A) the proposed debt and
equity capitalization that is required for such pro forma financial
information or assumed interest rates, dividends (if any) and fees and
expenses relating to such debt and equity capitalization or (B) any post-
Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or
other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information
used in connection with the Debt Financing;

  


 

  

(ix) execute and deliver as of (but not prior to) the Closing any pledge and
security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including
a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to
solvency matters in the form set forth as an annex to the Debt Commitment
Letter) ( _provided_ , that (A) none of the documents or certificates shall be
executed and/or delivered except in connection with the Closing, (B) the
effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become operative after,
the occurrence of the Closing and (C) no liability shall be imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or
employees involved prior to the Closing Date) and otherwise reasonably
facilitate the pledging of collateral;

  


 

  

(x) provide all documentation and other information about the Company and its

Closing; and

  


 

  


 

  

 

49  

  


 

  


 

  

(xi) arrange for customary payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments
of discharge to be delivered at Closing providing for the payoff, discharge
and termination on the Closing Date of all indebtedness contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter to be paid off, discharged and terminated on the
Closing Date;

  


 

  

 _provided_ that such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and _provided_
, _further_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
required to bear any cost or expense, pay any commitment or other fee, enter
into any definitive agreement, incur any other liability or obligation, make
any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time. In addition,
nothing in this Section 5.04 shall require any action that would conflict with
or violate the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' organizational documents
or any Laws or result in, prior to the Effective Time, the contravention of,
or that would reasonably be expected to result in, prior to the Effective
Time, a violation or breach of, or default under, any Contract to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries is a party if such action would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors (with respect to any
Subsidiary of the Company) or employees shall be required to execute or enter
into or perform any agreement with respect to the Financing contemplated by
the Financing Letters that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be
effective prior to the Closing and no directors of the Company that will not
be continuing directors, acting in such capacity, shall be required to execute
or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the Financing.

  


 

  

Parent (i) shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
(A) reasonable attorneys' fees and (B) fees and expenses of the Company's
accounting firms engaged to assist in connection with the Financing, including
performing additional requested procedures, reviewing any offering documents,
participating in any meetings and providing any comfort letters) incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in
connection with the Financing, including the cooperation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and Representatives contemplated by this Section 5.04(c) and
(ii) shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing (including the performance of their
respective obligations under this Section 5.04 (including any action taken in
accordance with this Section 5.04)) and any information used in connection
therewith, in each case other than to the extent any of the foregoing was
suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, in each case, their
respective Affiliates and Representatives.

  


 

  

(e) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos solely in connection
with the Financing; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company

  


 

  


 

  

 

50  

  


 

  


 

  

or the Company's reputation or goodwill and will comply with the Company's
usage requirements to the extent made available to Parent prior to the date of
this Agreement.

  


 

  

(f) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to periodically update any Required Financial Information
provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such Required Financial
Information is (i) Compliant and (ii) meets the applicable requirements set
forth in the definition of "Required Financial Information", in each case
throughout the pendency of the Marketing Period. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, request the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries under this Section 5.04 at any
time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to access the
markets. The Company agrees to (A) file all reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q
and Form 8-K (to the extent required to include financial information pursuant
to Item 9.01 thereof) and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to file all
other Forms 8-K, in each case, required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to
the Exchange Act prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the periods
required by the Exchange Act. If, in connection with a marketing effort
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent reasonably requests the
Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that
contains material non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, which Parent reasonably determines (and which the Company does
not unreasonably object) to include in a customary offering document for the
Debt Financing, then the Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K
containing such material non-public information.

  


 

  

(g) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing.

  


 

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent may
enter discussions regarding, and may enter into arrangements and agreements
relating to the Equity Financing to add other equity providers, so long as in
respect of any such arrangements and agreements, the following conditions are
met: (i) the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing is not reduced; (ii) the
arrangements and agreements, in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely
to delay, impede or prevent the Closing; and (iii) the arrangements and
agreements would not diminish or release the pre-closing obligations of the
parties to the Equity Funding Letter as of the date of this Agreement,
adversely affect the rights of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Equity Funding Letter, or otherwise
constitute a waiver or reduction of Parent's or Merger Sub's rights under the
Equity Funding Letter.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.05. _Public Announcements._ Unless and until an Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred, Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, Judgment, court process or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system and
except for any matters referred to in, and made in compliance with, Section
5.02. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the Transactions following execution of this Agreement shall

  


 

  


 

  

 

51  

  


 

  


 

  

be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties hereto (the "
_Announcement_ "). Notwithstanding the forgoing, this Section 5.05 shall not
apply to any press release or other public statement made by the Company or
Parent (a) which is consistent with the Announcement and the terms of this
Agreement and does not contain any information relating to the Company that
has not been previously announced or made public in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement or (b) is made in the ordinary course of business and does
not relate specifically to the signing of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.06. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Subject to applicable
Law, between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
afford to Parent and Parent's Representatives and sources of Debt Financing
reasonable access during normal business hours to the Company's officers,
employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and records (other than any of
the foregoing that relate to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement,
the process that led to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or,
subject to the disclosure requirements set forth in Section 5.02, to any
Takeover Proposal) and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and
Parent's Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel,
assets, liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided_ that Parent and its Representatives and sources of Debt Financing
shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company; _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to provide
such access or information if the Company determines, in its reasonable
judgment (after consultation with its outside counsel), that doing so is
reasonably likely to (i) violate applicable Law, an applicable Judgment or a
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party ( _provided_
that the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such third party to provide such information), (ii) jeopardize the
protection of an attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection
or other legal privilege, or (iii) expose the Company to risk of liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information. All requests for information
made pursuant to this Section 5.06 shall be directed to the executive officer
or other Person designated by the Company. Until the Effective Time, all
information provided (including information provided by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives pursuant to Section
5.04(c)) will be subject to the terms of the letter agreement dated as of
December 9, 2015, by and between the Company and Apollo Management VIII, L.P.
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  


 

  

SECTION 5.07. _Indemnification and Insurance._ (a) From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, each
individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time was, a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of a
Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in
part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an

  


 

  


 

  

 

52  

  


 

  


 

  

Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a director or officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or, in the case of directors or officers of the
Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company, taken at the request of the Company
or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary as a representative of another Person (including
any employee benefit plan)), in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at
any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole
or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this
provision) and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company Charter Documents
and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement or in any agreement in existence as of the date of this
Agreement providing for indemnification between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from
and after the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees.

  


 

  

(b) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
Section 5.07 (each, a " _Claim_ ") for which indemnification could be sought
by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability
arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to
such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim
and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested
and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  


 

  

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals
who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective
Time become) covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in
amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor
policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with
respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time,
including a "tail" policy), so long as the Surviving Corporation is not
required to pay an annual premium in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company for such insurance before the date of this Agreement (such
300% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). The Company shall have the right
prior to the Effective Time to purchase a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on
terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as
the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to

  


 

  


 

  

 

53  

  


 

  


 

  

matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the Transactions, so long as the effective annual premium under
such policy does not exceed the Maximum Premium. If such prepaid "tail policy"
has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all
obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.07(c) and the
Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to
honor all of its obligations thereunder.

  


 

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.07 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Charter Documents, by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.07
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.07 applies unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.07
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.07).

  


 

  

(e) In the event that (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, or (ii) Parent or any of its
successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 5.07.

  


 

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.07 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  


 

  

(g) Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations under this Section
5.07 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Claim (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against an
Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this Section 5.07 shall continue in effect until the full and
final resolution of such Claim.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.08. _Rule 16b-3._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.09. _Employee Matters._ (a) Subject to any applicable Collective
Bargaining Agreements, for a period of not less than one year following the
Effective Time,

  


 

  


 

  

 

54  

  


 

  


 

  

Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide (i) base
salary and annual cash bonus opportunities to each person who is an employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") while remaining employed that are no
less favorable, in each case, than those in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that are
no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Continuing
Employee under the applicable severance benefit plans, programs, policies,
agreements and arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (iii) employee benefit plans and arrangements (other than base
salary, annual bonus opportunities, long-term incentive opportunities
(including equity-based compensation), severance benefits, defined benefit
pension benefits, retiree or other post-termination health and welfare
benefits) to Continuing Employees (while remaining employed) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that nothing herein shall
preclude the Parent and Merger Sub or the Company from changing terms and
conditions of employment (other than with respect to compensation and
benefits, or as may be required by Law) or terminating the employment of any
employee at any time after the Closing.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.09(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
honor in accordance with their terms all the Company Plans. Parent hereby
acknowledges that the consummation of the Transactions constitutes a "change
in control" or "change of control" (or a term of similar import) for purposes
of any Company Plan that contains a definition of "change in control or
"change of control" (or a term of similar import), as applicable. With respect
to all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including
any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans) of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting, and benefit accruals under any
vacation, paid time-off or severance plans, each Continuing Employee's service
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (ii) for purposes of
any Parent benefit plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent and
its subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service, or (iii) for
purposes of any plan or arrangement that is grandfathered or frozen, either
with respect to the level of benefits or participation.

  


 

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.09(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, take commercially reasonable efforts to
waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any
welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents)
will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to
the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-
at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or
waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. To the extent commercially practicable, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and

  


 

  


 

  

 

55  

  


 

  


 

  

similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.09 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.09 is intended
to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment
to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and, except as
otherwise explicitly provided for in this Agreement, or (ii) prevent the
modification, termination or amendment of any benefit plan, program,
arrangement or agreement in the sole discretion of the Parent and the
Surviving Company and its subsidiaries. No current or former employee or any
other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the
provisions hereof or confer upon such individual the right to continue
employment with the Parent, or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time, or interfere with any right or ability of the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any employee for any reason or no reason following the Effective
Time.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.10. _Company ESPP._ With respect to the Company ESPP, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that (a) no offering period under
the Company ESPP shall commence on or after the date of this Agreement, (b) no
new participants may join the offering period in existence under the Company
ESPP on or after the date of this Agreement and (c) no participant may
increase the amount of his or her salary deferrals with respect to such
offering period. In the event that the offering period under the Company ESPP
in effect as of the date of this Agreement has not ended on the date
immediately preceding the Effective Time, then the Company ESPP and such
offering period shall be terminated as of the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time, and all participant contributions then in the Company ESPP
shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock on such date in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP as if such date was the last day
of such offering period. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock purchased under the Company ESPP shall be treated identically to
all other shares of Company Common Stock with respect to the payment of the
Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 2.01(c), and the Company shall
cause the Company ESPP to terminate. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall adopt such resolutions and take all other such actions as may reasonably
be necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.10.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.11. _Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation._ Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (a) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any Actions commenced or, to such party's
Knowledge, threatened against such party which relates to this Agreement or
the Transactions and (c) any fact, event or circumstance that (i) has had or
would reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material

  


 

  


 

  

 

56  

  


 

  


 

  

Adverse Effect, as applicable, or (ii) is reasonably likely to result in the
failure of any of the Offer Conditions or any of conditions set forth in
Article VI to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
(or failure to provide such notification) shall affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions
to the obligations of, the parties hereunder. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  


 

  

SECTION 5.12. _Parent Vote._ Promptly following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub,
will execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent
adopting this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.13. _Stock Exchange De-listing._ Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Company Common Stock to be de-listed from NASDAQ and de-
registered under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.14. _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Compensation Committee_ ") will cause each employment compensation, severance
or other employee benefit arrangement pursuant to which consideration is
payable to any officer, director or employee who is a holder of any security
of the Company to be approved by the Compensation Committee (comprised solely
of "independent directors") in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of
the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.15. _Transfer of Company Common Stock Owned by Parent_. Prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (other
than Merger Sub) to, transfer all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially
owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to Merger Sub.

  


 

  


 

  

ARTICLE VI

  


 

  

 _Conditions to the Merger_

  


 

  

SECTION 6.01. _Conditions to Each Party 's Obligation To Effect the Merger._
The respective obligations of each party hereto to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible under applicable Law)
on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:

  


 

  

(a) _No Restraints._ No Judgment enacted, promulgated, issued, entered,
amended or enforced by any Governmental Authority or any applicable Law
(collectively, " _Restraints_ ") shall be in effect enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Merger; and

  


 

  


 

  

 

57

payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

 _Termination_

  


 

  

SECTION 7.01. _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time (except
as otherwise expressly noted):

  


 

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  


 

  

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

  


 

  

(i) if (A) the Offer Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or prior to
July 9, 2016 (as such date may be extended pursuant to the immediately
succeeding proviso, the " _Outside Date_ ") or (B) the Offer shall have
expired pursuant to its terms and the terms of this Agreement (without being
extended in accordance with this Agreement) without Merger Sub having
irrevocably accepted for payment the shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer in accordance with
this Agreement solely as a result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum
Condition; _provided_ that in the event that the Marketing Period has
commenced, but the Offer Acceptance Time has not yet occurred, then the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended to the date that is five business
days following the then-scheduled end date of the Marketing Period (which for
the avoidance of doubt shall not be later than August 4, 2016); _provided_
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.01(b)(i) shall (1) not be available to any party if the breach by such party
of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement
has been a principal cause of or resulted in the events specified in this
Section 7.01(b)(i) (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be
deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing proviso) and (2) be
subject to the proviso set forth in Section 7.01(d)(iii); or

  


 

  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in paragraph (b) of Annex I
shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_
that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.01(b)(ii) shall have used the required efforts to prevent the entry of and
to remove such Restraint in accordance with its obligations under this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) by Parent:

  


 

  

(i) if the Company shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (d), (e) or (f) of Annex I
and (B) is incapable of being cured or, if

  


 

  


 

  

 

58  

  


 

  


 

  

capable of being cured by the Outside Date, the Company (1) shall not have
commenced good faith efforts to cure such breach or failure to perform within
20 calendar days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such
breach or failure to perform from Parent stating Parent's intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(c)(i) and the basis for
such termination or (2) is not thereafter continuing to take good faith
efforts to cure such breach or failure to perform; _provided_ that Parent
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.01(c)(i) if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

  


 

  

(ii) if an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred (whether or not
in compliance with Section 5.02).

  


 

  

(d) by the Company:

  


 

  

(i) if (A) Merger Sub shall have failed to commence the Offer in accordance
with Section 1.01(a) or (B) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of
its representations or warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (1)
would give rise to a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (2) is incapable of
being cured or, if capable of being cured by the Outside Date, Parent and
Merger Sub (x) shall not have commenced good faith efforts to cure such breach
or failure to perform within 20 calendar days following receipt by Parent or
Merger Sub of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from the
Company stating the Company's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.01(d)(i) and the basis for such termination or (y) are not
thereafter continuing to take good faith efforts to cure such breach or
failure to perform; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(d)(i) if the Company is
then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements hereunder;

  


 

  

(ii) in connection with entering into a Company Acquisition Agreement in
accordance with Section 5.02(e)(II); _provided_ that prior to or concurrently
with such termination the Company pays the Company Termination Fee and Parent
Expenses due under Section 7.03(a); or

  


 

  

(iii) if (A) the Marketing Period has ended, (B) the conditions set forth in
Annex I have been satisfied or waived at the Expiration Time (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance
Time, but subject to such conditions being able to be satisfied), and (C)
Merger Sub shall have failed to consummate (as defined in Section 251(h) of
the DGCL) the Offer within four business days following the Expiration Time;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in Section 7.01(b)(i) to the
contrary, no party shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(b)(i) during any such four business-day period.

  


 

  

SECTION 7.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of the valid termination
of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.01, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties hereto, specifying the provision hereof
pursuant to which such termination is

  


 

  


 

  

 

59  

  


 

  


 

  

made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than
Sections 7.02 and 7.03, Article VIII, the expense reimbursement and
indemnification provisions of Section 5.04(c), and the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Limited Guarantee, all of which shall survive termination of
this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates,
except subject to Section 7.03(d) and Section 7.03(e) (including the
limitations on liability set forth therein) no such termination shall relieve
any party from liability for damages to another party resulting from a Willful
Breach of this Agreement or from fraud. " _Willful Breach_ " means a material
breach, or a material failure to perform, in each case that is the consequence
of an act or omission by a party with the actual knowledge that the taking of
such act or failure to take such act would cause a breach of this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent's or Merger Sub's failure to cause the
Offer Acceptance Time to occur and to effect the Closing when required under
this Agreement shall be a Willful Breach of this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 7.03. _Termination Fee_. (a) In the event that:

  


 

  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(i) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i) (as a result of a
breach by the Company of Section 5.02); _provided_ that (A) at the time of
termination (x) the Financing Letters shall not have been terminated,
withdrawn or rescinded without being replaced in compliance with Section 5.04
and (y) the Company shall not have been entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(iii), (B) a bona fide Takeover Proposal shall have
been publicly made, proposed or communicated (or shall have otherwise become
publicly known) after the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn prior to
the time of termination and (C) within 12 months of the date this Agreement is
terminated, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Takeover Proposal and, at any time thereafter, consummates such Takeover
Proposal; _provided_ that, for purposes of clauses (B) and (C) of this Section
7.03(a)(i), the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%"; or

  


 

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section
7.01(c)(ii) or (B) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii);

  


 

  

then, in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7.03(a), the
Company shall pay the applicable Company Termination Fee and Parent Expenses
to Parent or its designee by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case
of Section 7.03(a)(ii)(A), within two business days after such termination,
(y) in the case of Section 7.03(a)(ii)(B), simultaneously with such
termination or (z) in the case of Section 7.03(a)(i), within two business days
after the consummation of the Takeover Proposal referred to therein; it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
applicable Company Termination Fee and Parent Expenses on more than one
occasion.

  


 

  

As used herein, "Company Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to
$34,000,000, except that "Company Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount
equal to $17,000,000 in the event that:

  


 

  


 

  

 

60  

  


 

  


 

  

(1) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(ii) in
a circumstance in which the Adverse Recommendation Change giving rise to the
right of termination is based on a Takeover Proposal (or any amendment or
modification to a predecessor Takeover Proposal) submitted prior to the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period (a " _Qualifying Takeover Proposal_ ") in
respect of which the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee or
subcommittee thereof first delivered an Adverse Recommendation Change/Superior
Proposal Notice pursuant to Section 5.02(e) prior to the expiration of the Go-
Shop Period (irrespective of whether any Additional Notice is delivered after
the expiration of the Go-Shop Period as a result of an amendment or
modification to such Qualifying Takeover Proposal); or

  


 

  

(2) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.01(d)(ii) in connection with entering into a Company Acquisition Agreement
with any Person that submitted a Qualifying Takeover Proposal in respect of
which the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee or subcommittee
thereof first delivered an Adverse Recommendation Change/Superior Proposal
Notice pursuant to Section 5.02(e) prior to the expiration of the Go-Shop
Period (irrespective of whether any Additional Notice is delivered after the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period as a result of an amendment or modification
to such Qualifying Takeover Proposal).

  


 

  

(b) In the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(d)(i) or Section 7.01(d)(iii), or Parent shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) and at such time the Company could
have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i) or Section
7.01(d)(iii), then Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of
$95,000,000 in cash (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
same-day funds simultaneously with such termination, it being understood that
in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

  


 

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.03 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other parties hereto would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.03, and, in order to
obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences an
Action which results in a judgment against the other party, with respect to
Parent or Merger Sub, or parties, with respect to the Company, for the payment
set forth in this Section 7.03, such paying party shall pay the other party or
parties, as applicable, together with interest on such amount at the prime
rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received.

  


 

  

(d) Subject in all respects to the Company's injunction, specific performance
and equitable relief rights set forth in Section 8.08 and the reimbursement
and indemnification obligations of Parent under Section 5.04(c) and Section
7.03(c) hereof, (i) in the event the Parent Termination Fee is paid to the
Company in circumstances for which such fee is payable pursuant to Section
7.03(b), payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantors or any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, financing sources, managers, members,
directors, officers or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Related_

  


 

  


 

  

 

61  

  


 

  


 

  

 _Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions,
and (ii) upon payment of such amount none of the Parent Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions. Subject in all respects to Parent's injunction,
specific performance and equitable relief rights set forth in Section 8.08 and
the reimbursement obligations of the Company under Section 7.03(c) hereof, (A)
in the event the Company Termination Fee and Parent Expenses are paid to
Parent in circumstances for which such fee is payable pursuant to Section
7.03(a), payment of the Company Termination Fee and Parent Expenses shall be
the sole and exclusive monetary damages remedy of the Parent Related Parties
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,
members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any
loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and (B) upon
payment of such amounts none of the Company Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions. While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a
grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 8.08 and the payment
of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee and Parent
Expenses, as applicable, under Section 7.03, under no circumstances shall the
Company or Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in a Closing and any money damages, including all or
any portion of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee and
Parent Expenses, as applicable.

  


 

  

(e) In connection with any loss suffered by any Parent Related Party as a
result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, other than in the circumstances in
which Parent is entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee and Parent
Expenses in accordance with Section 7.03(a) (in which case Section 7.03(d)
shall apply), Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and the Parent Related
Parties, that the maximum aggregate monetary liability of the Company and the
Company Related Parties, if any, shall be limited to the amount of the Company
Termination Fee and Parent Expenses, and in no event shall Parent or any
Parent Related Party seek or be entitled to recover from the Company or any
Company Related Parties, and Parent on behalf of itself and the Parent Related
Parties hereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes any right to seek or
recover, any monetary damages in excess of such amount. In connection with any
loss suffered by any Company Related Party as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise, other than in the circumstances in which the Company is entitled
to receive the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.03(b) (in
which case Section 7.03(d) shall apply) and without limiting the reimbursement
and indemnification obligations of Parent under Section 5.04(c), the Company
agrees, on behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties, that the maximum
aggregate monetary liability of Parent and the Parent Related Parties, if any,
shall be limited to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee, and in no event
shall the Company or any Company Related Party seek or be entitled to recover
from Parent or any Parent Related Parties, and the Company on behalf of itself
and the Company Related Parties hereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes any
right to seek or recover, any monetary damages in excess of such amount.

ARTICLE VIII

  


 

  

 _Miscellaneous_

  


 

  

SECTION 8.01. _No Survival of Representations and Warranties._ None of the
representations or warranties in this Agreement or in any document or
instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time. This Section 8.01 shall not limit any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or in any document or instrument
delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement that by its terms
applies in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.02. _Amendment or Supplement._ Subject to compliance with applicable
Law, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, this Agreement may be
amended or supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement of the
parties hereto. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented after the
Offer Acceptance Time. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein,
the provisions set forth in Section 7.02, Section 7.03(d), this Section 8.02,
Section 8.06, Section 8.07(c), Section 8.09, and Section 8.14 in each case may
not be amended, modified or altered in any manner adverse to the Financing
sources identified in the Debt Commitment Letter in any material respect
without the prior written consent of such Financing sources.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.03. _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, Parent and the Company may, subject to applicable Law, (a)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, (b)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
other party or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements contained herein applicable to such party or, except as otherwise
provided herein, waive any of such party's conditions (it being understood
that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the
foregoing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.04. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment by any party shall
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this Section 8.04 shall be null and void.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.05. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall

  


 

  


 

  

 

63  

  


 

  


 

  

become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.06. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement
and the Company Disclosure Letter, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Limited Guarantee and the Equity Funding Letter (collectively,
the " _Related Documents_ "), constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement is not intended to and does not
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, except for: (i) if the Offer Acceptance Time occurs, the right of
the Company's stockholders that validly tendered their shares of Company
Common Stock in the Offer to receive the Offer Price in respect of such
shares; (ii) if the Effective Time occurs, the right of the Company's
stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration; (iii) if the Effective Time
occurs, the right of the holders of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Shares, Company RSUs, Company DSUs and PSU Awards to receive such amounts as
provided for in Section 2.03; (iv) if the Effective Time occurs, the rights of
the Indemnitees set forth in Section 5.07 of this Agreement; (v) the rights of
the Parent Related Parties and the Company Related Parties set forth in
Section 7.03(d) and Section 7.03(e); (vi) the rights of the Company's
Subsidiaries and the respective Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries set forth in Section 5.04(c); and (vii) the rights of the Non-
Party Affiliates set forth in Section 8.14, which are intended for the benefit
of the Persons and shall be enforceable by the Persons referred to in clauses
(i) through (vii) above. In addition to the foregoing, the Financing sources
identified in the Debt Commitment Letter shall be third party beneficiaries
of, and shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of, Section 7.02, Section
7.03(d), Section 8.02, this Section 8.06, Section 8.07(c), Section 8.09 and
Section 8.14.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.07. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction._ (a) This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within that State, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
any applicable conflict of Laws principles.

  


 

  

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over any Action, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of such courts in any such Action and irrevocably waive the defense of
an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such
Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section
8.07(b) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other
than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process upon
such party in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in
Section 8.10 of this Agreement or in such other manner as may be permitted by
applicable Law. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing in the

  


 

  


 

  

 

64  

  


 

  


 

  

foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto agrees that (i) it will not bring or support any Actions
against the Financing sources identified in the Debt Commitment Letter arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located within the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, whether a state or Federal
court and (ii) the provisions of Section 8.09 relating to the waiver of jury
trial shall apply to any such Actions.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.08. _Specific Enforcement._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary relief (including any fees payable
pursuant to Section 7.03), even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if
the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to
consummate this Agreement. Subject to the following sentence, the parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof (including any obligation to extend the Offer and, to the
extent ordered by any of the courts described in Section 8.07(b), to
recommence the Offer) in the courts described in Section 8.07(b) without proof
of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in
Section 7.03 (i) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the
harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (e)) and (ii) shall
not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party's
right to specific enforcement and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the Transactions and without that right neither the Company
nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with enforcing Parent's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
to fund the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration and Parent's and Merger
Sub's obligations to cause the Offer Acceptance Time to occur and to effect
the Closing (but not the right of the Company to seek such injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall
be subject to the requirements that (i) the Marketing Period has ended, (ii)
all conditions in Annex I were satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time, but subject to
such conditions being able to be satisfied) or waived at the Expiration Time,
(iii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof
or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iv) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it
would take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing
to occur. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law,
other than an assertion that the exercise of specific performance was not
effected in accordance with provisions of this Section 8.08. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement

  


 

  


 

  

 

65  

  


 

  


 

  

and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 8.08 shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY ACTION RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR INVOLVING ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 8.09.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.10. _Notices._ All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered

(9) hereof) is a Material Adverse Effect); _provided_ , _further_ , _however_

disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, as compared to other participants in the industry in which the

Annex I

  


 

  

Conditions to the Offer

  


 

  

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or the Offer and in
addition to (and not in limitation of) Merger Sub's right to extend and amend
the Offer pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be
required to (and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to) accept
for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, pay for any shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
if any of the following conditions exist or have occurred and are continuing
at the scheduled Expiration Time of the Offer:

  


 

  

(a) _Minimum Condition._ The number of shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered (and not properly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of the Offer
(but excluding shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that
have not yet been "received", as defined by Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL),
together with the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Merger Sub
(other than any Rollover Shares), do not represent at least one share more
than 50% of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Minimum Condition_ ").

  


 

  

(b) _Restraints._ Any Restraint shall be in effect enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

  


 

  

(c) _Governmental Consents._ The waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act
and the Other Required Antitrust Laws shall not have expired and early
termination thereof shall not have been granted and the approvals under the
Other Required Antitrust Laws shall not have been received.

  


 

  

(d) _Representations and Warranties._ The representations and warranties of
the Company (i) set forth in Section 3.01(a), Section 3.02(c), Section
3.03(a), Section­­­­ 3.06(b) and Section 3.14 shall not be true and correct in
all material respects as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though
made as of the Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), (ii) set forth in
Section 3.02(a), Section 3.02(b) and Section 3.20 shall not be true and
correct in all material respects as of the Expiration Time with the same
effect as though made as of the Expiration Time (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date)
and (iii) set forth in the Agreement, other than those Sections specifically
identified in clause (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (d), shall not be true and
correct (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality",
"Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) as of
the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration
Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case
as of such earlier date), except, in the case of this clause (iii), where the
failure to be true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Solely for purposes
of clause (ii) of this paragraph (d), if one or more inaccuracies in the
sections referred to in clause (ii) of this paragraph (d) would cause the
aggregate amount required to be paid by Parent or

  


 

  


 

  

 

1  

  


 

  


 

  

Merger Sub to consummate the Offer and the Merger and pay all fees and
expenses in connection therewith to increase by $15 million or more, such
inaccuracy or inaccuracies will be considered material. Parent shall not have
received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer
of the Company to such effect.

  


 

  

(e) _Compliance with Covenants._ The Company shall not have complied with or
performed in all material respects its obligations required to be complied
with or performed by it prior to the Expiration Time under the Agreement and
such failure to comply or perform shall not have been cured by the Expiration
Time. Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by an executive officer of the Company to such effect.

  


 

  

(f) _Company Material Adverse Effect Condition._ Since the date of the
Agreement there shall have been any effect, change, event or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall not have received a certificate
signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company to such
effect.

  


 

  

(g) _No Termination of Agreement._ This Agreement shall have been terminated
in accordance with its terms.

  


 

  

(h) _Marketing Period_. The Marketing Period shall not have been completed.

  


 

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, other than the Minimum Condition, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub
in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable Law. The failure by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right,
the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

  


 

  

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is annexed.

Exhibit A

  


 

  

AMENDED AND RESTATED

  

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF

  

THE FRESH MARKET, INC.

  

(a Delaware corporation)

  


 

  


 

  

ARTICLE I

  


 

  

The name of the Corporation is THE FRESH MARKET, INC.

  


 

  

ARTICLE II

  


 

  

The address of the Corporation's registered office in the State of Delaware is
located at 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, in the County of New
Castle, 19801. The registered agent of the Company for service of process at
such address is The Corporation Trust Company.

  


 

  

ARTICLE III

  


 

  

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware as it now exists or may hereafter be amended and/or
supplemented from time to time (the " _DGCL_ ").

  


 

  

ARTICLE IV

  


 

  

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation is
authorized to issue is one thousand (1,000) shares of capital stock, all of
which shall be common stock with a par value of one cent ($0.01) per share
(the " _Common Stock_ "). Each holder of record of Common Stock shall be
entitled to vote at all meetings of the stockholders and shall have one vote
for each share held by such holder of record.

  


 

  

ARTICLE V

  


 

  

From time to time, any of the provisions of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed, and other
provisions authorized by the DGCL or other statutes or laws of the State of
Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at
the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon
the stockholders of the Corporation by this Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation are granted subject to this reservation.

  


 

  

ARTICLE VI

  


 

  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the rights, powers, privileges and
discretionary authority granted or conferred by the DGCL or other statutes or
laws of the State of Delaware,

  


 

  


 

  

 

1  

  


 

  


 

  

the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") is expressly
authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation (the
" _Bylaws_ "), without any action on the part of the stockholders, but the
stockholders may make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws whether adopted by
them or otherwise.

  


 

  

ARTICLE VII

  


 

  

Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws shall so
require.

  


 

  

ARTICLE VIII

  


 

  

To the fullest extent permitted by law, as it now exists or may hereafter be
amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty owed to the Corporation or its stockholders. Neither the amendment nor
repeal of this Article VIII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, nor, to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, any modification of law shall eliminate, reduce or
otherwise adversely affect any right or protection of a current or former
director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal,
adoption or modification. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

  


 

  

ARTICLE IX

  


 

  

Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware,
as the Bylaws may provide. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any
annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding Common Stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and
shall be delivered to the Corporation.

  


 

  

The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained
in the DGCL) within or outside of the State of Delaware at such place or
places as may be designated from time to time by the Board or in the Bylaws.

  


 

  

ARTICLE X

  


 

  

Neither any contract or other transaction between the Corporation and any
other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
firm, association, or other entity (an " _Entity_ "), nor any other acts of
the Corporation with relation to any other Entity will, in the absence of
fraud, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in any way be
invalidated or otherwise affected by the fact that any one or more of the
directors or officers of the Corporation are pecuniary or otherwise interested
in, or are directors, officers, partners, or members of, such other Entity
(such directors, officers, and Entities, each a " _Related Person_ "). Any
Related Person may be a party to, or may be pecuniary or otherwise interested
in, any contract or transaction of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the fact that person is a

  


 

  


 

  

 

2  

  


 

  


 

  

Related Person or is pecuniary or otherwise interested in such contract or
transaction is disclosed or is known to the Board or a majority of directors
present at any meeting of the Board at which action upon any such contract or
transaction is taken. Any director of the Corporation who is also a Related
Person or who is pecuniary or otherwise interested in such contract or
transaction may be counted in determining the existence of a quorum at any

Corporation, its directors, officers or employees, of its or their right to
proceed with such contract, transaction or act.
