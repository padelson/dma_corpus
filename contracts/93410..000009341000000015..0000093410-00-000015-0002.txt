-viii-       AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 
----------------------------   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this
"Agreement") dated as of October 15, 2000 by and among TEXACO INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), CHEVRON CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and KEEPEP INC., a newly formed Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Subsidiary").   W I T N E
S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and the Company have approved this Agreement, and deem it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders to
consummate the merger of Merger Subsidiary with and into the Company on the
terms and conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, for United States federal
income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger contemplated by this
Agreement qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Code");   WHEREAS, for accounting purposes, it
is intended that the Merger be accounted for as a "pooling of interests"
under United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission");   WHEREAS, (i) as a condition and inducement to Parent\'s
willingness to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Parent and the Company are entering into a Stock
Option Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement in the form attached
as Exhibit A (the "Company Option Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company
shall grant to Parent an option to purchase shares of common stock, par value
$3.125 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") at $53.71 per
share, under certain circumstances, and (ii) as a condition and inducement to
the Company\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and the Company are
entering into a Stock Option Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement
in the form attached as Exhibit B (the "Parent Option Agreement" and,
together with the Company Option Agreement, the "Option Agreements"),
pursuant to which Parent shall grant to the Company an option to purchase
shares of common stock, par value $0.75 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common
Stock"), at $85.96 per share, under certain circumstances.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:     -1-    ARTICLE 1 
-----------  THE MERGER  -----------   SECTION 1.1 The Merger. 
----------   (a)......At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be
merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with the
requirements of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"Delaware Law"), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").   (b)......On the Closing Date, immediately after
the Closing, the Company will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings
required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is
specified in the certificate of merger (the "Effective Time").  
(c)......From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to
all of the restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.   (d)......The
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (i) at the offices of
Pillsbury Madison and Sutro LLP, 50 Fremont Street, San Francisco, California,
as soon as practicable on the day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived
of the conditions set forth in Article 8 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be fulfilled at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) shall be fulfilled or waived
in accordance with this Agreement, including pursuant to Sections 5.2 and
7.1, or (ii) at such other place and time or on such other date as the
Company and Parent may agree in writing (the date of the Closing, the
"Closing Date").   SECTION 1.2 Conversion of Shares. 
--------------------   (a)......At the Effective Time by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:   (i) each
share of the Company Common Stock held by the Company  as treasury stock or
owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent or the  Company (excluding
shares, if any, held in any "Rabbi trust" identified  on Section 3.14 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, which may be  accounted for as treasury stock
("Rabbi Trust Shares")) immediately  prior to the Effective Time (together
with the associated Company Right  (as defined in Section 3.5), if any) shall
be canceled, and no payment  shall be made with respect thereto;  
-2-    (ii) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted  into and become
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation  with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted  and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of  the Surviving Corporation;
and   (iii) each share of Company Common Stock (including each Rabbi  Trust
Share) (together with the associated Company Right) outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, except as otherwise  provided in Section
1.2(a)(i), be converted into the right to receive  0.77 of a share of Parent
Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio"),  including the corresponding fraction of
a right to purchase shares of  Series A Participating Preferred Stock of
Parent (the "Parent Rights")  in accordance with the Rights Agreement (the
"Parent Rights Agreement")  dated as of November 23, 1998 between Parent and
ChaseMellon  Shareholder Services, L.L.C., as Rights Agent. References herein
to  shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger shall 
also be deemed to include the associated Parent Rights.   (b) All Parent
Common Stock issued as provided in this Section 1.2 shall be of the same
class and shall have the same terms as the currently outstanding Parent
Common Stock. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be received as
consideration pursuant to the Merger with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
as specified below) are referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration."  
(c) From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock
(together with the associated Company Rights) converted in accordance
with Section 1.2(a)(iii) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any dividends payable pursuant to Section 1.3(f). From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Subsidiary shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with Section 1.2(a)(ii).   SECTION 1.3 Surrender
and Payment.  ---------------------   (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C. or such other
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent")
for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock ("Certificates") for the Merger Consideration. Parent will make
available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be
delivered in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time, a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in
such form as the Company and Parent may reasonably     -3-   agree, for
use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange
Agent.   (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have
been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, will be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after
the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration.   (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to
the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable. For purposes of this Agreement, "Person"
means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a
partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or organization,
including a government or political subdivision or any agency or
instrumentality thereof.   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article 1.   (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.3(a) that remains
unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged his shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.3 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such holder\'s shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
not be liable to any holder of shares for any Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws. Any
Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company
Common Stock three years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any governmental entity) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (f) No dividends or
other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates
until such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this Section 1.3.
Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following such surrender, there
shall be paid, without interest, to the record     -4-   holder of the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of
such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of
such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not
previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends
or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger (but not options
therefor described in Section 1.4 unless actually exercised at the Effective
Time) shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.   SECTION
1.4 Stock Options and Equity Awards.  -------------------------------   (a)
The Board of Directors of the Company shall take such action as is necessary
so that at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") granted under the Company\'s
plans or agreements identified in Company Disclosure Schedule (defined in the
introductory clause to Article 3) 1.4 as being the only compensation
or benefit plans or agreements pursuant to which shares of Company Common
Stock may be issued (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans"), whether
vested or not vested, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock and shall thereafter constitute an option to acquire, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock
Option (including without limitation the stock option restoration feature
applicable thereto) pursuant to the relevant Company Stock Option Plan under
which it was issued and the agreement evidencing the grant thereof prior to
the Effective Time, the number (rounded to the nearest whole number) of
shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio. The
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to any such Company
Stock Option at and after the Effective Time shall be an amount (rounded to
the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal to (x) the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option prior to
the Effective Time, divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Section 1.4(a), if use of the above methods would
disqualify the Merger as a "pooling of interests" for financial accounting
purposes, then such methods will be adjusted to the extent necessary to
preserve such accounting treatment. In addition, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will make any amendments to the terms of such Company Stock
Option Plans that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 1.4. The Company represents and warrants that no
consents are or will be necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 1.4.   (b) Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to assume as of the Effective Time the Company\'s
obligations under the Company Stock Options and reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery pursuant to
the terms set forth in this Section 1.4.     -5-    (c) At the
Effective Time, each award or account (including restricted stock, stock
equivalents and stock units, but excluding Company Stock Options) outstanding
as of the Effective Time ("Company Award") that has been established, made or
granted under any employee incentive or benefit plans, programs or
arrangements and non-employee director plans maintained by the Company on or
prior to the date hereof that provide for grants of equity-based awards or
equity-based accounts and which are identified in Company Schedule 1.4 shall
to the extent practicable be amended or converted into a similar instrument
of Parent, in each case with such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
such Company Awards as are appropriate to preserve the value inherent in such
Company Awards with no detrimental effects on the holders thereof. The other
terms and conditions of each Company Award, and the plans or agreements under
which they were issued, shall continue to apply in accordance with their
terms and conditions, including any provisions for acceleration (as such
terms and conditions have been interpreted and applied by the Company
in accordance with its past practice), but with such adjustments, if any, as
may be necessary or appropriate in light of the transactions contemplated
hereby and which do not materially affect the intended value of such awards,
in each case to the extent consistent with Section 7.4. The Company
represents and warrants that (i) there are as of the date hereof no Company
Awards or Company Stock Options other than those reflected in Section 3.5 and
(ii) all employee incentive or benefit plans, programs or arrangements and
non-employee director plans under which any Company Award has been
established, made or granted and all Company Stock Option Plans are disclosed
in Company Disclosure Schedule 1.4.   (d) As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall file with the Commission a registration
statement on an appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a
previously filed registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to the Parent Common Stock
subject to options and other equity based awards described in this Section
1.4, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the current status
of the prospectus contained therein, as well as comply with any applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as such options or other
equity based awards remain outstanding.   SECTION 1.5 Adjustments. 
-----------  If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Parent or the Company shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   SECTION 1.6
Fractional Shares.  -----------------   (a) No fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder
of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.6, a cash payment in lieu of
such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock representing such holder\'s
proportionate interest, if any, in the     -6-   proceeds from the sale
by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the excess of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) over (y) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock to be distributed to the holders of Certificates pursuant to Section
1.3(b) (such excess being herein called the "Excess Shares"). The parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of
issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained for consideration but
merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the
corporate and accounting problems that would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at
then prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") in the
manner provided in the following paragraph.   (b) The sale of the Excess
Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders that would otherwise
receive fractional shares, shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more
member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. The compensation payable to the Exchange Agent and the expenses
incurred by the Exchange Agent, in each case, in connection with such sale or
sales of the Excess Shares, and all related commissions, transfer taxes and
other out-of-pocket transaction costs, will be paid by the Surviving
Corporation out of its own funds and will not be paid directly or indirectly
by Parent. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Common Shares Trust"). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the
Common Shares Trust to which each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate
proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of
shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and
the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share
interests to which all holders of shares of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled.   (c) As soon as practicable after the determination
of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the
Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of shares of
Company Common Stock without interest.   SECTION 1.7 Withholding Rights. 
------------------  Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Article 1 such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   -7-    SECTION 1.8
Lost Certificates.  -----------------  If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate
as contemplated by this Article 1.   SECTION 1.9 Shares Held by Company
Affiliates.  ---------------------------------  Anything to the contrary
herein notwithstanding, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates
therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any Certificate to any Person who
may be an "affiliate" of the Company (identified pursuant to Section 7.8)
until such Person shall have delivered to Parent duly executed letters as
contemplated by Section 7.8. Such Person shall be subject to the restrictions
described in such letters, and such shares (or certificates therefor) shall
bear a legend describing such restrictions.   SECTION 1.10 Appraisal
Rights.  -----------------  In accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware
Law, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the Merger.   ARTICLE 2  ---------

remainder of whom shall be directors of Parent prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent shall take all
action necessary to increase the size of the Board of Directors of Parent as
necessary and to elect the Company Board Designees to the Board of Directors

concerned with matters relating to planning the integration after the
Effective Time of Parent and the Company, including organization and
staffing. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.3, Parent shall not be
deemed to control the business or operations of the Company and, likewise,
the Company shall not be deemed to control the business or operations of
Parent. The members of the Transition Committee may delegate specific tasks
to others and otherwise will draw upon the resources of Parent and the
Company as necessary or appropriate.   SECTION 2.4 Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. 
----------------------------------------------------------  The certificate
of incorporation of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until subsequently

ARTICLE 3  ---------  REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE
COMPANY  --------------------------------------------------------  The
Company represents and warrants to Parent that (except as set forth in the
disclosure schedules delivered by the Company to Parent simultaneously with
the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedules")):  
SECTION 3.1 Corporate Existence and Power.  ----------------------------- 
The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all
corporate powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have,
or be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property
owned or leased by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or be
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to any
Person means a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business,
liabilities, properties, assets or results of operations of such Person and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except, to the extent resulting from (x)
any changes in general United States or global economic conditions, (y) any
changes affecting the oil and gas industry in general (including changes to
commodity prices) except, other than where referring to a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent after the Effective Time, to the extent that the changes
disproportionately affect Parent or the Company, as applicable, compared to
the manner in which the changes affect the other party or (z) any disposition
of the Alliance Interests (as defined in Section 7.1) in accordance with the
terms of Section 7.1. The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent true and
complete copies of the Company\'s certificate of incorporation and by-laws as
currently in effect.   SECTION 3.2 Corporate Authorization. 
-----------------------   (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the Option Agreements and the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are within
the Company\'s corporate powers and, except for any required approval by the
Company\'s stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Approval") in connection
with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger is the only vote of the holders of
any of the Company\'s capital stock necessary in connection with consummation
of the Merger. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Option Agreements by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary, as
applicable, each of this Agreement and each Option Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,    -10-   insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights, and to
general equity principles.   (b) The Company\'s Board of Directors, at a
meeting duly called and held on or prior to the date hereof, has (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Option Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including the Merger) are advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of the Company\'s stockholders, (ii) approved and
adopted this Agreement and the Option Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including the Merger), and (iii) resolved
(subject to Section 5.2) to recommend the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger by its stockholders.   SECTION 3.3 Governmental
Authorization.  ---------------------------  The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Option Agreements and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
governmental body, agency, official or authority other than (a) the filing of
a certificate of merger in accordance with Delaware Law, (b) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements

of Council Regulation No. 4064/89 of the European Community, as amended (the
"EC Merger Regulation"), (d) compliance with any applicable requirements of
laws, rules and regulations in other foreign jurisdictions governing
antitrust or merger control matters, (e) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act"),
(f) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act and (g)
other actions or filings which if not taken or made would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have, or be reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or prevent or materially delay the Company\'s
consummation of the Merger.   SECTION 3.4 Non-Contravention. 
-----------------  The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement and the Option Agreements and the consummation by the Company

assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, (a)
contravene or conflict with the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
the Company, (b) contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any
provision of any law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree
binding upon or applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c)
constitute a default under or give rise to a right of termination,

of its Subsidiaries or to a loss of any benefit to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement,
contract or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit or other similar authorization
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (d) result in the creation
or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for such contraventions, conflicts or
violations referred to in clause (b) or defaults, rights of termination,
cancellation or acceleration, or losses or Liens referred to in clause (c) or
(d) that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or be reasonably
likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Lien" means, with respect to any asset, any mortgage, lien,
pledge, charge, security interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect of
such     -11-   asset other than any such mortgage, lien, pledge,
charge, security interest or encumbrance (i) for Taxes (as defined in Section
3.13) not yet due or being contested in good faith (and for which adequate
accruals or reserves have been established on the Parent Balance Sheet or the
Company Balance Sheet, as the case may be) or (ii) which is a carriers\',
warehousemen\'s, mechanics\', materialmen\'s, repairmen\'s or other like lien
arising in the ordinary course of business. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company, nor to the knowledge of the Company, neither Joint
Venture (as defined in Section 3.23 herein) nor any of its Subsidiaries, is a
party to any agreement that expressly limits the ability of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company, or would limit Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent after the Effective Time, to compete in or conduct any line of
business or compete with any Person or in any geographic area or during any
period of time except to the extent that any such limitation, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have, or be reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   SECTION 3.5 Capitalization.

aggregate, would not have, or be reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company;   (c) liabilities disclosed in the Company
Commission Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement; and   (d)
liabilities under this Agreement.   SECTION 3.12 Litigation.  ---------- 
Except as disclosed in the Company Commission Documents filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, there is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the Company threatened
against or affecting, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or any of their respective officers or directors before
any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or be reasonably likely
to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   SECTION 3.13 Taxes. 
-----   (a) Except as set forth in the Company Balance Sheet (including
the notes thereto) and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have, or be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, (i) all Company Tax Returns required to be filed with any taxing
authority by, or with respect to, the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
filed in accordance with all applicable laws; (ii) the Company and its
Subsidiaries have timely paid all Taxes shown as due and payable on the
Company Tax Returns that have been so filed, and, as of the time of filing,
the Company Tax Returns correctly reflected the facts regarding the income,
business, assets, operations, activities and the status of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (other than Taxes which are being contested in good faith
and for which adequate reserves are reflected on the Company Balance Sheet);
(iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have made provision for all Taxes
payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for which no Company Tax Return
has yet been filed; (iv) the charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries reflected on the Company Balance
Sheet are adequate under GAAP to cover the Tax liabilities accruing through
the date thereof; (v) there is no action, suit, proceeding, audit or claim
now proposed or pending against or with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax where there is a reasonable possibility of
an adverse determination; and (vi) to the best of the Company\'s knowledge
and belief, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable for any
Tax imposed on any entity other than such Person, except as the result of the
application of Treas. Reg. section 1.1502-6 (and any comparable provision of
the tax laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction) to the affiliated
group of which the Company is the common parent. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Taxes" shall mean any and all taxes, charges, fees, levies or
other assessments, including, without limitation, all net income, gross
income, gross receipts, excise, stamp, real or personal property, ad valorem,
withholding, social security (or similar), unemployment, occupation, use,
production, service, service use, license, net worth, payroll,
franchise, severance, transfer, recording, employment, premium, windfall

value added, alternative or add-on minimum,     -17-   estimated or
other taxes, assessments or charges imposed by any federal, state, local or
foreign governmental entity and any interest, penalties, or additions to tax
attributable thereto. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Returns"
shall mean any return, report, form or similar statement required to be filed
with respect to any Tax (including any attached schedules), including,
without limitation, any information return, claim for refund, amended return
or declaration of estimated Tax.   (b) Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying or intended to qualify for tax-
free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to
the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution that could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.  
SECTION 3.14 Employee Benefit Plans.  -----------------------  (a) The
Company has provided Parent with a list (set forth in Section 3.14(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) identifying each material "employee benefit
plan", as defined in section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), each material employment, severance or
similar contract, plan, arrangement or policy applicable to any
director, former director, employee or former employee of the Company and
each material plan or arrangement (written or oral), providing for
compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock related
rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation
benefits, insurance coverage (including any self-insured arrangements),
health or medical benefits, disability benefits, workers\' compensation,
supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and post-employment or
retirement benefits (including compensation, pension, health, medical or life
insurance benefits) which is maintained, administered or contributed to by
the Company or any Subsidiary and covers any employee or director or former
employee or director of the Company or any Subsidiary, or under which the
Company has any liability; provided however, that such list need not include
any Company Benefit Plan that constitutes a Foreign Company Benefit Plan (as
defined below). The material plans, agreements or arrangements of the Company
and its Subsidiaries referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (a)
(excluding any such plan that is a "multiemployer plan", as defined in
section 3(37) of ERISA, but including Foreign Company Benefit Plans) are
referred to collectively herein as the "Company Benefit Plans." "Foreign
Company Benefit Plan" means any Company Benefit Plan of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United States. To the extent practicable, the Company shall provide and
deliver to Parent a list of Foreign Company Benefit Plans as soon as
practicable.   (b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established and
maintained in compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed
by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations (including but not
limited to, to the extent applicable, ERISA and the Code) which are
applicable to such Plan, except where failure to so comply would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have, or be reasonably likely to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.     -18-    (c) Neither the
Company nor any affiliate of the Company has incurred a liability under Title
IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that
presents a material risk to the Company or any affiliate of the Company of
incurring any such liability other than liability for premiums due the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have been paid
when due).   (d) Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be
qualified under section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been so
qualified during the period from its adoption to date, and each trust forming
a part thereof is exempt from federal income tax pursuant to section 501(a)
of the Code and, to the knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist
which will adversely affect such qualification or exemption.   (e) Section
3.14(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (a) with respect to
directors and officers of the Company as a group, the aggregate amount of all
severance and similar benefits, including enhanced or accelerated benefits,
to which such officers and directors will become entitled (including any
acceleration of vesting or lapse of repurchase rights or obligations
with respect to any Company Stock Option Plans or other benefit under
any compensation plan or arrangement of the Company), and (b) the aggregate
amount of all severance and similar benefits, including enhanced or
accelerated benefits, payable in cash or stock to which all other United
States payroll employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company
U.S. Employees") will become entitled, in each case, (i) solely as a result
of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval or the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) if a "second" trigger, including, but not
limited to, a termination for "good reason" or without "cause," is
applicable, assuming it has occurred (collectively, (i) and (ii) are
hereinafter defined as the "Benefit Triggers"). With regard to employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries other than the Company U.S. Employees (the
"Company Non-U.S. Employees"), there are severance pay plans (some legally
mandated and others Company designed) in many countries around the world
which provide severance payments in the event of termination. To the
knowledge of the Company, there are no severance agreements with respect to
the Company Non-U.S. Employees which provide enhanced severance on account
of a change in control which would be triggered by the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the aggregate
amounts for the Retirement Plan which will become vested upon a Change of
Control. This amount is based on the 1999 Actuarial Reports. In addition, the
comparable amounts for Supplement #1 and Supplement #3, calculated as of July
2000, are also disclosed. To the Company\'s knowledge, there are no other
retirement plans which require accelerated vesting solely due to the
transactions contemplated hereunder.   (f) Except as reflected in the
Company Commission Documents filed prior to the date hereof, no Company
Benefit Plan provides post-retirement health and medical, life or other
insurance benefits for retired employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   (g) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation
or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in, employee participation or coverage
under, any Company Benefit Plan (other than a Foreign Company Benefit Plan)
which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such    
-19-   Company Benefit Plan above the level of the expense incurred in
respect thereof for the 12 months ended on the Company Balance Sheet
Date.   (h) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable material federal, state and local laws,
rules and regulations respecting employment, employment practices, labor,
terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, including all civil
rights and anti-discrimination laws, rules and regulations
(collectively, "Anti-Discrimination Laws"), and no material work stoppage or
slowdown or labor strike against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or threatened, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries involved
in or threatened with labor disputes, grievances, or litigation relating to
labor matters, including with respect to Anti-Discrimination Laws, involving
classes or alleged classes of persons.   SECTION 3.15 Compliance with
Laws.  ---------------------  Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of, or has since January 1, 1998 violated, any
applicable provisions of any laws, statutes, ordinances or regulations except
for any violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have, or
be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  
SECTION 3.16 Finders\' or Advisors\' Fees.  -------------------------- 
Except for Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation and Morgan Stanley and
Co. Incorporated, copies of whose engagement agreements have been provided
to Parent, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who might be entitled to any fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 3.17 Environmental Matters.  ---------------------  
(a) Except as set forth in the Company Commission Documents filed prior to
the date hereof and with such exceptions as, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have, or be reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, (i) no notice, notification, demand, request
for information, citation, summons, complaint or order has been received by,
and no investigation, action, claim, suit, proceeding or review is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened by
any Person against, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no penalty
has been assessed against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, with respect to any matters relating to or arising out of any
Environmental Law; (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries are and have been in
compliance with all Environmental Laws; (iii) there are no liabilities of or
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or arising out
of any Environmental Law of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent,
absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, and there is no existing
condition, situation or set of circumstances which could reasonably be
expected to result in such a liability; and (iv) there has been no
environmental investigation, study, audit, test, review or other analysis
conducted of which the Company has knowledge in relation to any current or
prior business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any property or
facility now or previously owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries which has not been delivered to     -20-   Parent
prior to the date hereof.   (b) For purposes of this Section 3.17 and
Section 4.17, the term "Environmental Laws" means federal, state, local and
foreign statutes, laws (including, without limitation, common law), judicial
decisions, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders, codes,
injunctions, permits, governmental agreements or governmental restrictions
relating to human health and safety, the environment or to pollutants,
contaminants, wastes, or chemicals.   SECTION 3.18 Opinion of Financial
Advisor.  ----------------------------  The Company has received the opinion
of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation to the effect that, as of the date
of such opinion, the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, and as of the date hereof such
opinion has not been withdrawn.   SECTION 3.19 Pooling; Tax Treatment. 
-----------------------   (a) The Company intends that the Merger be
accounted for under the "pooling of interests" method under the requirements
of Opinion No. 16 (Business Combinations) of the Accounting Principles Board
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission.   (b) Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates has taken or
agreed to take any action or is aware of any fact or circumstance with
respect to the Company that would prevent the Merger from qualifying (i) for
"pooling of interests" accounting treatment as described in (a) above or (ii)
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code (a
"368 Reorganization").   (c) Immediately after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company will terminate all stock repurchase programs (provided
that the Company shall be permitted to effect the redemption contemplated by
Section 5.3).   SECTION 3.20 Pooling Letter.  ---------------  The Company
has received a letter from Arthur Andersen LLP dated as of October 15, 2000
and addressed to the Company, a copy of which has been delivered to Parent,
stating that Arthur Andersen LLP concurs with the Company management\'s
conclusion that, as of October 15, 2000, the Company is eligible
to participate in a transaction accounted for as a "pooling of interests"
under Opinion 16 (Business Combination) of the Accounting Principles Board of
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the rules and
regulations of the Commission.   SECTION 3.21 Takeover Statutes. 
------------------  The Board of Directors of the Company has taken the
necessary action to render section 203 of the Delaware Law, any other
potentially applicable antitakeover or similar statute or regulation and the
supermajority voting provisions of Article XIII of the Company\'s certificate
of incorporation and Article VII of the Company\'s by-laws inapplicable to
this Agreement and the Company Option Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.     -21-    SECTION 3.22 Stockholder
Rights Plan.  -------------------------  The Board of Directors of the
Company has resolved to, and the Company promptly after execution of this
Agreement will, take all action necessary to render the rights issued
pursuant to the terms of the Company Rights Agreement inapplicable to the
Merger, this Agreement, the Company Option Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   SECTION 3.23 Joint
Ventures.  ---------------  To the knowledge of the Company, the audited
consolidated financial statements of each of Equilon Enterprises LLC and
Motiva Enterprises LLC (the "Joint Ventures") for the years ended and at
December 31, 1999 and 1998 (including the notes thereto) previously furnished
by the Company to Parent present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the applicable Joint Venture as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and their cash flows
for the periods then ended, in each case in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto). To the
knowledge of the Company, neither Joint Venture nor any of its Subsidiaries
is subject to any liabilities of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued,

COVENANTS OF PARENT  ---------------------------------------------------  
Parent represents and warrants to the Company that (except as set forth in
the disclosure schedules delivered by Parent to the Company
simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure
Schedules")):   SECTION 4.1 Corporate Existence and Power. 
-------------------------------  Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to
carry on its business as now conducted, except for those the absence of which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or be reasonably likely to
have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or leased by it or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have, or be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Since the     -22-   date of its incorporation,
Merger Subsidiary has not engaged in any activities other than in connection
with or as contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has heretofore delivered to
the Company true and complete copies of Parent\'s and Merger Subsidiary\'s
certificate of incorporation and by-laws as currently in effect.   SECTION
4.2 Corporate Authorization.  -----------------------   (a) The execution,
delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement,
and by Parent of the Option Agreements, and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are
within the corporate powers of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, except for the required
approval of Parent\'s stockholders of (i) the Name Change Amendment (the
"Name Change Amendment Approval") and (ii) the issuance of Parent Common
Stock (the "Common Stock Issuance") in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the NYSE (the "Common Stock Issuance Approval", together
with the Name Change Amendment Approval, the "Parent Stockholder Approvals"))
in each case, in connection with the Merger. The affirmative vote of holders
of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock in
favor of the Name Change Amendment is the only vote of the holders of any of
the Parent\'s capital stock necessary in connection with obtaining the Name
Change Amendment. The affirmative vote in favor of the Common Stock Issuance
of a majority of the votes cast with respect to the Common Stock Issuance by
the holders of Parent Common Stock (provided that the total number of the
votes cast in favor of or against the Common Stock Issuance represents at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock) is the
only vote of the holders of any of Parent\'s capital stock necessary in
connection with obtaining the Common Stock Issuance Approval. Assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Option
Agreements by the Company, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and each Option Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent, in each case enforceable
against such party in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights and to
general equity principles. The shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant
to the Merger, when issued in accordance with the terms hereof, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
preemptive rights.   (b) Parent\'s Board of Directors, at a meeting duly
called and held on or prior to the date hereof, has (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Option Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (including the Merger) are fair to and in the best interests of
Parent\'s stockholders (and, in the case of the Name Change Amendment,
declaring its advisability), (ii) approved this Agreement and the Option
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including
the Merger and the Common Stock Issuance), and (iii) resolved (subject to
Section 6.4) to recommend approval by Parent\'s stockholders of the matters
constituting the Parent Stockholder Approvals.   SECTION 4.3 Governmental
Authorization.  ---------------------------  The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement, and by Parent
of the Option Agreements,     -23-   and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby require
no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency,
official or authority other than (a) the filing of a certificate of merger
and a certificate of amendment to Parent\'s certificate of incorporation, in
each case in accordance with Delaware Law, (b) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act, (c) compliance with any applicable requirements
of the EC Merger Regulation, (d) compliance with any applicable requirements
of laws, rules and regulations in other foreign jurisdictions governing
antitrust or merger control matters, (e) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, (f) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and (g) other actions or filings which if
not taken or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or be
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or prevent
or materially delay Parent\'s and Merger Subsidiary\'s consummation of the
Merger.   SECTION 4.4 Non-Contravention.  -----------------  The
execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this
Agreement, and by Parent of the Option Agreements, and the consummation
by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby do not and will not, assuming compliance with the matters referred to
in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, (a) contravene or conflict with the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, (b) contravene
or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any law,
regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon or applicable
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) constitute a default under or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right
or obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to a loss of any
benefit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any
provision of any agreement, contract or other instrument binding upon Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit or other similar
authorization held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (d) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for such contraventions, conflicts or violations
referred to in clause (b) or defaults, rights of termination, cancellation or
acceleration, or losses or Liens referred to in clause (c) or (d) that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or be reasonably likely to have,
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of
Parent is a party to any agreement that expressly limits the ability of
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to compete in or conduct any line of
business or compete with any Person or in any geographic area or during any
period of time except to the extent that any such limitation, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have, or be reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.   SECTION 4.5 Capitalization.  -------------- 
The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 2,000,000,000 shares
of Parent Common Stock, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$1.00 per share (of which 5,000,000 are designated Series A Participating

Stock outstanding set forth above) with respect to 1,475,291 shares of Parent
Common Stock. Except as set forth in this Section 4.5 and except for changes

enter into any such option, warrant, subscription or other right, convertible
security, agreement, arrangement or commitment (the items in clauses 4.5(a),
4.5(b) and 4.5(c) being referred to collectively as the "Parent Securities").
Except as required by the terms of any employee or director options or other
stock based awards and or as permitted by 6.1(e), there are no outstanding
obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Parent Securities.   SECTION 4.6 Subsidiaries.

existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, has all powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations,
permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now

Effect on Parent. Each Subsidiary of Parent is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the

consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements of Parent (including any related notes and schedules)
included in the annual reports on Form 10-K and the quarterly reports on Form

to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of notes in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements), in each case in conformity with GAAP

Absence of Certain Changes.  ---------------------------  Except as
disclosed in the Parent Commission Documents filed prior to the date of this

Sheet Date, Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice and there has not been:   (a)
any event, occurrence or development of a state of circumstances or facts
which, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would be
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent; or    
-27-    (b) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or

past practice) and (y) that are not special dividends), or any repurchase,
redemption or other acquisition by Parent or any of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries of any outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of, or other ownership interests in, Parent or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries (other than any such repurchases prior to the date
hereof pursuant to Parent\'s publicly announced stock buyback program or,
after the date hereof, as permitted under Section 6.1(e), or pursuant to the
terms of employee and director stock options); or   (c) any change prior to

reason of a concurrent change in GAAP; or   (d) any transaction or
commitment made, or any contract, agreement or settlement entered into, by
(or judgment, order or decree affecting) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to its assets or business (including the acquisition or disposition
of any assets) or any relinquishment by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of
any contract or other right, in either case, material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than transactions, commitments,
contracts, agreements or settlements (including without
limitation settlements of litigation and tax proceedings) in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, those contemplated by this
Agreement, or as agreed to in writing by the Company;   (e) any amendment
of any material term of any outstanding security of Parent or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries; or   (f) any (i) Tax election made or changed,

reasonably likely to result in a Tax liability material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.   SECTION 4.11 No Undisclosed Material
Liabilities.  --------------------------------------  There are no
liabilities of the Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent of any kind
whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable
or otherwise, other than:   (a) liabilities disclosed or provided for in the
Parent Balance  Sheet or in the notes thereto;   (b) liabilities which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not  have, or be reasonably likely to
have, a Material Adverse  Effect on Parent;   (c) liabilities disclosed in
the Parent Commission Documents filed  prior to the date of this Agreement;

Litigation.  ----------  Except as disclosed in the Parent Commission
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, there is no action,
suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of
Parent threatened against or affecting, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or

directors before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or
official except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or be
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   SECTION
4.13 Taxes.  -----  Except as set forth in the Parent Balance Sheet
(including the notes thereto) and except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have, or be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent, (i) all Parent Tax Returns required to be filed with any taxing
authority by, or with respect to, Parent and its Subsidiaries have been filed
in accordance with all applicable laws; (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries have
timely paid all Taxes shown as due and payable on Parent Tax Returns that
have been so filed, and, as of the time of filing, the Parent Tax Returns
correctly reflected the facts regarding the income, business, assets,
operations, activities and the status of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other
than Taxes which are being contested in good faith and for which adequate
reserves are reflected on the Parent Balance Sheet); (iii) Parent and its
Subsidiaries have made provision for all Taxes payable by Parent and its
Subsidiaries for which no Parent Tax Return has yet been filed; (iv) the
charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to Parent and its
Subsidiaries reflected on the Parent Balance Sheet are adequate under GAAP to
cover the Tax liabilities accruing through the date thereof; (v) there is no
action, suit, proceeding, audit or claim now proposed or pending against or
with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax where
there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination; and (vi) to
the best of Parent\'s knowledge and belief, neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is liable for any Tax imposed on any entity other than such
Person, except as the result of the application of Treas. Reg. section
1.1502-6 (and any comparable provision of the tax laws of any state, local or
foreign jurisdiction) to the affiliated group of which Parent is the common
parent.    SECTION 4.14 Employee Benefit Plans. 
----------------------   (a) Parent has provided the Company with a list
(set forth in Section 4.14(c) of the Parent Disclosure) identifying each
material "employee benefit plan," as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA, each
material management, consulting, non-compete, employment, severance or
similar contract, plan, arrangement or policy applicable to any director,
former director, employee or former employee of Parent and each material
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement (written or oral), providing
for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock
related rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation
benefits, insurance coverage (including any self-insured arrangements),
health or medical benefits, disability benefits, workers\' compensation,
supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and post-employment or
retirement benefits (including compensation, pension, health, medical or life
insurance benefits) or other employee benefits of any kind, whether funded or
unfunded which is maintained, administered or contributed to by Parent or any
Subsidiary and covers any employee or director or former employee or director
of Parent, or under which Parent or any Subsidiary has any liability,
contingent or otherwise; provided     -29-   however, that such list
need not include any Parent Benefit Plan that constitutes a Foreign Parent
Benefit Plan (as defined below). The material plans, agreement or
arrangements of the Parent and its Subsidiaries referred to in the first
sentence of this paragraph (a) (excluding any such plan that is
a "multiemployer plan," as defined in section 3(37) of ERISA, but
including Foreign Parent Benefit Plans) are referred to collectively herein
as the "Parent Benefit Plans." "Foreign Parent Benefit Plan" means any Parent
Benefit Plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that is governed by the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States. To the extent
practicable, Parent shall provide and deliver to the Company a list of
Foreign Parent Benefit Plans as soon as practicable.   (b) Each Parent
Benefit Plan has been established and maintained in compliance with its terms
and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules
and regulations (including but not limited to, to the extent applicable,
ERISA and the Code) which are applicable to such Plan, except where failure
to so comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or be
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (c)
Neither Parent nor any affiliate of Parent has incurred a liability under
Title IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk to Parent or any affiliate of
Parent of incurring any such liability other than liability for premiums due
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have been paid when
due).   (d) Each Parent Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified
under section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been so qualified
during the period from its adoption to date, and each trust forming a part
thereof is exempt from federal income tax pursuant to section 501(a) of the
Code and, to the knowledge of Parent, no circumstances exist which will
adversely affect such qualification or exemption.   (e) No director,
officer or other employee of Parent will become entitled to any severance or
similar benefit or enhanced or accelerated benefit solely as a result of
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval or otherwise as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (f) Except as reflected in the Parent
Commission Documents filed prior to the date hereof, no Parent Benefit Plan
provides post-retirement health and medical, life or other insurance benefits
for retired employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.   (g) There has
been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not
written) by Parent, any Subsidiary or any of its affiliates relating to, or
change in employee participation or coverage under, any Parent Benefit Plan
(other than a Foreign Parent Benefit Plan) which would increase materially
the expense of maintaining such Parent Benefit Plan above the level of the
expense incurred in respect thereof for the 12 months ended on the Parent
Balance Sheet Date.   (h) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable material federal, state and local
laws, rules and regulations respecting employment, employment practices,
labor, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, including
Anti-Discrimination Laws, and no material work stoppage or slowdown or labor
strike     -30-   against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending
or threatened, nor is Parent or any of its Subsidiaries involved in or
threatened with labor disputes, grievances or litigation relating to labor
matters involving any employees, including with respect to Anti-
Discrimination Laws, involving classes or alleged classes of persons.  
SECTION 4.15 Compliance with Laws.  ----------------------  Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of, or has since January 1, 1998
violated, any applicable provisions of any laws, statutes, ordinances or
regulations except for any violations that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have, or be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   SECTION 4.16 Finders\' or Advisors\' Fees. 
---------------------------  Except for Lehman Brothers Inc., whose fees will
be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries who might be entitled to any fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 4.17 Environmental Matters. 
----------------------   Except as set forth in the Parent Commission
Documents filed prior to the date hereof and with such exceptions as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have, or be reasonably likely to
have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (i) no notice, notification,
demand, request for information, citation, summons, complaint or order has
been received by, and no investigation, action, claim, suit, proceeding or
review is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
threatened by any Person against, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
penalty has been assessed against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, with respect to any matters relating to or arising out of any
Environmental Law; (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries are and have been in
compliance with all Environmental Laws; (iii) there are no liabilities of
or relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or arising out
of any Environmental Law of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent,
absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, and there is no existing
condition, situation or set of circumstances which could reasonably be
expected to result in such a liability; and (iv) there has been no
environmental investigation, study, audit, test, review or other analysis
conducted of which Parent has knowledge in relation to any current or prior
business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any property or facility now
or previously owned, leased or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
which has not been delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof.  
SECTION 4.18 Opinion of Financial Advisor.  ------------------------------ 
Parent has received the opinion of Lehman Brothers Inc. to the effect
that, as of the date of such opinion, the exchange ratio to be paid by Parent
in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent, and, as of
the date hereof, such opinion has not been withdrawn.   SECTION 4.19
Pooling; Tax Treatment.  ----------------------   (a) Parent intends that
the Merger be accounted for as a "pooling of interests" as described in
Section 3.19(a).   (b) Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has taken or
agreed to take any action or is     -31-   aware of any fact or
circumstance that would prevent the Merger from qualifying (i) for "pooling
of interests" accounting treatment as described in Section 3.19(a) or (ii) as
a 368 Reorganization.   (c) Immediately after execution of this Agreement,
Parent will terminate all stock repurchase programs.   SECTION 4.20 Pooling
Letter.  ---------------   Parent has received a letter from
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP dated as of October 15, 2000 and addressed to
Parent, a copy of which has been delivered to the Company, stating that based
on the information furnished to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in the related
certificate of Parent\'s management and based on the letter from Arthur
Andersen LLP referenced in Section 3.20, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP concurs
with Parent management\'s conclusion that, as of October 15, 2000, no
conditions exist that would preclude Parent\'s accounting for the Merger as a
pooling of interests, and such letter has not been withdrawn or modified in
any material respect as of the date hereof.   SECTION 4.21 Takeover
Statutes.  ------------------   The Board of Directors of Parent has (i)
taken the necessary action to render section 203 of the Delaware Law and any
other potentially applicable antitakeover or similar statute or regulation
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Parent Option Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (ii) has resolved to, and
promptly after the execution of this Agreement will, take the necessary
action to render the supermajority voting provisions of Article VII of
Parent\'s Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to this Agreement and the
Parent Option Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.   SECTION 4.22 Stockholder Rights Plan. 
------------------------   The Board of Directors of Parent has resolved to,
and Parent promptly after execution of this Agreement will, take all action
necessary to render the rights issued pursuant to the terms of the Parent
Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement, the Parent
Option Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.   ARTICLE 5  ---------  COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY 
------------------------   The Company agrees that:   SECTION 5.1 Conduct
of the Company.  -----------------------  From the date of this Agreement

is understood, will not limit the administration of the relevant plans
in accordance with past practices and interpretations of the Company\'s Board

Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Material. 
---------------------------------------------  Even if the Board of Directors
of Parent shall take any action permitted by the third sentence of Section
6.4, at such time at which Parent and the Company determine in their
reasonable judgment that, within 60 days, the Condition Satisfaction Time
will occur, the Company shall cause a meeting of its stockholders (the
"Company Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and held for the purpose of
voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger;
provided that the Company shall not hold the Company Stockholder Meeting, and
if the Company Stockholder Meeting has been called, the Company shall adjourn
the Company Stockholder Meeting, until such time (the "Condition Satisfaction
Time") at which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Company, all
conditions to the Closing (other than the condition set forth in Section
8.1(a)) have been satisfied or (to the extent legally permissible) waived (by
the applicable party) or are then capable of being satisfied, including by
placing the Alliance Interests into an irrevocable trust as contemplated by
Section 7.1(d)(iii), (assuming that all references to the Closing Date
contained in Sections 8.2(a) and 8.3(a) are deemed to be references to the
date of the Condition Satisfaction Time). Except as provided in the
next sentence, the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company\'s stockholders.
The Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted (i) not to recommend
to the Company\'s stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder
Approval or (ii) to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its
recommendation to the Company\'s stockholders that they give the Company
Stockholder Approval, only if (v) the Company has received a Superior
Proposal (defined in Section 7.10), (w) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of outside
legal counsel, that, in light of the Superior Proposal, failure to so
withdraw or modify its recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with fulfilling its fiduciary duty to stockholders under
applicable law, (x) five business days have elapsed following delivery by the
Company to Parent of written notice advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company has resolved to so withdraw or modify
its recommendation, specifying the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making the Superior Proposal,
(y) the Company has given Parent the opportunity to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement in response to the Superior Proposal and negotiated
in good faith with Parent with respect to the proposed revisions, if any, and
(z) the Company has complied with its obligations set forth in Section 7.10
in all material respects; provided, however, that in the case of (i) and (ii)
above, the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement and the Merger to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for approval at the Company
Stockholder Meeting unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms prior to the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting. In connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company (i)
will prepare and file with the Commission, will use its reasonable best
efforts to have cleared by the Commission the Company Proxy Statement and all
other materials for the Company Stockholder Meeting, and (ii) will mail to

SECTION 6.2 Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. 
----------------------------------  Parent will take all action necessary to
cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.   SECTION 6.3 Director and Officer Liability. 
------------------------------   (a) Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were officers,
directors and employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Indemnitees") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided
under the Company\'s certificate of incorporation and by-laws in effect on
the date hereof. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all
indemnification agreements with Indemnitees (including under the Company\'s
by-laws) in effect as of the date hereof in accordance with the terms
thereof. The Company has disclosed to Parent all such indemnification
agreements prior to the date hereof.   (b) For six years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall procure the provision of officers\' and directors\'
liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such Person currently covered by the Company\'s
officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy on terms with respect
to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof; provided, that if the aggregate annual premiums
for such insurance at any time during such period shall exceed 300% of the
per annum rate of premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof for such insurance, then Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide only such coverage as shall then be available at an
annual premium equal to 300% of such rate.   (c) The obligations of Parent
under this Section 6.3 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.3 applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.3 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.3).   SECTION 6.4 Parent Stockholder
Meeting;  --------------------------  Form S-4. Even if the Board of
Directors of the Company shall take any action permitted by the third
sentence of Section 5.2, Parent shall cause a meeting of its stockholders
(the "Parent Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and held for the purpose
of approving the matters constituting the Parent Stockholder Approvals;
provided that the Parent Stockholder Meeting shall conclude prior to the
Company Stockholder Meeting and may be held on the same date as the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Except as provided in the next sentence, the Board of
Directors of Parent shall recommend approval of the matters   
-39-   constituting the Parent Stockholder Approvals. The Board of
Directors of Parent shall be permitted (i) not to recommend to Parent\'s
stockholders that they give the Parent Stockholder Approvals or (ii) to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company its recommendation to
the Parent\'s stockholders that they give the Parent Stockholder Approval,
only if (v) Parent has received a Superior Proposal, (w) the Board of
Directors of Parent determines, after receiving the advice of outside legal
counsel, in its good faith judgment that, in light of the Superior Proposal,
failure to so withdraw or modify its recommendation would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with fulfilling its fiduciary duty to stockholders
under applicable law, (x) five business days have elapsed following delivery
by Parent to the Company of written notice advising the Company that the
Board of Directors of Parent has resolved to so withdraw or modify
its recommendation, specifying the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making the Superior Proposal,
(y) Parent has given the Company the opportunity to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement in response to the Superior Proposal and negotiated
in good faith with the Company with respect to the proposed revisions, if
any, and (z) Parent has complied with its obligations set forth in Section
7.10; provided, however, that in the case of (i) and (ii) above, Parent shall
nevertheless submit the matters constituting the Parent Stockholder Approvals
to Parent\'s stockholders for approval at the Parent Stockholder Meeting
unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms
prior to the date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting. In connection with the
Parent Stockholder Meeting, Parent (i) will promptly prepare and file with
the Commission, will use its reasonable best efforts to have cleared by the
Commission, (ii) will mail to its stockholders the Parent Proxy Statement and
all other proxy materials for such meeting a sufficient time prior to the
Parent Stockholder Meeting as is necessary to comply with applicable laws
including the rules and regulations of the Commission, (iii) will use its
reasonable best efforts, subject to the immediately preceding sentence, to
obtain the Parent Stockholder Approvals, and (iv) will otherwise comply with
all legal requirements applicable to the Parent Stockholder Meeting. Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file
with the Commission under the Securities Act the Form S-4, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Form S-4 to be declared effective by the
Commission a sufficient time prior to the Parent Stockholder Meeting to allow
the Company and Parent to mail the Company Proxy Statement or Parent Proxy
Statement, as applicable, to their respective stockholders, as required by
applicable laws, including the rules and regulations of the Commission, prior
to the meeting of their respective stockholders. Parent shall take any action
required to be taken under foreign or state securities or Blue Sky laws in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Merger.   SECTION 6.5 Stock Exchange Listing.  ------------------------ 
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be listed
on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.   SECTION 6.6 Employee
Benefits.  -----------------   (a) From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with
their terms all benefits and obligations, subject to Section 6.6(b) hereof,
under the Company Benefit Plans, each as in effect on the date hereof (or as
amended     -40-   with the prior written consent of Parent), to the
extent that entitlements or rights, actual or contingent (whether such
entitlements or rights are vested as of the Effective Time or become vested
or payable only upon the occurrence of a further event, including a
discretionary determination) exist in respect thereof as of the Effective
Time. Parent and the Company hereby agree that the consummation of the Merger
shall constitute a "Change in Control" for purpose of any employee
arrangement and all other Company Benefit Plans, pursuant to the terms of
such plans in effect on the date hereof, provided, however, to the extent
consistent with Section 7.4, that the Board of Directors of the Company will
take all actions necessary so that the consummation of the Merger and related
transactions hereunder will not create additional funding obligations
on behalf of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
the Company Stock Grantor Trust. No provision of this Section 6.6(a) shall
be construed as a limitation on the right of Parent to amend or terminate
any Company Benefit Plans which the Company would otherwise have under the
terms of such Company Benefit Plan, and no provision of this Section 6.6(a)
shall be construed to create a right in any employee or beneficiary of such
employee under a Company Benefit Plan that such employee or beneficiary would
not otherwise have under the terms of such Company Benefit Plan; provided,
however, the Parent agrees that it will respect deferrals of salary, bonus or
other compensation in place prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
Company Benefit Plans. Parent acknowledges that the Company\'s Separation Pay
Plan by its terms provides that benefits thereunder are vested on the day
immediately prior to a change of control.   (b) Following the Effective
Time, Parent shall continue to provide to individuals who are employed by the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remain employed
with Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent ("Affected Employees"), for so long
as such Affected Employees remain employed by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent, employee benefits (i) pursuant to the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements as
provided to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii)
pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements
maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent providing coverage and
benefits which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those
provided to employees of Parent in positions comparable to positions held by
Affected Employees with Parent or its Subsidiaries from time to time after
the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall continue to
provide to former employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (and to
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose employment terminates
prior to the Effective Time) ("Affected Retirees") post-retirement benefits
(other than pensions) (i) pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans applicable to
such Affected Retirees, each as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or
(ii) pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements
maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent providing post-retirement
coverage and benefits (other than pensions) which, in the aggregate, are no
less favorable than those provided to former employees of Parent.   (c)
Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Affected
Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual (including benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plans, provided that a participant\'s benefit under any such defined benefit
pension plan may be offset by such participant\'s accrued benefit under the
Company defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plans or
arrangements maintained by     -41-   Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent for such Affected Employees\' service with the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company to the same extent recognized by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (d) Parent will, or will cause
the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees under any welfare
benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained for the Affected
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each
Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time.    ARTICLE 7  --------- 
COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY  -----------------------------------  
The parties hereto agree that:   SECTION 7.1 Best Efforts. 
------------   (a) Subject to Sections 5.2, 6.4, 7.1(b), 7.1(c) and 7.1(d),
Company and Parent shall each cooperate with the other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective best efforts to
promptly (i) take or cause to be taken all necessary actions, and do or cause
to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement
and applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable,
including, without limitation, preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any third
party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, the Company and Parent shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult the other on, all the information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears
in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any governmental authority in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Without limiting Section
7.1(a), Parent and the Company shall subject to Sections 7.1(c) and 7.1(d),
as applicable:     -42-    (i) Each use its best efforts to avoid the
entry of, or to  have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment
that would  restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the End Date
(as  defined in Section 9.1(b)(i)), including without limitation defending 
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any 
Person; and   (ii) each use its best efforts to avoid or eliminate each
and  every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation 
law that may be asserted by any governmental authority with respect to  the
Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably  possible
(and in any event no later than the End Date), including,  without
limitation, (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and  effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the  sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent  or the Company (or any of
their respective Subsidiaries) and (y)  otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that after the Closing  Date would limit Parent or its
Subsidiaries\' freedom of action with  respect to, or its ability to retain,
one or more of its or its  Subsidiaries\' businesses, product lines or
assets, in each case as may  be required in order to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the  dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order,
or other  order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect  of preventing or materially delaying the Closing.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of this
Section 7.1 shall not be construed to require either party to undertake
any efforts or to take any action if such efforts or action would, or
would reasonably be expected to, result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, at or after the Effective Time; provided,
further, that any requirement to divest or hold separate, or limit in any
material respect the operations of the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (prior to Closing) involving the refining, marketing or
transportation of petroleum products in the Western United States, other than
with respect to insignificant operations of such business shall be deemed for
purposes of this Section 7.1(c) and Sections 8.1(d), 8.1(i), 8.1(j), 8.1(k)
and 8.1(l) to result in a Material Adverse Effect.   (d) (i) The parties
anticipate that there will be objections  raised by the United States Federal
Trade Commission or the  Antitrust Division of the United States Department
of Justice to the  combination of Parent\'s United States downstream
operations  with the Company\'s interests in the Joint Ventures 
(collectively, the "Alliance Interests"). The parties will  jointly determine
how to address any objections promptly and  the Company will, subject to
Section 7.4 and in consultation  on an ongoing basis with Parent, negotiate
one or more  definitive agreements responsive to the regulatory 
requirements (each, an "Alliance Transaction Agreement")  and shall promptly
inform Parent of all material  developments in the negotiations. The Company
shall be  permitted to enter into any Alliance Transaction Agreement  only
with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent  shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   (ii) In the event the Company shall not have
entered into an  Alliance Transaction Agreement fifteen days prior to the
scheduled date  of the Company    -43-    Stockholder Meeting, the
Chairman of Parent and the  Chairman of the Company shall meet to discuss the
status of such  efforts by the Company.   (iii) If the stockholders of the
Company, at the Company  Stockholder Meeting (which shall not take place
prior to the Condition  Satisfaction Time), approve and adopt the Merger and
the Merger  Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, then, immediately upon
the  conclusion of such meeting, the parties shall consummate the Closing. 
If the utilization of the Trust Agreement, described below, is required  in
order to meet immediately any remaining conditions to Closing, the  Company
shall cause all of the then outstanding capital stock of the  Subsidiary or
the Subsidiaries of the Company which own the Alliance  Interests, and such
other assets as Parent and the Company shall agree,  to be placed into an
irrevocable trust pursuant to an Agreement and  Declaration of Trust (the
"Trust Agreement") substantially in the form  of Annex 7.1 to this Agreement,
with only such changes as are (x)  required by any governmental body, agency,
official or authority or (y)  mutually agreed by Parent, the Company and the
Trustees. For purposes  of this Section 7.1(d), "Trustees" shall mean those
Persons selected  jointly by Parent and the Company to serve as the trustees
under the  Trust Agreement.   SECTION 7.2 Certain Filings. 
----------------  The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (a)
in connection with the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement, the Parent
Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, (b) in determining whether any action by or
in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official, or
authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(c) in seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with
the Company Proxy Statement, the Parent Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers.   SECTION 7.3 Access to Information.  ---------------------- 
From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Company and Parent will upon
reasonable request give the other party, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access to the
offices, properties, books and records of such party and its Subsidiaries
during normal business hours, furnish to the other party, its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such
financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may
reasonably request and will instruct its own employees, counsel and financial
advisors to cooperate with the other party in its investigation of the
business of the Company or Parent, as the case may be; provided that no
investigation of the other party\'s business shall affect any representation
or warranty given by either party hereunder. All information obtained by
Parent or the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be kept confidential
in accordance with, and shall otherwise be subject to the terms of, the
Confidentiality Agreement dated February 5, 1999 between Parent and
the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement").     -44-    SECTION 7.4
Tax and Accounting Treatment.  -------------------------------  Neither
Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall they permit their Subsidiaries to
take, any action, and Parent and the Company shall not, and shall ensure that
its Subsidiaries do not, fail to take any action which action or failure to
act would prevent, or would be reasonably likely to prevent, the Merger from
qualifying (a) for "pooling of interests" accounting treatment as described
in Section 3.19(a) or (b) as a 368 Reorganization.   SECTION 7.5 Public
Announcements.  ---------------------  Parent and the Company will consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any press release or make any public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any press release or
public statement as may be required by applicable law or any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange may be issued prior to such
consultation, if the party making the release or statement has used
its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party.   SECTION 7.6
Further Assurances.  -------------------  At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
any other actions and do any other things, in the name and on behalf of the
Company or Merger Subsidiary, reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.   SECTION 7.7 Notices of
Certain Events.  -------------------------   (a) Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly notify the other party of:   (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging  that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection  with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and   (ii) any notice or other communication from any
governmental  or regulatory agency or authority in connection with the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) The Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other party of any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to the best of its knowledge
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such
party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 7.8 Affiliates. 
----------   (a) Not less than 45 days prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company (i) shall have delivered to the other party a letter
identifying all Persons who, in the opinion of    -45-   the party
delivering the letter, may be, as of the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting or Parent Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, its "affiliates" for
purposes of SEC Accounting Series Releases 130 and 135 and/or, in the case of
the Company, for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, and (ii)
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who is identified
as an "affiliate" of it in such letter to deliver, as promptly as practicable
but in no event later than 30 days prior to the Closing (or after such later
date as the Parent and the Company may agree) to Parent in the case of
affiliates of Parent, a signed agreement substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit C-1, and in the case of affiliates of the Company,
substantially in the forms attached as Exhibits C-2 and C-3. Each of Parent
and the Company shall notify the other party from time to time after the
delivery of the letter described in Section 7.8(a)(i) of any Person not
identified on such letter who then is, or may be, such an "affiliate" and use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each additional Person who is identified
as an "affiliate" to execute a signed agreement or agreements as set forth in
this Section 7.8(a).   (b) Shares of Parent Common Stock and shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by each such "affiliate" of Parent or
Company who has not provided a signed agreement or agreements, as applicable,
in accordance with Section 7.8(a) shall not be transferable during any period
prior to and after the Effective Time if, as a result of this transfer during
any such period, taking into account the nature, extent and timing of this
transfer and similar transfers by all other "affiliates" of Parent and the
Company, this transfer will, in the reasonable judgment of accountants of
Parent, interfere with, or prevent the Merger from being accounted for, as a
"pooling-of-interests" under GAAP and/or the rules and regulations of the
SEC. Neither Parent or the Company shall register, or allow its transfer
agent to register, on its books, any transfer of any shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock of any affiliate of Parent or the Company who
has not provided a signed agreement in accordance with Section 7.8(a) unless
the transfer is made in compliance with the foregoing.   SECTION 7.9
Payment of Dividends.  ----------------------  From the date hereof until
the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will coordinate with each other
regarding the declaration of dividends in respect of the shares of Parent
Common Stock and the shares of Company Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that
holders of shares of Company Common Stock will not receive two dividends, or
fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to
their shares of Company Common Stock and the shares of Parent Common Stock
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock receives in exchange therefor in
connection with the Merger.   SECTION 7.10 No Solicitation. 
---------------   (a) Each of Parent and the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries will not, and Parent and the Company will direct and use their
respective best efforts to cause their and their Subsidiaries\' respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys,
accountants, agents and other representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
take any action to solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate the making of
any Acquisition Proposal (including without limitation by amending, or
granting any waiver under, the Parent Rights Agreement or the Company Rights
Agreement, as applicable) or any inquiry with respect thereto   
-46-   or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect thereto, or disclose any nonpublic information or afford access to
properties, books or records to, any Person that has made, or to such
party\'s knowledge, is considering making, any Acquisition Proposal. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of Parent or
the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that the Board of Directors of such
party shall not recommend that the stockholders of such party tender their
shares in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer except to the
extent that, after receiving a Superior Proposal, such Board of Directors of
such party determines in its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice
of outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, failure
to make such a recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with fulfilling the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to such
party\'s stockholders under applicable law and such party shall have complied
with the procedure set forth in Section 5.2 or 6.4, to the extent applicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the date
of approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders of Parent or
the Company, as applicable, Parent or the Company may (A) furnish information
and access to a third party, but only in response to a request for
information or access, to any Person making an Acquisition Proposal to the
board of directors of Parent or the Company, as applicable, after the date
hereof which was not knowingly encouraged, solicited or initiated by
Parent or the Company, as applicable, or any of its affiliates or any
director, employee, representative or agent of Parent or the Company, as
applicable, or any of its respective Subsidiaries (including, without
limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by Parent
or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) on or after the date hereof and
(B) may participate in discussions and negotiate with such Person concerning
any such Acquisition Proposal, if and only if, in any such case set forth in
clause A or B of this paragraph, (i) the Board of Directors of Parent or
Company, as applicable, concludes in good faith, after receipt of the advice
of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal with respect to Parent or the Company, as applicable, (ii)
the Company or Parent, as applicable, complies with all of its obligations
under this Agreement, and (iii) the board of directors of Parent or the
Company, as applicable, receives from the Person making such an Acquisition
Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement the material terms of which
are (without regard to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal) in all
material respects (x) no less favorable to the Company or Parent, as
applicable, and (y) no less restrictive to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.   (b) Any
party receiving an Acquisition Proposal will (A) promptly (and in no event
later than 48 hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal) notify (which
notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall identify the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal and set forth the material terms thereof)
the other party to this Agreement after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal,
any indication of which such party has knowledge that any Person
is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for
nonpublic information relating to such party or any Subsidiary of such party
or for access to the properties, books or records of such party or any
Subsidiary of such party by any Person that has made, or to such party\'s
knowledge may be considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, and (B) will
keep the other party to this Agreement informed of the status and material
terms of (including all changes to the    -47-   status or material
terms of) any such Acquisition Proposal or request. Each of Parent and the
Company (x) shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, accountants, agents and other
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all
discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken place prior to the date
hereof with any Persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (y)
shall promptly request each Person, if any, that has executed a
confidentiality agreement within the 9 months prior to the date hereof in
connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.   For purposes of this
Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide written offer or
proposal for, or any written indication of interest in, any (i) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of any business or assets of Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that, individually or in the
aggregate, constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets
of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of any class of equity securities of
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of such
party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning
20% or more of any class of equity securities of Parent or the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more
the net revenues, net income or assets of such party and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (iv) merger, consolidation, business combination, joint
venture, partnership, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenue, net
income or assets of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
(a) with respect to Parent, an offer or proposal shall not be deemed an
Acquisition Proposal if (x) the execution of agreement with respect to, and
consummation of, the transaction contemplated thereby would not be reasonably
likely to prevent the Parent and Merger Subsidiary from consummating the
Merger or to materially delay Parent\'s or Merger Subsidiary\'s ability to
consummate the Merger and (y) execution of an agreement with respect to the
transaction contemplated thereby is not prohibited by Section 6.1, or, if the
execution of such agreement would be prohibited by Section 6.1, such an
agreement will not be entered into until after the provisions contained in
Section 6.1 are no longer in effect and (b) with respect to the Company, any
offer or proposal for the disposition by the Company of the Alliance
Interests shall not be deemed to be an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal for or in respect of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock, or Parent Common Stock, as applicable (i) on terms
that the Board of Directors of Parent or the Company, as
applicable, determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with,
and taking into account the advice of, a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation) are more favorable from a
financial point of view to its stockholders than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) that    -48-   constitutes a
transaction that is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set
forth, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects
of such proposal.   (c) Each of the Company and Parent agrees that it will
take the necessary steps promptly to inform its Subsidiaries and its
officers, directors, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, accountants,
agents and other representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 7.10.   SECTION 7.11 Letters from Accountants.

Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the rules and regulations of
the Commission is appropriate if the Merger is closed and consummated in

the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the rules and
regulations of the Commission.   SECTION 7.12 Takeover Statutes. 
-----------------  If any anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation is

hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on    -49-   the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.   SECTION 7.13 Headquarters.  ------------  After
