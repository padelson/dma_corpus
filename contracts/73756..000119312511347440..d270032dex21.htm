Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation and performance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



   10.6 | No knowledge of breach

any of the Sellers Warranties untrue, save to the extent that such fact,
circumstance or matter is disclosed in the Disclosed Information.

 



   10.7 | No other warranties 
---|--- 

Except for the warranties set forth above in this Clause 10, the Buyer does
not make any express or implied warranty in respect of the sale and purchase
of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement provided however, that background law
shall apply to such extent that it does not prevent claims made due to gross
negligence, wilful default or fraud of the Buyer. The Sellers hereby
acknowledge that they are not relying on any warranties or representations of
the Buyer other than those specifically contained in this Agreement.



   11 | COMPENSATION 
---|--- 



   11.1 | Compensation by the Sellers 
---|--- 

The Sellers shall be liable to compensate the Buyer or the Company Group from
and against any foreseeable net loss ("Loss") which the Buyer or the Company
Group may suffer due to any breach of any of the Sellers Warranties or any
covenant or other obligation of the Sellers contained herein. The Sellers
liability under this Agreement shall be several and not joint.

 



22 ---|--- 

The Buyers right to compensation or other remedy shall not extend to matters
which were fairly disclosed in the Disclosed Information or which were
otherwise known or should have been known, to the Buyer prior to entering
into this Agreement.



   11.3 | Financial limits 
---|--- 

The maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers for breach of the Sellers
Warranties or any covenant or other obligation of the Sellers under this
Agreement shall, unless otherwise set forth herein, be subject to the
following limitations:

 



   a) | the Sellers shall have no liability with respect to any single
Loss which does not exceed an amount equal to 0.1% of the Purchase Price; 
---|--- 
 



   b) | the Sellers shall have no liability unless all the Losses, subject
to any restrictions made under this Clause 11, exceed an amount equal to NOK
10,000,000 of the Purchase Price (the "Basket Amount"), and shall then only
be liable for the exceeding amount; and 
---|--- 



   c) | other than breach of the warranties set out in Clause 9.1 and 9.4,
first paragraph the Sellers total liability under this Agreement shall in no
event exceed an amount equal to 25% of the Purchase Price. The aggregate
liability of the Seller for Losses pursuant to Articles 9.1 and 9.4, first
paragraph shall not exceed the Purchase Price. 
---|--- 
 



   11.4 | Time limits 
---|--- 

The Sellers shall have no liability with respect to any claim unless the
Buyer notifies the Sellers in writing, together with a reasonable
specification of the basis for the claim:



   a) | within 30 days from the date when the Buyer became aware that a
claim could be brought; and 
---|--- 
 



   b) | in any event no later than 31 March 2013, other than with respect
to claims based on breach of Clauses 9.20 and 9.9, which must be notified in
writing to the Sellers as set forth above no later than 15 December 2014 with
respect claims under Clause 9.20 and 15 December 2016 with respect to claims
under Clause 9.9. 
---|--- 
 



   11.5 | Matters reflected in the Locked Box Accounts and Leakages 
---|--- 

The Buyer shall not be entitled to make any claim to the extent that a
provision or allowance for the matter (whether as a specific reserve or as a
general reserve) has been made in the statement of financial position as of
the Locked Box Date included in the Locked Box Accounts.

The liability of the Sellers pursuant to Clause 3.3 is the Buyers sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to Leakages.



   11.6 | Related benefits 
---|--- 

In assessing any damages or other amounts payable in respect of a Loss there
shall be taken into account any related savings (including tax savings) or
other net benefits which become available to the Buyer or the Company Group.

 



23 ---|--- 

For the purposes of this Agreement, a liability which is contingent shall not
constitute a Loss and the Sellers shall not become liable in respect thereof
unless and until such contingent liability becomes an actual liability and is
due and payable. For the avoidance of doubt, any contingent liability
notified within the time limits set out in clause 11.4 will suspend the time
limitations therein, subject to such contingent liability being sufficiently
specified in order for the Sellers to assess the merit of such liability.



   11.8 | Changes in law, accounting bases etc 
---|--- 

No liability shall arise if and to the extent any claim:



   a) | occurs as a result of any change in law or practice of any
Governmental Body occurring after the date hereof, whether or not the change
takes effect retrospectively;  
---|--- 



   b) | occurs as a result of any increase in any Tax rate in force on the
date hereof or any change in the generally established practice of the
relevant Tax authorities; or  
---|--- 



   c) | has arisen as a result of any change after the Locked Box Date in
the accounting bases, policies or methods applied in preparing any accounts or
valuing the assets or liabilities of the Group from those used in preparing
the Locked Box Accounts. 
---|--- 



   11.9 | Covered Losses 
---|--- 

The Sellers shall not be liable for any Loss to the extent the Loss:



   a) | is covered by insurance in force on the date of this Agreement for
the benefit of the Buyer, AGR Group or Company Group or which would have been
covered by insurance equivalent to that maintained by the Sellers immediately
prior to the date hereof; or 
---|--- 
    
--- 
   b) | if and to the extent the Buyer or the Company Group has any other
right of recovery or to claim indemnity from any person other than the Sellers
whether under any provision of applicable law, contract or otherwise, but
only if and to the extent the Buyer or the Company Group receives payment from
such third party after having taken reasonable steps to recover payment from
such persons before making a claim against the Sellers. 
---|--- 



   11.10 | Acts of the Buyer; Mitigation 
---|--- 

The Sellers shall not be liable for any Loss to the extent the Loss would not
have arisen but for an act, omission or transaction actionable under
applicable law or regulation carried out by the Buyer or its affiliates
(provided that the Buyer should reasonably have known that such act, omission
or transaction (or the continuation thereof) would give rise to such a claim)
or the Buyers omission of mitigating its loss according to applicable law,
save, in each case, for any act, omission or transaction required by the
Buyer or any Group Company by any obligation existing prior to the date of
this Agreement or required by law or regulation.



   11.11 | Compensation procedure with respect to Third Party Claims 
---|--- 



    _11.11.1_  | _Notice of Third Party Claim_ 
---|--- 

If the Buyer or any of the Group Companies receives notice of any Third Party
Claim, the Buyer shall give the Sellers prompt written notice of such Third
Party Claim.

 



24 ---|--- 



   a) | The Sellers shall at their sole discretion and at their own cost
and expense have the right to assume and control the defence (and any possible
settlement) of the Third Party Claim, using professional advisors of the
Sellers choice, provided however, that any settlement (i) requiring part
fulfilment by the Buyer or any of the Group Companies or (ii) including an
admission of any liability or responsibility on behalf of the Buyer or any
Group Company, or (iii) including or being reasonably be expected to have any
material sanction, material restriction or material adverse effect on or
change to the business, properties, financial condition or results of
operations of the Buyer or any Group Company after the Closing Date will
require the approval by the Buyer (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld). 
---|--- 
 



   b) | If the Sellers decides to assume control over the defence as set
out in a) above, the Sellers shall automatically assume responsibility for the
potential liability that becomes the result of the Third Party Claim and
shall indemnify the Buyer and the Group Companies in respect of all such
liability. 
---|--- 



   c) | In any event, no Third Party Claim shall be settled by the Buyer
without the written consent of the Sellers (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), provided, however, that in the event the Sellers have
not assumed the control over the defence of a Third Party Claim, the Buyer may
inform the Sellers in writing of a proposed settlement of such Third Party
Claim and may, unless the Sellers confirm that they assume the control over
the defence of such Third Party Claim within five (5) Business Days following
receipt of such notice, settle such Third Party Claim on the terms and
conditions set forth in such notice. The Sellers shall have no obligation to
compensate the Buyer for any Losses resulting from settlement of Third Party
Claims by the Buyer or any Group Company after Closing in violation of the
provisions of this Clause 11.11. 
---|--- 
 



    _11.11.3_  | _Cooperation_ 
---|--- 

In order to enable the Sellers to defend any Third Party Claim or to decide
what steps or proceedings should be taken in order to do so, so long as the
Sellers are performing their obligations of defence the Buyer shall give the
Sellers or their duly authorised representatives reasonable access to the
personnel of the Buyer and the Group Companies, and to any items, accounts,
documents and records which are relevant to such Third Party Claim and are
within the power, possession or control of the Buyer or any of the Group
Companies ("relevant material") to enable the Sellers and its duly authorised
representatives to investigate the Third Party Claim and to examine and take
copies or photographs of the relevant material at their own expense.



   12 | SPECIFIC INDEMNITIES 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding Clause 9 and as an exclusive remedy with respect to the
matters described in this Clause 12, the Sellers undertake to indemnify and
hold the Buyer and the Company harmless from and against any and all Losses
incurred by the Buyer or the Company Group as a result of:



   (i) | any Tax incurred by the Company Group resulting from the
implementation of the demerger plan dated 30 June 2008 regarding the demerger
of AGR Holdings AS which has not been paid or which is not provided for in
the Financial Statements or the Locked Box Accounts, provided, however, that
the Sellers shall have no liability under this Clause 12(i) unless the Buyer
informs the Sellers about the claim in writing without delay, and in no event
no later than on or before 15 December 2016; or 
---|--- 
 



25 sharing agreement and the Tax funding agreement between AGR Asia Pacific Pty

under this Clause 12(ii) unless the Buyer informs the Sellers about the claim
in writing without delay, and in no event no later than on or before 15
December 2016; and 
---|---

---|--- 



   13.1 | Termination 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be terminated, and transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Closing Date:



   a) | by mutual written consent of the Sellers and the Buyer; 
---|--- 



   b) | by either Party, if Closing has not occurred (other than through
the fault of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement) on or before 31
January 2012 or such later date as the Parties may agree upon in writing. 
---|--- 



   13.2 | Rights on termination 
---|--- 

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Clause 13.1, all further
obligations of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate without
further liability of a Party to the other, provided, however, that the
obligations of the Parties contained in Clauses 14 (Confidentiality), 16.4
(Costs), 16.6 (Notices), 16.10 (Governing law), 16.11 (Dispute resolution),
and 16.12 (Waiver of immunity) shall survive such termination; and further

obligations under this Agreement, the terminating Partys right to pursue all
legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.



   14 | CONFIDENTIALITY 
---|--- 

The Parties agree that the content of this Agreement as well as any and all
other information which has been or will be delivered or disclosed (whether
orally or in writing) to the other Party in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereby, including any disclosures after the Closing Date

unless the Party disclosing or delivering such information has confirmed in
writing that the relevant information is non-confidential or non-proprietary.
The Party receiving confidential information shall treat, and shall cause its
officers, directors, employees, advisors and

 



26  auditors to treat, such information as strictly confidential and shall not

except if and to the extent:

 



   a) | such disclosure is required by law or regulation, including stock
exchange rules, and for the avoidance of doubt the Buyer acknowledges in this

transaction contemplated hereby pursuant to sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the
continuing obligations of companies listed on Oslo Børs; 
---|--- 



   b) | by any order of any administrative or judicial authority or other
legal process (provided that disclosure in any instance contemplated by this
paragraph b) or the foregoing paragraph a) shall not by itself permit
disclosure in any other instance); 
---|--- 



   c) | such information has become public through no fault of the
receiving Party; or 
---|--- 
 



   d) | such information has been obtained separately by the receiving
Party from a third party that is not bound by any obligation of

of the date hereof or at any time thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall restrict or preclude the Sellers from hiring any such
employee of the Company Group who responds to a general advertisement of
employment which is placed in the ordinary course of business or who first
initiates an employment discussion with the Sellers, so long as the Sellers
have not violated the restrictions on solicitation contained in
this Agreement.

The Buyer hereby agrees that it will not and will cause any company
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Buyer (the "Buyer
Group") not to, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment: (i) for a

with the Buyer Group, so long as the Buyer Group has not violated the
restrictions on solicitation contained in this Agreement.
