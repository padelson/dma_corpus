3.2(b)    viii      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of September 28, 2003 among
MANULIFE FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the laws of
Canada ("Parent"), JOHN HANCOCK FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC., a corporation
organized under the laws of Delaware (the "Company"), and JUPITER MERGER
CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware and a direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Co.").   W I T N E S S E T H:  
WHEREAS, each of the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Co. and
the Company has approved, and deemed it advisable and in the best interests
of its shareholders, in the case of Parent, and stockholders, in the case of
Merger Co. and the Company, to consummate, the business
combination transaction provided for herein in which Merger Co. would merge
with and into the Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, in furtherance of such business
combination, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Co. and the Company
have each approved and declared advisable this Agreement providing for the
Merger in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Co. and the Company
intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"); and   WHEREAS, Parent
and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe conditions
to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   Section 1.1 Effective Time of Merger.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") shall be duly prepared, executed by the Company and
thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for
filing, as provided in the DGCL, as soon as practicable following the
Closing. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
time thereafter as is agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company and
provided in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").     
Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date that is two business days
after satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Laws) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the
Closing Date but subject to satisfaction or waiver of such conditions)
set forth in Article VII, or at such other time or date as agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto (the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held
at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York 10017, or at such other place as agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.   Section 1.3 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective
Time, Merger Co. shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
existence of Merger Co. shall cease. The Merger will have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. As used in this Agreement, "Constituent Corporations"
shall mean each of Merger Co. and the Company, and, subject to Section 1.6,
"Surviving Corporation" shall mean the Company or, as provided in Section
1.6, Merger Co., at and after the Effective Time, as the surviving
corporation in the Merger.   Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and
By-Laws. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Company or, if Merger Co. is the Surviving Corporation, Merger Co., as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended so as to read
in its entirety in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, and, as so amended,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Laws. If the Company is the
Surviving Corporation, it shall take all requisite action such that, at the
Effective Time, the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so
as to read in their entirety in the form of the by-laws of Merger Co. as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.   Section 1.5 Surviving
Corporation Officers and Directors. The Company or, if Merger Co. is the
Surviving Corporation, Merger Co., shall take all requisite action such that,
immediately following the Effective Time, (a) the officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (b) the directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
those Persons that are the directors of the Company on the date hereof (other
than any such Persons who cease to be directors prior to the Effective Time),
any Persons appointed or elected to the Board of Directors of the Company
after the date hereof that Parent agrees may serve on the Board of Directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Dominic D. D\'Alessandro. In addition, it is
contemplated that an individual who is a member of the board of directors of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time will join the board
of directors of the Surviving Corporation at the time of the appointment of
the Parent director referred to in the first sentence of Section 6.14(b).  
Section 1.6 Alternative Structure. In lieu of Merger Co. being merged with
and into the Company, Parent shall have the right to irrevocably elect by
written notice given to the Company, and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, to cause the "Merger" to be a
merger of the Company with and into Merger Co. at the Effective Time, in
which case, following the "Merger", the separate corporate existence of the
Company shall cease and Merger Co. shall continue as the Surviving
Corporation; provided that (i) such change shall not delay the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby in any respect and (ii) such
change shall not affect the Merger Consideration to be received by the  
2    stockholders of the Company or the qualification of the "Merger" as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code or
otherwise prejudice the Company, its stockholders or, with respect to Section
6.9, any third party beneficiary thereof or in any other way affect the
corporate governance structure of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that such change
is to be effected, Parent, the Company and Merger Co. shall, subject to the
foregoing, take any action necessary to permit the provisions of this Article
I to be effective and shall make such other changes that are necessary to be
made to reflect the change in the structure that has occurred, to the extent
it does not prejudice the Company or its stockholders.   ARTICLE II 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE  CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of any shares of the Company Common Stock:   (a) Cancellation of
Treasury Stock. All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Common Stock") that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no common
shares of Parent (the "Parent Common Shares") or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.   (b) Conversion of the Company Common
Stock. Subject to Section 2.3, each share of the Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to
be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(a) and shares (other than shares
held in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held,
directly or indirectly, in a fiduciary, nominee or custodial capacity that
are beneficially owned by third parties (including shares held by mutual
funds)) that are owned by Parent, Merger Co. or any other wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent, which shall be canceled at the Effective Time and shall
cease to exist) shall be converted into the right to receive 1.1853 (the
"Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Shares (together
with any cash paid in respect of fractional shares in accordance with Section
2.3, the "Merger Consideration"). Upon such conversion, all such shares of
the Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in respect of such shares upon the surrender of the Certificate representing
such shares in accordance with Section 2.2.   (c) Merger Co. Capital Stock.
All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Co. ("Merger
Co. Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
collectively, shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of redeemable preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.   3     (d) Issuance of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock. In exchange for, and in consideration of, (i) the
issuance of Parent Common Shares as part of the Merger Consideration for the
benefit of Merger Co. pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the payment of $10
by Parent to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will issue
to Parent, at the Effective Time, 1,000 fully paid and nonassessable shares
of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.   Section 2.2 Surrender and Payment. (a) Parent shall appoint
an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging certificates
which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company
Common Stock (the "Certificates") for the Merger Consideration. As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration to be exchanged or paid in
accordance with this Article II. Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b), promptly after the Effective Time
but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following the Effective
Time, (i) a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall,
prior to the Effective Time, be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and the Company and shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title in respect of the Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent)
and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for the Merger Consideration.   (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or
Certificates, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal
covering such shares and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, shall be entitled to receive as promptly as practicable
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock. The holder of such Certificate, upon its delivery thereof to the
Exchange Agent, shall also receive any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Certificates
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled as of the Effective Time. Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate, following the Effective Time,
shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c).  
(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the Parent Common Shares such holder is entitled to receive
until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2. Subject to applicable
Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole Parent Common Shares
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with respect to such whole
Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time and a
payment date prior to such surrender.   4     (d) If any certificate
for Parent Common Shares is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition to the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required as a result of the issuance of a certificate
for Parent Common Shares in any name other than that in which the Certificate
is registered, or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Person" means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a
partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or organization,
including a government or political subdivision or any agency
or instrumentality thereof.   (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificate formerly representing shares of
Company Common Stock is presented to the Surviving Corporation, it shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
Article II.   (f) None of Parent, Merger Co., the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or affiliates shall be liable to any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.   (g) The Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, and from any cash
dividends or other distributions that the holder is entitled to receive under
Section 2.2(c), such amounts as the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of United States ("U.S.")
federal, state or local tax Laws, Canadian federal or provincial tax Laws or
any other non-U.S. tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such
amounts withheld from the Merger Consideration and other such amounts payable
under Section 2.2(c) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been received by the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent.   (h) Any portion of the
certificates evidencing the Parent Common Shares, the cash to be paid in
respect of fractional shares and the cash or other property in respect of
dividends or other distributions supplied to the Exchange Agent which remains
unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock six months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged his shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.2 prior to the time of
demand shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), in each case, without interest.   5     Section 2.3
Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing less than one Parent
Common Share shall be issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
upon the surrender for exchange of a Certificate. In lieu of any such
fractional share, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share upon
surrender of Certificates for exchange shall be paid upon such surrender (and
after taking into account and aggregating shares of Company Common Stock
represented by all Certificates surrendered by such holder) cash (without
interest) in U.S. dollars in an amount equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account and aggregating all shares of Company Common Stock
represented by all Certificates surrendered by such holder) would otherwise
be entitled by (b) the closing price for a Parent Common Share on the New
York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") trading session on the last trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Time.   Section 2.4 Lost, Stolen or
Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration and any dividends
or other distributions as may be required pursuant to this Article II in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   Section 2.5 Options and
Other Company Stock Awards. (a) At and after the Effective Time: (i) the
Company shall take all requisite action such that, at the Effective Time, all
options granted by the Company to purchase shares of the Company Common Stock
(each, a "Company Option") and all other awards based on Company Common Stock
(collectively with the Company Options, the "Company Stock Awards") which
have been granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan and are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into and become,
(x) with respect to Company Options, options to purchase Parent Common Shares
(each, a "Parent Option") and (y) with respect to all other Company Stock
Awards, awards based on Parent Common Shares (collectively with the Parent
Options, the "Parent Share Awards"), and in each case, shall be assumed by
Parent on the same terms as those in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (after giving effect to the occurrence of the Merger)
under the terms of the stock incentive plan or other agreement or award
pursuant to which such Company Stock Award was granted (collectively, such
plans, agreements and awards being hereinafter referred to as the "Company
Stock Plans"), and the applicable Company Stock Plan shall, to the extent
necessary, be amended to reflect such assumption by Parent.   (ii) The
Company shall take all requisite action such  that, at and after the
Effective Time, (A) each Company Option assumed  by Parent as provided in
subparagraph (i) above may be exercised solely  to purchase Parent Common
Shares, (B) the number of Parent Common  Shares purchasable upon exercise of
such Parent Option shall be equal  to the number of shares of the Company
Common Stock that were  purchasable under the corresponding assumed Company
Option immediately  prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio, and  rounded downward to the nearest   6    whole share, (C) the
per share exercise price for the Parent Common  Shares issuable upon exercise
of such Parent Options shall be equal to  the quotient of (x) the per share
exercise price of Company Common  Stock for which each corresponding assumed
Company Option was  exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by (y) the  Exchange Ratio, which quotient shall be rounded upward to
the nearest  whole cent and (D) the number of Parent Common Shares, which
will  become subject to all other Parent Share Awards as provided in 
subparagraph (i) above, shall be determined by multiplying the number  of the
shares of Company Common Stock subject to each corresponding  assumed Company
Stock Award outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, and rounded downward to the  nearest whole share.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of  Parent Common Shares subject
to, and the per share exercise price of,  each Parent Option which is by its
terms intended to be an "incentive  stock option" (as defined in Section 422
of the Code) shall be  determined in accordance with the provisions in the
preceding sentence,  subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to
satisfy the  requirements of Section 424 of the Code. Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  the parties may agree prior to the Effective Time to provide
for  alternative equitable treatment of Company Options whose per share 
exercise price would be, following the application of the conversion  into
Parent Options in accordance herewith, greater than the per share  trading
price of Parent Common Shares.   (iii) The Company shall take all requisite
action such  that, at the Effective Time, all Company Stock Awards that are
shares  of restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock 
Plans ("Restricted Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective
Time (including any restricted Company Common Stock granted  under the
Company Stock Plans in accordance with Section 5.1(j) of this  Agreement)
shall be converted into Parent Common Shares ("Parent  Restricted Shares") in
accordance with Section 2.1(b), which Parent  Restricted Shares shall, at and
after the Effective Time (after giving  effect to the occurrence of the
Merger), be governed by the same terms  and conditions as those in effect
immediately prior to the Effective  Time under the relevant Company Stock
Plan.   (b) The Company shall take all requisite action such that, at and
after the Effective Time, all amounts credited to an account under any
incentive compensation or deferred compensation plan of the Company or
other agreement with the Company (collectively, the "Deferred Compensation
Plans"), which are invested in deferred stock units of the Company or
restricted deferred stock units of the Company (each, a "Company DSU"), shall
be deemed invested in a number of deferred stock units (or restricted
deferred stock units, as applicable) based on Parent Common Shares (each, a
"Parent DSU") equal to the product of (i) the number of the Company DSUs into
which any amounts deferred under the applicable Deferred Compensation Plans
were deemed invested immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, which product shall be rounded to the nearest whole share (a
half or less share shall be rounded downward). At and after the Effective
Time, such Parent DSUs shall be governed by the same terms and conditions as
those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect
to the occurrence of the Merger) under the relevant Deferred Compensation
Plan pursuant to which such amounts had been invested in Company DSUs,
including, without limitation, the requirement that the Company DSUs be
payable only in cash.   7     (c) In connection with the provisions of
this Section 2.5, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to, cooperate with the Company and take all requisite action to
effectuate the foregoing. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
but no later than five business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to the holders of Company Stock Awards appropriate notices setting
forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, Parent
Options, Parent Restricted Shares and other Parent Share Awards (including
(i) that, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Plans,
the Merger constitutes a "Change in Control" (or "Change of Control", as
applicable) (as either such term is defined in each applicable Company Stock
Plan), (ii) the effect of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Company
Stock Plans or the Company Stock Awards, (iii) that the agreements evidencing
the grants of such Company Stock Awards shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions and (iv) that holders of Parent Options shall continue
to be entitled to exercise such options and receive Parent Common Shares
deliverable thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof). Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares for delivery upon
exercise of the Parent Options or in connection with Parent Restricted
Shares, other Parent Share Awards or any other assumed Company Stock Plan for
which Parent Common Shares are required to be reserved for issuance. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall have filed and caused to
become effective a registration statement on Form F-3 or Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate forms), or any other appropriate form under
the Securities Act with respect to the Parent Common Shares subject to such
Parent Options, other Parent Share Awards, assumed Company Stock Plans or any
interest in any assumed Company Stock Plan for which registration of Parent
Common Shares or plan interests are required, deliver to holders of Parent
Options any applicable prospectus and use its best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses associated
therewith) for so long as such Parent Options remain outstanding or for so
long as the relevant assumed Company Stock Plans remain in effect.   (d)
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all steps that would be
required to cause any acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual
who (i) would be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or (ii) at or within six months
after the Effective Time would become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, in each case if, (A) Parent were not a "Foreign Private Issuer"
within the meaning of Rule 3b-4(c) under the Exchange Act and (B) the Persons
specified above were to assume their applicable positions at the Effective
Time.   Section 2.6 Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, (i) the outstanding Parent Common
Shares or the Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number of shares or different class
of stock, in each case, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split, reverse stock-split, split-up, combination or exchange of
shares, (ii) a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities
shall be declared with a record date within such period, (iii) an issuer
tender offer or exchange offer shall have been effected by Parent in breach
of Section 5.2(b)(ii) or (iv) any shares of capital stock of the Company
shall have been issued pursuant to the Company Rights Agreement, the Exchange
Ratio and Merger Consideration shall   8    be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of the Company Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company represents and
warrants to Parent except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed
prior to the date hereof and (ii) the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to Parent concurrently herewith (the "Company Disclosure Schedule")
(each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation
and warranty; provided that any disclosure contained in any section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall qualify each other representation and
warranty where it would be reasonably apparent that it should be an exception
to such representation or warranty or be disclosed on such other section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule) as follows:   Section 3.1 Organization,
Standing and Power; Subsidiaries. (a) The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware, has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business
and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties or assets makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so organized, existing, in good standing, licensed or qualified
or have such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, copies of which were
furnished to Parent, are true, complete and correct copies of such documents
as in effect on the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the
term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to any entity, any
material adverse change or effect on the financial condition, properties,
assets (including, without limitation, intangible assets), businesses or
results of operations of such entity and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
provided, however, that (i) the following shall not be deemed to have a
Material Adverse Effect: a change or effect (A) relating to the
U.S., Canadian or global economy or securities markets in general, (B)
relating to the insurance industry or other financial services industries in
which such entity or its Subsidiaries operate in general which does not have
a materially disproportionate effect on such entity or its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole (relative to most industry participants), (C) proximately caused
by the announcement of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or (D) relating to changes in Laws or US GAAP, Canadian GAAP or SAP after the
date hereof, and (ii) a decrease in the trading or market prices of an
entity\'s capital stock shall not be considered, by itself, to constitute a
Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that the foregoing shall not
prevent any party from asserting that any change or effect that may have
contributed to such reduction independently constitutes a Material Adverse
Effect).   (b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a complete and correct list of all of the Company\'s Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof (other than inactive Subsidiaries with no material liabilities)
and indicates, as to each such Subsidiary that is not, directly
or indirectly, wholly-owned as of the date hereof, the authorized capital of
such   9    Subsidiary, the number and type of outstanding shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of such Subsidiary, and as to each
Subsidiary, any issued and outstanding options, warrants, stock appreciation
rights, rights to subscribe to, calls, rights of first offer, rights of first
refusal or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities
or rights convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, shares of any
capital stock or other equity securities of such Subsidiary, and any
contracts, commitments, instruments, understandings or arrangements by which
such Subsidiary may be or become bound to issue additional shares of its
capital stock or other equity securities, or options, warrants or rights to
purchase, acquire, subscribe to, calls on, or rights of first offer, rights
of first refusal or commitments for, any shares of its capital stock or other
equity securities and the identity of the parties to any such agreements or
arrangements. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
securities evidencing ownership of the Company\'s Subsidiaries have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are, to the extent they are corporations
organized under Laws of the U.S. or Canada, fully paid and non-assessable
with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof, and such
shares or other securities that are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries
are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries free and clear of any lien,
claim, charge, option, encumbrance, mortgage, pledge or security interest, in
each case, whether arising by contract, operation of Laws or otherwise
(a "Lien"), with respect thereto except for (1) any buy or sell arrangements
(x) applicable to Subsidiaries that are not "significant subsidiaries" within
the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act
("Significant Subsidiaries") and (y) that are not material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and (2) provisions in partnership
agreements and limited liability company agreements permitting third parties
to remove the Company or its Subsidiary as a general partner or managing
member. Each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries (A) is a duly organized and
validly existing corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other
legal entity under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (B) has all
requisite corporate or other entity power and authority to own, lease and
operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, and (C) is duly licensed or qualified to do business
and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership or leasing of its properties or assets makes such licensing
or qualification necessary, other than, in each case, in those jurisdictions
where the failure to be so organized, existing, licensed or qualified or
failure to have such power, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
"Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any corporation or
other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, (x) of which such
party or any other subsidiary of such party is a general partner of a
partnership or a managing member of a limited liability company (other than
any entity whose principal purpose and activity is making passive investments
(irrespective of organizational form, an "Investment Vehicle")) or (y) at
least a majority of the securities or other interests of which having
by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such party or by any one or more of its subsidiaries, or by
such party and one or more of its subsidiaries (unless such entity is an
Investment Vehicle).   Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
provides a complete and accurate list, as of the date hereof, of all
partnership and limited liability company investments held by the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company that are not, directly or indirectly, wholly-
owned by the Company as of the date hereof, except for interests in
Investment Vehicles   10    and passive investments made by the Company
or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. The Company has
provided or made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of all
partnership or limited liability company or similar agreements relating to
such entities to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a
party.   Section 3.2 Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of
the Company consists of 2,000,000,000 shares of the Company Common Stock
and 500,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the

Company and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent thereunder (the
"Company Rights Agreement"). All outstanding shares of the Company Common
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
non-assessable and not subject to preemptive or similar rights. The shares of
the Company Common Stock which may be issued upon exercise of the Company
Options have been duly authorized and, if and when issued pursuant to the
terms thereof, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
not subject to preemptive or similar rights.   (b) No bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote, or being convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for any securities having the right to
vote, on any matters on which stockholders may vote ("Voting Debt") of the
Company are issued or outstanding.   (c) Except for (i) this Agreement,
(ii) the Company Options, (iii) the Company Stock Awards (other than Company
Options), (iv) agreements with respect to Subsidiary stock solely between the
Company and wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Company or solely between or
among wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Company and (v) the Company Rights, as
of the date hereof, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which it or any such Subsidiary is
bound obligating the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any shares of
capital stock or any Voting Debt (or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock of Voting Debt)
of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or obligating the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any such option,
warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. Except for the Company Rights
Agreement and the Company Stock Plans, there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or pursuant to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is or could be required to register shares of
the Company   11    Common Stock or any other securities under the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Securities Act"), or under the securities Laws of any
non-U.S. jurisdiction. A list of each holder of a Company Stock Award, the
number of shares subject to such award, and, with respect to Company Options,
the exercise price per share and the number of shares subject to unexercised
Company Options, in each case, as of September 23, 2003, has been delivered
to Parent prior to the execution hereof. None of the shares of Company Common
Stock are held, directly or indirectly, by any Subsidiary of the Company,
except for shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a
fiduciary, nominee or custodial capacity that are beneficially owned by third
parties, including shares held by mutual funds for which any Subsidiary of
the Company acts as an investment adviser ("Company Trust Account
Shares").   Section 3.3 Authority. (a) The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and,
subject to adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Vote, to

Documents when filed contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary

the Company included in the Company SEC Documents complied as to form, as of

accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, including all applicable requirements pursuant to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the financial statements included therein have

disclosed therein) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations, changes in
stockholders\' equity and cash flows of such companies as of the dates and
for the periods shown.   (c) Except for (i) those liabilities that are
fully reflected or reserved for in the consolidated balance sheet of the

required to be reflected in the Company\'s financial statements in accordance
with US GAAP).   (d) As of the date hereof, no "material contract" (as such
term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)
filed as an exhibit to the Company Annual Report has been amended
or modified, except for such material amendments or modifications which have
been filed as an exhibit to a subsequently dated Company SEC Document which
has been filed prior to the date of this Agreement.   14     (e) The
Company is in compliance in all material respects with (A) the applicable

any of its affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material way)
personal loans to any executive officer or director of the Company.   (f)
The Company (i) has designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of the Company by others within
those entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to the Company\'s auditors and the audit committee
of the Company\'s Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in any

report financial data and has identified for the Company\'s auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company\'s internal controls. The Company has made available to
Parent a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the Company\'s
auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2002.   Section 3.5 Insurance
Reports. Each of the Subsidiaries through which the Company conducts its
material insurance operations (collectively, the "Company Insurance
Entities") is listed in Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each
of the Company Insurance Entities has filed all annual and quarterly
statements, together with all exhibits, interrogatories, notes, schedules and
any actuarial opinions, affirmations or certifications or other supporting
documents in connection therewith, required to be filed with or submitted to
the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities of the jurisdiction in which
it is domiciled or commercially domiciled on forms prescribed or permitted by
such authority (collectively, the "Company SAP Statements"), except for such
failures to file that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws, copies of all of the Company SAP Statements for each Company Insurance
Entity for the periods beginning January 1, 2001 and through the date hereof,
each in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto)
filed with the applicable state insurance regulatory authority and true and
complete copies of all examination reports of insurance departments and any
insurance regulatory authorities received by the Company (to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws in respect of the Company Insurance Entities
incorporated in Canada) on or after January 1, 2001 and through the date
hereof relating to the Company Insurance Entities. Financial statements
included in the Company SAP Statements and prepared on a statutory basis,
including the notes thereto, were prepared in conformity with
statutory accounting practices ("SAP") prescribed or permitted by the
applicable insurance regulatory authority, in each case, consistently applied
for the periods covered thereby and present fairly the statutory financial
position of the relevant Company Insurance Entity as at the respective dates
thereof and the results of operations of such Company Insurance Entity for
the respective periods then ended. The Company SAP Statements complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations when filed,
and no material deficiency has been asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to any Company SAP Statements. Except as indicated therein,  
15    all assets that are reflected as admitted assets on the Company SAP
Statements comply with all applicable foreign, federal, state and local
statutes and regulations regulating the business and products of insurance
and all applicable orders and directives of insurance regulatory authorities
(collectively, the "Insurance Laws") with respect to admitted assets, as
applicable, and are in an amount at least equal to the minimum amounts
required by Insurance Laws, except for such failures to comply or failures to
be at least equal to minimum amounts that individually or in the aggregate,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The statutory balance sheets and
income statements included in the Company SAP Statements have been audited by
the Company\'s independent auditors, and the Company has delivered or made
available to Parent true and complete copies of all audit opinions related
thereto for periods beginning January 1, 2001.   Section 3.6 Permits;
Compliance with Applicable Laws. (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have
all permits, concessions, grants, licenses (including insurance licenses),
franchises, variances, exemptions, declarations and approvals ("Permits")
required for the operation of their respective businesses or the operation,
ownership and leasing of their respective properties and assets, except for
such Permits the failure of which to have, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or materially impair or materially delay the ability of the Company
to perform its obligations hereunder (the "Company Permits"). The business of
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been and is being conducted in
compliance with the terms of all of the Company Permits, except for such
instances of noncompliance which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
materially impair or materially delay the ability of the Company to perform
its obligations hereunder. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company
or materially impair or materially delay the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations hereunder, all of the Company Permits are in
full force and effect, and there is no proceeding or investigation pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened which would reasonably be
expected to lead to the revocation, amendment, failure to renew, limitation,
suspension or restriction of any such Permit.   (b) Since January 1, 2001,
the businesses of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and the
ownership, leasing and operation of the properties and assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, have not been conducted in violation of any laws,
statute, ordinance, code, regulation, rule, judgment, order, decree, writ,
directive, injunction, arbitration award, decision or ruling of, any
Governmental Entity ("Laws"), except for any violations which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or materially impair or materially delay the
ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder. No
investigations or reviews by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company
or materially impair or materially delay the ability of the Company
to perform its obligations hereunder are pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened. Except as set forth in its statutory reports filed
prior to the date hereof, and except as required by Laws of general
applicability and the insurance permits, grants or licenses maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, there are no written agreements, memoranda of
understanding, commitment letters or similar undertakings binding on the
Company or its Subsidiaries to which the Company   16    or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, on one hand, and any Governmental Entity is a party
or addressee, on the other hand, or orders or directives by, or supervisory
letters from, any Governmental Entity specifically with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which (A) limit the ability of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue life insurance policies or
annuity contracts, (B) require any investments of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to be treated as nonadmitted assets, (C) require any divestiture
of any investments of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (D) in any
manner relate to the capital adequacy (including the maintenance of any
National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Insurance Regulatory
Information System Ratio, reserves or surplus), credit policies or management
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the ability of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to pay dividends or other distributions or (E)
otherwise restrict the conduct of business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any material respect.   (c) Except where the failure to do
so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of the Company, its insurance agents,
solicitors, third party administrators, managers, brokers and distributors,
have marketed, sold and issued insurance, reinsurance and annuity products in
compliance with all applicable Laws governing sales processes and
practices.   (d) Section 3.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list of each of the material memberships, as of
the date hereof, of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in
securities exchanges, commodities exchanges, boards of trade and clearing
organizations.   Section 3.7 Insurance Business. (a) All policies,
binders, slips, certificates, guaranteed insurance contracts, annuity
contracts and participation agreements and other agreements of insurance,
whether individual or group, in effect as of the date hereof (including all
applications, supplements, endorsements, riders and ancillary documents in
connection therewith) that are issued by a Company Insurance Entity
(collectively, the "Company Insurance Contracts"), and any and all marketing
materials are, to the extent required under applicable Insurance Laws, on
forms and at rates approved by the insurance regulatory authority of the
jurisdiction where issued or, to the extent required by applicable Laws, have
been filed with and not objected to by such authority within the period
provided for objection, except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   (b) A true and complete copy of each of the actuarial reports
referred to in Section 3.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule has been
made available to Parent prior to the date hereof (the "Company
Actuarial Analyses"). There have been no actuarial reports of a similar
nature covering any of the entities referred to in those reports in respect
of any period subsequent to the latest period covered in the Company
Actuarial Analyses. To the knowledge of the Company, the information and data
furnished by the Company or any Company Insurance Entity to its independent
actuaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Actuarial
Analyses were accurate in all material respects for the periods covered in
the Company Actuarial Analyses.   17     (c) Each Company Insurance
Entity to which the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and
the regulations promulgated thereunder (including 45 C.F.R. parts 160, 162
and 164) (collectively, "HIPAA") are applicable has formulated and, as of the
date hereof, is in the process of implementing a remediation plan or plans
designed to ensure compliance by such Company Insurance Entity, (i) by no
later than October 16, 2003, with the applicable Administrative
Simplification provisions of HIPAA and (ii) by no later than the applicable
mandated compliance dates, with any applicable state or federal privacy laws
or regulations (including HIPAA) governing the privacy of health information.
These remediation plans, as in effect on the date hereof, are referred to
collectively as the "Company HIPAA/Privacy Remediation Plan". The Company
HIPAA/Privacy Remediation Plan is based upon reasonable determinations
concerning: (i) the application of HIPAA and other state and federal privacy
laws and regulations to each Company Insurance Entity and (ii) the measures
that must be taken to attain compliance with such laws and regulations by
their mandated compliance dates. The Company reasonably believes as of the
date hereof that the objectives set forth in the Company
HIPAA/Privacy Remediation Plan are attainable in the manner and within the
time periods set forth therein (which time periods have been established to
ensure full compliance by the applicable compliance dates imposed by HIPAA
and other applicable state and federal privacy laws and regulations).  
Section 3.8 Reserves. The aggregate reserves of the Company Insurance
Entities as recorded in the Company SAP Statements have been determined in
all material respects in accordance with generally accepted actuarial
principles consistently applied (except as set forth therein). All reserves
of the Company Insurance Entities set forth in the Company SAP Statements are
fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles and meet the
requirements of all applicable Insurance Laws including the applicable SAP,
except where the failure to so state such reserves or meet such requirements,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 3.9 Separate Accounts. (a)
Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each separate account
created under the federal laws of the U.S. or the laws of a U.S. state and
maintained by a Company Insurance Entity (a "Company Separate Account") is
duly and validly established and maintained under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and is either excluded from the definition of an
investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), or
is duly registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (i) each such Company
Separate Account, if not registered, is operated and all of its operations
are conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws, and (ii) each such
Company Separate Account, if registered, is operated in compliance with the
Investment Company Act, has filed all reports and amendments of its
registration statement required to be filed, and has been granted
all exemptive relief necessary for its operations as presently conducted.  
(b) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, the Company
Insurance Contracts under which the Company Separate Account assets are held
are duly and validly issued and are   18    either exempt from
registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 3(a)(2), 3(a)(8) or
4(2) of the Securities Act or were sold pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, and each such registration statement is
currently in effect to the extent necessary to allow the appropriate Company
Insurance Entity to receive contributions under such policies.   (c) The
assets of each Company Separate Account that are subject to the provisions of
Section 817(h) of the Code are adequately diversified within the meaning of
Section 817(h) of the Code, except where the failure to be so treated would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (d) Each of the Company Insurance
Entities incorporated or organized under the Laws of the U.S. or any state
thereof is treated for U.S. federal tax purposes as the owner of the assets
underlying the respective life insurance policies and annuity contracts
issued, entered into or sold by it, except where the failure to be so
treated, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 3.10 Bank
Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary of the Company that is (a) a bank (as defined
in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"), or (b)

and its Subsidiaries conduct broker-dealer operations solely through
the Subsidiaries of the Company listed in Section 3.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, all of which are organized and resident under the Laws
of the U.S., Canada or any province or state thereof (collectively, the
"Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries"), which includes a listing of all such
registrations and licenses held by such Subsidiaries with all applicable U.S.
and Canadian Governmental Entities and an indication as to whether such
Subsidiary is a member in good standing of the National Association of
Securities Dealers Inc. (the "NASD") or other U.S. or Canadian broker-dealer
associations (and, if so, a listing of each such association). No other
Subsidiary of the Company is required by the nature of its activities to be
so registered under the Exchange Act or under the laws of any state or other
U.S. or Canadian jurisdiction or to be a member in good standing of the NASD
or other broker-dealer associations under any other applicable Laws. The
Company has filed and made available to Parent, in the form as filed, a true
and complete copy of each such Subsidiary\'s form registering such Subsidiary
as a broker-dealer with the SEC (a "Form BD") that is effective as of the
date hereof. The information contained in such forms and reports was (or will
be, in the case of filings made after the date hereof) true and complete as
of the time of filing, except where the failure to be true and complete,
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (b) Each of the Company Broker-
Dealer Subsidiaries is duly registered and licensed as a broker-dealer under
the Exchange Act and under any state, federal or foreign broker-dealer or
similar laws pursuant to which each such Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary

Agreement, except as disclosed on an SEC Form BD which has been filed by each
Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement, no Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, nor any of its officers,
directors or employees, has been convicted of any crime or has been the
subject of any disciplinary proceedings or orders of any Governmental Entity,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such disciplinary proceeding or
order is pending or threatened; and no Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, nor
any persons affiliated with such Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any of such Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary\'s
officers, directors or employees of any of the foregoing or any "associated
person" (as defined in the Exchange Act) of such Company Broker-Dealer
Subsidiary, is or has been subject to any disqualification that would be a
basis for denial, suspension or revocation of registration of a broker-dealer
under Section 15, 15B or 15C of the Exchange Act.   (c) Each Company
Broker-Dealer Subsidiary satisfies the minimum net capital requirements of
the Exchange Act and of the laws of any jurisdiction in which such Company
Broker-Dealer Subsidiary conducts business, except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.   Section 3.12 Investment Adviser Subsidiaries; Funds;
Clients. (a) The Company and certain of its Subsidiaries (the "Company
Advisory Entities") provide investment management, investment advisory and
sub-advisory services (including management and advice provided to separate
accounts and participation in wrap fee programs). The Company Advisory
Entities, as of the date hereof, providing investment advisory services in
the U.S. or Canada are listed on Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure

each Contract for such services provided by a Company Advisory Entity;
"Company Advisory Client" means each party to a Company Advisory Contract
other than the applicable Company Advisory Entity; "Company Fund Client"
means each Company Advisory Client that is registered as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act; and "Sponsored" means, when used
with reference to any Company Fund Client or Parent Fund Client, a Company
Fund Client or Parent Fund Client, as the case may be, a majority of the
officers of which are employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or of which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, holds itself out as the sponsor. Each Sponsored Company Fund
Client (or the trust of which it is a series) is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction
of organization, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Boards of
Trustees or directors of the Sponsored Company Fund Clients (or the trust of
which it is a series) operate in conformity with Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the
Investment Company Act.   (b) Each of the Sponsored Company Fund Clients is
in compliance with all applicable Laws of the SEC, the NASD, the IRS and any
other Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over such Sponsored Company
Fund Client or its distributor or investment adviser and of any required
state or other jurisdiction in which such Sponsored Company Fund Client is
registered, qualified or sold and with its prospectus and any required
statement of additional information, except for such instances of
noncompliance which, individually or in the aggregate,   20    would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
To the extent applicable, each Sponsored Company Fund Client has elected to
be treated as, and has qualified as, a "regulated investment company" under
subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code. To the
extent applicable, each Sponsored Company Fund Client that is intended to be
a tax-exempt municipal bond fund has satisfied the requirements of
Section 852(b)(5) of the Code and is qualified to pay exempt interest
dividends as defined therein.   (c) Each Company Advisory Client (i) that

registration under the Investment Company Act, is entitled to rely upon
Section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of the Investment Company Act, as
applicable.   (d) Each of the Company Advisory Entities that is required to
be registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Advisers Act"), is duly
registered as such and each Company Advisory Entity that is required to make
a notice filing with certain states has filed such notice filings
except where failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each
Company Advisory Entity has filed all Forms ADV (if applicable) and all other
material reports and other filings, if any, required to be filed with the SEC
or any other Governmental Entity since January 1, 2002. The information
contained in such forms, reports and other filings was (or will be, in the
case of filings made after the date hereof) true and complete as of the time
of filing, except where the failure to be true and complete, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. The Company has made available to Parent a true and
complete copy of Part II of each such Company Advisory Entity\'s Form ADV
effective as of the date hereof.   (e) Each Sponsored Company Fund Client
and Company Advisory Entity (i) has since January 1, 1998 operated and is
currently operating in compliance with all Laws applicable to it or its
business and (ii) has all Permits required for the operation of its business
or ownership of its properties and assets as presently conducted except, in
the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, where the failure to be in compliance
or failure to have Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
business of each Sponsored Company Fund Client has been and is being
conducted in compliance with the terms of such Permits of the Sponsored
Company Fund Clients, except where the failure to be in compliance,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the knowledge of the Company, all
such Permits of the Sponsored Company Fund Clients are in full force and
effect. There is no proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened which would reasonably be expected to lead to the
revocation, amendment, failure to renew, limitation, suspension
or restriction of any such Permit, except for such revocations,
amendments, failures to renew, limitations, suspensions or restrictions
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has made available
true and complete copies of all exemptive orders, "no-action" letters or
similar exemptions or regulatory relief that were obtained by or on
behalf   21    of any Sponsored Company Fund Client and that, to the
knowledge of the Company, are required, as of the date hereof, for the
current operation of such Sponsored Company Fund Client in compliance with
Laws.   (f) Each Company Advisory Entity has been and is in compliance with
each Company Advisory Contract to which it is a party, except where the
failure to be so in compliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  
(g) The accounts of each Company Advisory Client subject to ERISA have been
managed by the applicable Subsidiary of the Company in compliance with the
applicable requirements of ERISA, except where the failure to be in
compliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (h) As of
the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of the Company Advisory Entities
nor any "affiliated person" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of any
of them is ineligible pursuant to Section 9(a) or (b) of the Investment
Company Act to serve as an investment adviser (or in any other capacity
contemplated by the Investment Company Act) to a registered investment
company; and none of the Company, any Company Advisory Entity or any "person
associated with an investment advisor" (as defined in the Investment Advisers
Act) of any of them is ineligible pursuant to Section 203 of the Investment
Advisers Act to serve as an investment adviser or as a person associated with
a registered investment adviser.   Section 3.13 Legal Proceedings. (a) There
is no claim, litigation, inquiry, suit, action, hearing, investigation or
proceeding (whether judicial, arbitral, regulatory, administrative or other)
("Action") pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against
or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any of its
properties, assets or rights, or challenging the validity or propriety of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or materially impair or materially
delay the ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder other
than any of the foregoing brought or threatened by an insured under a policy
issued by a Company Insurance Entity; nor is there any judgment, order,
decree, writ, directive, injunction, decision, ruling or award of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator, or any settlement or stipulation with any
Person, or any order or directive of any insurance regulatory
authority (including federal authorities with respect to variable insurance
and annuity products), or orders resulting from market conduct examinations
of insurance regulatory authorities (including federal authorities with
respect to variable insurance and annuity products) (collectively, "Order"),
outstanding or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company or materially impair or materially delay the ability of the
Company to perform its obligations hereunder.   (b) The Company has
provided Parent with all material written communications it has received
prior to the date hereof from each of the Illinois, California and Vermont
insurance departments relating to the ongoing market conduct investigation by
such departments involving John Hancock Life Insurance Company.  
22     Section 3.14 Taxes. (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have timely filed (or had filed on their behalf) all tax returns required to
be filed by any of them and have timely paid (or had paid on their behalf),
or have set up an adequate reserve for the payment of, all material taxes
required to be paid (whether or not shown to be due on such tax returns) with
respect to the periods covered by such returns, and the most recent financial
statements contained in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof reflect an adequate reserve for all taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries accrued, but not yet due and owing, through the date of
such financial statements, except where failure to so file, pay, or set up
an adequate reserve would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All such tax
returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects.   (b) No
material deficiencies for any taxes have been formally proposed, asserted or
assessed against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are not
adequately reserved for. The U.S. and Canadian federal income tax returns of

changes resulting from changes to the Code after the time of such issuance or
purchase or (ii) any life insurance contract issued by the Company or any of

commitment or understanding, whether written or oral ("Contract") (i) with
respect to financial advisors requiring payments of $5,000,000 or more, which

the term "Company Contract" shall not include the Company Rights Agreement.
All of the Company Contracts are valid and in full force and effect (except
those of which are cancelled, rescinded or terminated after the date hereof
in accordance with their terms), except where the failure to be in full force
and effect, individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the knowledge of the
Company, no Person is challenging the validity or enforceability of any
Company Contract, except such challenges which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, and to the
knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, none of the other parties
thereto, has violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any
act which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a
default under the provisions of,   25    any Company Contract, except
for those violations and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   Section 3.16 Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Section 3.16(a) of the

or not, under which any current or former employee, director or independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or
future right to benefits and under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any present or future liability. All such plans, agreements,
programs, policies and arrangements, whether or not listed in Section 3.16(a)

applicable Laws, rules and regulations (including, as applicable, any
Canadian Laws); (ii) each Company Plan which is intended to be qualified

Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under

no circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of
such qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code; (iii) no act or failure
to act by any of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any member of their
"Controlled Group" (defined as any organization which is a member of a

the Company or its Subsidiaries, either directly or by reason of their
affiliation with any member of their Controlled Group, being subject to any

Effect on the Company; (iv) no "reportable event" (as such term is defined in
ERISA Section 4043) or "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is

Material Adverse Effect on the Company; (v) no Company Plan subject to ERISA
provides retiree health and life benefits and neither the Company nor any of

benefits other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code; and (vi) none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with
respect to any Company Plan which is subject to ERISA that would reasonably
be expected to subject the Company or its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA that
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.   (c) As of the date of the most recent actuarial
valuation report for each Company Plan which is a "single employer plan"
(within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of
ERISA, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities",
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the
basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Company Plan\'s most
recent actuarial valuation, which the Company has made available to Parent),

and, as of the date hereof, there has been no material change in the
financial condition of such Company Plan since the last day of the most
recent plan year.   (d) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
member of their Controlled Group maintains or has an obligation to contribute

None of the execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or in connection with a
subsequent event) (x) result in the payment to any present or former employee
or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any money or other
property, (y) accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits to
any present or former employee or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (z) result in payment under any contract, plan or
arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any employee or former employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively,
would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the
Code.   27     (g) None of the Boards of Directors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, in anticipation of or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as may be
permitted under any Company Plan to provide or determine that a "Change in

defined in each applicable Company Plan) has occurred, or prior to the
Effective Time, will occur.   (h) Except as contemplated by Section 3.31 of

ownership, operation or leasing of its properties or assets makes such

Each of the Subsidiaries through which Parent conducts its material insurance
operations (collectively, the "Parent Insurance Entities") is listed in
Section 4.5 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. Each of the Parent Insurance
Entities has filed all annual and quarterly statements, together with all
exhibits, interrogatories, notes, schedules and any actuarial opinions,
affirmations or certifications or other supporting documents in connection
therewith, required to be filed with or submitted to the appropriate
insurance regulatory authorities of the jurisdiction in which it is domiciled
or commercially domiciled on forms prescribed or permitted by such authority
(collectively, the "Parent SAP Statements"), except for such failures to file
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has delivered or made
available to the Company copies of all of the Parent SAP Statements for each
Parent Insurance Entity for the periods beginning January 1, 2001 and through
the date hereof, each in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any
amendments thereto) filed with the applicable state insurance regulatory

insurance departments and any insurance regulatory authorities received by
Parent (to the extent permitted by applicable Laws in respect of the Parent
Insurance Entities incorporated in Canada) on or after January 1, 2001 and
through the date hereof relating to the Parent Insurance Entities. Financial
statements included in the Parent SAP Statements and prepared on a statutory
basis, including the notes thereto, were prepared in conformity with SAP
prescribed or permitted by the applicable insurance regulatory authority, in
each case, consistently applied for the periods covered thereby and present
fairly the statutory financial position of the relevant Parent Insurance
Entity as at the respective dates thereof and the results of operations of
such Parent Insurance Entity for the respective periods then ended. The
Parent SAP Statements complied in all material respects with all applicable
Laws, rules and regulations when filed, and no material deficiency has been
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to any Parent
SAP Statements. Except as indicated therein, all assets that are reflected
as admitted assets on the Parent SAP Statements comply with all Insurance
Laws with respect to admitted assets, as applicable, and are in an amount at
least equal to the minimum amounts required by Insurance Laws, except for
such failures to comply or failures to be at least equal to minimum amounts
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The statutory balance sheets and
income statements included in Parent SAP Statements have been audited by
Parent\'s independent auditors, and Parent has delivered or made available to
the Company true and complete copies of all audit opinions related thereto
for periods beginning January 1, 2000.   Section 4.6 Permits; Compliance
with Applicable Laws. (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have all Permits
required for the operation of their respective businesses or the operation,
ownership and leasing of their respective properties and assets, except for
such Permits the failure of which to have, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
or materially impair or materially delay the ability of Parent to perform its
obligations hereunder (the "Parent Permits"). The business of each of Parent
and its Subsidiaries has been and is being conducted in compliance with the
terms of all of the Parent Permits, except for such instances of
noncompliance which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or materially impair
or materially delay the ability of Parent to perform its obligations
hereunder. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or  
38    materially impair or materially delay the ability of Parent to
perform its obligations hereunder, all of the Parent Permits are in full
force and effect, and there is no proceeding or investigation pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened which would reasonably be expected to
lead to the revocation, amendment, failure to renew, limitation, suspension
or restriction of any such Permit.   (b) Except as disclosed in the Parent
Public Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since January 1,
2001, the businesses of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries, and the
ownership, leasing and operation of the properties and assets of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, have not been conducted in violation of any Laws, except
for any violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or
materially impair or materially delay the ability of Parent to perform its
obligations hereunder. No investigations or reviews by any Governmental
Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent or materially impair or materially delay the ability of
Parent to perform its obligations hereunder are pending or, to the knowledge
of Parent, threatened. Except as set forth in its statutory reports filed
prior to the date hereof, and except as required by Laws of general
applicability and the insurance permits, grants and licenses maintained by
Parent or its Subsidiaries, there are no written agreements, memoranda of
understanding, commitment letters or similar undertakings binding on Parent
or its Subsidiaries to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, on
the one hand, and any Governmental Entity is a party or addressee, on the
other hand, or orders or directives by, or supervisory letters from,
any Governmental Entity specifically with respect to Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, which (A) limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue life insurance policies or annuity contracts, (B)
require any investments of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to be treated as

or any of its Subsidiaries to pay dividends or other distributions or (E)
otherwise restrict the conduct of business of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in any material respect.   (c) Except where the failure to do
so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of Parent, its insurance agents,
solicitors, third party administrators, managers, brokers and distributors,
have marketed, sold and issued insurance, reinsurance and annuity products in
compliance with all applicable Laws governing sales processes and
practices.   (d) Section 4.6(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule

policies, binders, slips, certificates, guaranteed insurance contracts,

Entity (collectively, the "Parent Insurance Contracts"), and any and all
marketing materials are, to the extent required under applicable Insurance
Laws, on forms and at rates approved by the insurance regulatory authority of
the jurisdiction where issued or, to the extent required by applicable Laws,
have been filed with and not objected to by such authority within the period
provided for objection, except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.  
(b) Prior to the date hereof, Parent has delivered to the Company a true and
complete copy of any actuarial filings or reviews required or requested by
regulatory authorities and prepared by actuaries, independent or otherwise,
with respect to any Parent Insurance Entity since December 31, 2000 and prior

and modifications thereto (the "Parent Actuarial Analyses"). To the knowledge
of Parent, the information and data furnished by Parent or any Parent
Insurance Entity to its independent actuaries in connection with the
preparation of the Parent Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all material
respects.   Section 4.8 Reserves. The aggregate reserves of
Parent Insurance Entities as recorded in the Parent SAP Statements have been
determined in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted
actuarial principles consistently applied (except as set forth therein). All
reserves of Parent Insurance Entities set forth in the Parent SAP Statements
are fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles and meet the
requirements of all applicable Insurance Laws including the applicable SAP,
except where the failure to so state such reserves or meet such requirements,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   Section 4.9 Separate Accounts. (a)
Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, each separate account created
under the federal laws of the U.S. or the laws of a U.S. state and maintained
by a Parent Insurance Entity (a "Parent Separate Account") is duly and
validly established and maintained under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and is either excluded from the definition of an investment
company pursuant to Section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of the Investment
Company Act, or is duly registered as an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (i)
each such Parent Separate Account, if not registered, is operated and all of
its operations are conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws, and (ii)
each such Parent Separate Account, if registered, is operated in compliance
with the Investment Company Act, has filed all reports and amendments of its
registration statement required to be filed, and has been granted
all exemptive relief necessary for its operations as presently conducted.  
(b) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, the Parent Insurance
Contracts under   40    which the Parent Separate Account assets are
held are duly and validly issued and are either exempt from registration
under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 3(a)(2), 3(a)(8) or Section 4(2)
of the Securities Act or were sold pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, and each such registration statement is
currently in effect to the extent necessary to allow the appropriate Parent
Insurance Entity to receive contributions under such policies.   (c) The
assets of each Parent Separate Account that are subject to the provisions of
Section 817(h) of the Code are adequately diversified within the meaning of
Section 817(h) of the Code, except where the failure to be so treated would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (d) Each of the Parent Insurance
Entities incorporated or organized under the Laws of the U.S. or any state
thereof is treated for U.S. federal tax purposes as the owner of the assets
underlying the respective life insurance policies and annuity contracts
issued, entered into or sold by it, except where the failure to be so
treated, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   Section 4.10 Bank
Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns or "controls" (as defined in Section 2(a)(2) of the BHC
Act) a "bank" (as defined in Section 2(c) of the BHC Act) or a "bank holding
company" (as defined in Section 2(a)(i) of the BHC Act). As of the date

licenses held by such Subsidiaries with all applicable U.S. and Canadian
Governmental Entities and an indication as to whether such Subsidiary is a
member in good standing of the NASD or other U.S. or Canadian broker-dealer

hereof, no other Subsidiary of Parent is required by the nature of its
activities to be so registered under the Exchange Act or under the laws of
any state or other U.S. or Canadian jurisdiction or to be a member in good
standing of the NASD or other broker-dealer associations under any other
applicable Law. Parent has filed and made available to the Company, in the
form as filed, a true and complete copy of each such Subsidiary\'s Form
BD, if applicable, that is effective as of the date hereof. The
information contained in such forms and reports was (or will be, in the case
of filings made after the date hereof) true and complete as of the time of
filing, except where the failure to be true and complete, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.   (b) Each of the Parent Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries is
duly registered and licensed as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and
under any state, federal or foreign broker-dealer or similar laws pursuant to
which each such Parent Broker-Dealer Subsidiary is required to be so

Form BD which has been filed, to the extent applicable, by each Parent
Broker-Dealer   41    Subsidiary with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement, no Parent Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, nor any of its officers,
directors or employees, has been convicted of any crime or has been the
subject of any disciplinary proceedings or orders of any Governmental Entity,
and, to the knowledge of Parent, no such disciplinary proceeding or order is
pending or threatened; and no Parent Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, nor any
persons affiliated with such Parent Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any of such Parent Broker-Dealer Subsidiary\'s officers,
directors or employees of any of the foregoing or any "associated person" (as
defined in the Exchange Act) of such Parent Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, is or
has been subject to any disqualification that would be a basis for denial,
suspension or revocation of registration of a broker-dealer under Section 15,
15B or 15C of the Exchange Act.   (c) Each Parent Broker-Dealer Subsidiary
satisfies the minimum net capital requirements of the Exchange Act, if
applicable, or of the laws of any jurisdiction in which such Parent Broker-
Dealer Subsidiary conducts business, except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.   Section 4.12 Investment Adviser Subsidiaries; Funds;
Clients. (a) As of the date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries (the "Parent
Advisory Entities") provide investment management, investment advisory and
sub-advisory services (including management and advice provided to separate
accounts and participation in wrap fee programs). The Parent Advisory
Entities, as of the date hereof, providing investment advisory services in
the U.S. and Canada are listed on Section 4.12(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule. For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Advisory Contract" means
each Contract for such services provided by a Parent Advisory Entity; "Parent
Advisory Client" means each party to a Parent Advisory Contract other than
the applicable Parent Advisory Entity; "Parent Fund Client" means each Parent
Advisory Client that is registered as an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Each Sponsored Parent Fund Client (or the trust of
which it is a series) is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization,
except where the failure to be in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. The Boards of Trustees or directors of the Sponsored Parent Fund
Clients (or the trust of which it is a series) operate in conformity
with Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Investment Company Act, except as set forth
in Section 4.12(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.   (b) Each of the
Sponsored Parent Fund Clients is in compliance with all applicable Laws of
the SEC, the NASD, the IRS and any other Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction over such Sponsored Parent Fund Client or its distributor or
investment adviser and of any required state or other jurisdiction in which
such Sponsored Parent Fund Client is registered, qualified or sold and, to
the extent applicable, with its prospectus and any required statement of
additional information, except for such instances of noncompliance which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To the extent applicable, each Sponsored
Parent Fund Client has elected to be treated as, and has qualified as, a
"regulated investment company" under subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle
A of the Code. To the extent applicable, each Sponsored Parent Fund Client
that is intended to be a tax-exempt municipal bond fund has satisfied the
requirements of Section 852(b)(5) of the Code and is qualified to pay exempt
interest dividends as defined therein.   42      (c) Each Parent
Advisory Client (i) that was organized by a Parent Advisory Client or for
which a Parent Advisory Client or another Subsidiary of the Parent acts as
the general partner, managing member or in a similar capacity and (ii) that
relies upon Section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of the Investment Company
Act to be exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act, is
entitled to rely upon Section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of the Investment
Company Act, if applicable.   (d) Each of the Parent Advisory Entities that
is required to be registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act is duly registered as such and each Parent Advisory
Entity that is required to make a notice filing with certain states has filed
such notice filings except where failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. Each Parent Advisory Entity has filed all Forms ADV (if
applicable) and all other material reports and other filings, if any,
required to be filed with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity since
January 1, 2002. The information contained in such forms, reports and other
filings was (or will be, in the case of filings made after the date hereof)
true and complete as of the time of filings, except where the failure to be
true and complete, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has made
available to the Company, a true and complete copy of Part II of each such
Parent Advisory Entity\'s Form ADV effective as of the date hereof,
as applicable.   (e) Each Sponsored Parent Fund Client and Parent
Advisory Entity (i) has operated and is currently operating in compliance
with all Laws applicable to it or its business and (ii) has all Permits
required for the operation of its business or ownership of its properties and
assets as presently conducted except, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii)
above, where the failure to be in compliance or failure to have Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The business of each Sponsored
Parent Fund Client has been and is being conducted in compliance with the
terms of such Permits of the Sponsored Parent Fund Clients, except where the
failure to be in compliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To the
knowledge of Parent, all such Permits of the Sponsored Parent Fund Clients
are in full force and effect. There is no proceeding or investigation pending
or threatened which could lead to the revocation, amendment, failure to
renew, limitation, suspension or restriction of any such Permit, except for
such revocations, amendments, failures to renew, limitations, suspensions or
restrictions which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has made
available to the Company true and complete copies of all exemptive
orders, "no-action" letters or similar exemptions or regulatory relief that
were obtained by or on behalf of any Parent Fund Client and that, to the
knowledge of Parent, are required, as of the date hereof, for the current
operation of such Parent Fund Client in compliance with Laws.   (f) Each
Parent Advisory Entity has been and is in compliance with each Parent
Advisory Contract to which it is a party, except where the failure to be so
in compliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   43      (g) The
accounts of each Parent Advisory Client subject to ERISA to the extent, if
any, managed by a Subsidiary of Parent have been managed by the applicable
Subsidiary of Parent in compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA,
except where the failure to be in compliance, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.   (h) As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of
the Parent Advisory Entities nor any "affiliated person" (as defined in
the Investment Company Act) of any of them is ineligible pursuant to Section
9(a) or (b) of the Investment Company Act to serve as an investment adviser
(or in any other capacity contemplated by the Investment Company Act) to a
registered investment company; none of Parent, any Parent Advisory Entity or
any "person associated with an investment advisor" (as defined in the
Investment Advisers Act) is ineligible pursuant to Section 203 of the
Investment Advisers Act to serve as an investment adviser or as a person
associated with a registered investment adviser.   Section 4.13 Legal
Proceedings. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, against or affecting Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, or any
of its properties, assets or rights, or challenging the validity or propriety
of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or materially impair or materially delay
the ability of Parent to perform its obligations hereunder, other than any of
the foregoing brought or threatened by an insured under a policy issued by an
Insurance Subsidiary; nor is there any Order outstanding or, to the knowledge
of Parent, threatened against Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or materially impair or materially delay
the ability of Parent to perform its obligations hereunder.   Section 4.14
Taxes. (a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or had
filed on their behalf) all tax returns required to be filed by any of them
and have timely paid (or had paid on their behalf), or have set up an
adequate reserve for the payment of, all material taxes required to be paid
(whether or not shown to be due on such tax returns) with respect to
the periods covered by such returns, and the most recent financial
statements contained in the Parent Public Documents filed prior to the date
hereof reflect an adequate reserve for all taxes of Parent and its
Subsidiaries accrued, but not yet due and owing, through the date of such
financial statements except where failure to so file, pay, or set up an
adequate reserve would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. All such tax returns
are true, correct and complete in all material respects.   (b) No material
deficiencies for any taxes have been formally proposed, asserted or assessed
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved
for. The U.S. and Canadian federal income tax returns of Parent and each of
its Subsidiaries have been examined by and settled with the IRS for all years
through 1997 and with the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency for all years
through 1995, respectively, or the period for assessment of the taxes in
respect of which such tax returns were filed has expired.   (c) Proper and
accurate amounts have been withheld, collected or deposited by Parent and its
Subsidiaries from their employees, agents, independent contractors,
creditors,   44     shareholders and policyholders in compliance with
the tax withholding provisions of applicable federal, state, provincial and
local Laws and have been paid over to the appropriate taxing authorities
except for such amounts that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (d)
There are no material tax Liens upon any property or assets of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries except Liens for taxes not yet due and payable.   (e)
Except as set forth in Section 4.14(e)(i) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income tax return (other than
a group the common parent of which was Parent) or (ii) has any material
liability for the taxes of any Person (other than any of Parent or its
Subsidiaries) including, but not limited to, under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of Canadian federal or
provincial or state, local or other foreign Laws) or as a transferee or
successor.   (f) None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has taken (or
failed to take) any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or
other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.   (g) None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, is
bound by or has any obligation under, any tax sharing agreement or similar
contract or arrangement or any agreement that obligates it to make
any payment computed by reference to the taxes, taxable income or taxable
losses of any other Person except for any such agreements, contracts or
arrangements that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (h) No closing
agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar provision of
Canadian federal or provincial or state, local or other foreign Laws) has
been entered into by or with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
which will result in material future tax payments.   (i) Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has obtained or requested a ruling from any taxing
authority that has had, or if issued would have, a material effect on Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable year for which the applicable
statute of limitations has not expired.   (j) Parent is not aware of any
material liability that may result from: (i) the tax treatment under the Code
of insurance contracts, annuity contracts, financial products, employee
benefit plans (other than any Parent Plan), individual retirement accounts or
annuities and any similar or related policy, contract, plan or product,
whether individual, group or otherwise, if any, issued or sold by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries being less favorable to the purchaser, policyholder
or intended beneficiaries thereof than the tax treatment under the Code for
which such policies, products, plans or contracts qualified or purported to
qualify at the time of their issuance or purchase, except for changes
resulting from changes to the Code after the time of such issuance or
purchase or (ii) any life insurance contract issued by Parent or any of
its   45     Subsidiaries (whether developed or administered or
reinsured with any other Person) that is a MEC failing to be marketed as
such.   (k) To the knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof, there are no
currently pending or threatened federal, state, provincial, local or foreign
audits with regard to the tax treatment of any policy, contract, product or
plan sold, issued or administered by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(whether developed by or reinsured with any other Person) except for such
audits that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (l) There is no
material contingent liability resulting from Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries being a party to any hold harmless, sharing, allocation or
indemnification agreement with respect to the tax qualification or treatment
of any policy, contract, product or plan sold, issued or administered by any
insurance company (whether developed by or reinsured with any other
Person).   Section 4.15 Certain Agreements. Except as disclosed in
the Parent Public Documents filed prior to the date hereof and except for
this Agreement, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any Contract (i) with respect to
financial advisors requiring payments of $5,000,000 or more, which is not
terminable within one year without penalty, (ii) which is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under
the Exchange Act), (iii) which requires any payment by Parent or its
Subsidiaries in excess of $20,000,000 in any year and which is not terminable
within one year without penalty, or which requires any payment to Parent or
its Subsidiaries in excess of $50,000,000 in any year and which is not
terminable within one year without penalty, in each of the cases in this
clause (iii), excluding any payments required to be made by or to Parent or
its Subsidiaries pursuant to insurance or annuity policies or products or in
the ordinary course investment activities of Parent or its Subsidiaries, (iv)
which limits (or purports to limit) in any way the ability of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to compete or engage in any line of
business, in any geographic area or with any Person, (v) which constitutes
material reinsurance arrangements under which Parent Insurance Entities cede
over $25,000,000 of premiums annually, other than agreements between Parent
Insurance Entities, (vi) relating to, or evidencing, indebtedness for
borrowed money or any guarantee of indebtedness for borrowed money, in
each case, involving an amount in excess of $100,000,000 (excluding any
indebtedness relating to guaranteed investment contracts or funding
agreements issued in the ordinary course of business by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries), (vii) since January 1, 2000, relating to the acquisition or
disposition of any business (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of
assets, indemnity insurance or otherwise) which involves an asset value in
excess of $500,000,000 or a purchase price in excess of $100,000,000 except
for such acquisitions or dispositions made in the ordinary course investment
activities of Parent or its Subsidiaries and except for any products sold by
Parent or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, or (viii)
relating to, or evidencing, any guarantee of obligations of any non-wholly-
owned Subsidiary or affiliate. Parent has previously made available to the
Company complete and accurate copies of each Contract of the type described
in this Section 4.15 which was entered into prior to the date hereof. All
Contracts of the type described in this Section 4.15 shall be referred to as
"Parent Contracts" regardless of whether they were entered into before or
after the date hereof. All of the Parent Contracts are valid and in full
force and effect (except those of   46     which are cancelled,
rescinded or terminated after the date hereof in accordance with their
terms), except where the failure to be in full force and effect, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. To the knowledge of Parent, no Person
is challenging the validity or enforceability of any Parent Contract, except
such challenges which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries, and to the knowledge of Parent, as of the date
hereof, none of the other parties thereto, has violated any provision of, or
committed or failed to perform any act which (with or without notice, lapse
of time or both) would constitute a default under the provisions of, any
Parent Contract, except for those violations and defaults which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.   Section 4.16 Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Section
4.16(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list,
as of the date hereof, of each material, written employee benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement (including all "employee benefit plans"

multiemployer plans within the meaning of ERISA section 3(37)), stock
purchase, stock option, stock or stock-based award, severance, employment,
compensation, change-in-control, hospitalization or medical benefit, life or
other insurance, dental, disability, salary continuation, vacation,
supplemental unemployment benefit, profit sharing, bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, mortgage assistance, savings, pension, supplemental pension,
retiree welfare, retention and all other employee benefit plans, agreements,
programs, policies or other arrangements, whether or not subject to
applicable legislation including ERISA (including any funding mechanism
therefor now in effect or required in the future as a result of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise), whether or not
insured or funded, whether formal or informal, legally binding or not, under
which any current or former employee, director or independent contractor of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future right to benefits
and under which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future
liability. All such plans, agreements, programs, policies and arrangements
shall be collectively referred to as the "Parent Plans". Section 4.16(a) of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule also identifies each of the Parent plans that
is a "registered pension plan" within the meaning of the Income Tax Act
(Canada) (collectively, the "Canadian Pension Plans"). With respect to each
Parent Plan, Parent has made available to the Company a current, accurate and
complete copy thereof as in effect through the date hereof and, to the extent
applicable: (i) any related trust agreement or other funding instrument; (ii)
the most recent letter of confirmation of each Canadian Pension Plan pursuant
to applicable provincial pension legislation and the Income Tax Act (Canada),

each Canadian Pension Plan with any applicable governmental agency; (B) Form
5500 and attached schedules, (C) audited financial statements and (D)

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, each Parent Plan has been established and
administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada), ERISA, the Code and
other applicable   47     Canadian and U.S. federal Laws, rules and
regulations; (ii) each Parent Plan which is a Canadian Pension Plan is duly
registered and in good standing under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and
applicable provincial pension benefit Laws and nothing has occurred, whether
by action or failure to act, that could reasonably be expected to cause the
loss of such registration; (iii) each Parent Plan which is intended to be
qualified within the meaning of Code Section 401(a) has received a favorable
Determination Letter from the IRS as to qualification, which covers all tax
Law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within
the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code,
and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such qualification under
Section 401(a) of the Code; (iv) no act or failure to act by any of Parent,
its Subsidiaries, or any member of their Controlled Group has occurred that
would reasonably be expected to result in Parent or its Subsidiaries, either
directly or by reason of their affiliation with any member of their
Controlled Group, being subject to any tax, fine, lien, penalty or other
liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws
which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent; (v) if applicable, no
"reportable event" (as such term is defined in ERISA Section 4043) or
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in ERISA Section
302 and Code Section 412 (whether or not waived)) has occurred with respect
to any Parent Plan which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent; (vi) except as set
forth in Section 4.16(b)(vi) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no Parent
Plan subject to ERISA provides retiree health and life benefits and neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have any obligation to provide any such
benefits other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code or other
applicable Canadian Laws; and (vii) neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Parent Plan
which is subject to ERISA that would reasonably be expected to subject Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA that would, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (c) Except as set
forth in Section 4.16(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of
the most recent actuarial valuation report for each Parent Plan which is a
"single-employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a) of ERISA)
subject to Title IV of ERISA, the actuarially determined present value of all
"benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Parent
Plan\'s most recent actuarial valuation report, which Parent has made
available to the Company), did not exceed the then current value of the
assets of such Parent Plan, and, as of the date hereof, there has been no
material change in the financial condition of such Parent Plan since the last
day of the most recent plan year.   (d) None of Parent, its Subsidiaries or
any member of their Controlled Group maintains or has an obligation to

ERISA).   (e) With respect to any Parent Plan, (i) no actions, suits or
claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened which, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent, (ii) to the knowledge of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
no   48     facts or circumstances exist that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such actions, suits or claims which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and (iii) no material, written
communication has been received from the PBGC in connection with the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement in respect of any Parent Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA concerning the funded status of any such plan or
any transfer of assets and liabilities from any such plan.   (f) No Parent
Plan and none of the execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in connection with a
subsequent event) will (x) result in the payment to any present or former
employee or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any money or
other property, (y) accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits to any
present or former employee or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or (z) result in payment under any contract, plan or arrangement (written or
otherwise) covering any employee or former employee of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, could give rise to
the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms
of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations thereunder or any similar provision of Canadian federal or
provincial or state, local or other foreign tax Laws.   Section 4.17 Labour

process) reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the Merger, and each party shall furnish
all necessary information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock
as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each party
will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Form F-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form F-4. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting any information relating to any of the parties, or their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by any
party which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by Law, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.   (b) The
Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following
the date upon which the Form F-4 becomes effective (the "Company Stockholders
Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required Company Vote with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, subject to Section
6.4(b), (i) shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this
Agreement by the Required Company Vote, (ii) shall recommend adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company to the effect as set forth in
Section 3.28 (the "Company Recommendation"); and (iii) shall not withdraw,
modify or qualify (or publicly propose to or publicly state that it intends
to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent
such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in Company  
61     Recommendation") (it being understood that any confidential
communication in connection with informing Parent that it is considering a
Change in Company Recommendation shall not constitute a Change in Company
Recommendation), provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing the
Company may effect a Change in Company Recommendation if the Company\'s Board
of Directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel, has determined
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and, in the case such Change in Company
Recommendation is in respect of an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall
have complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
Section 6.4 with respect thereto. Notwithstanding any Change in Company
Recommendation, if this Agreement is not otherwise terminated by either the
Company or Parent in accordance with the terms hereof this Agreement shall be
submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting for the purpose of voting on adopting this Agreement (but the Company
may solicit votes consistent with its Change in Company Recommendation), and
nothing contained herein (other than the termination rights set forth in
Article VIII), including any rights of the Company to take certain actions
pursuant to Section 6.4, shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such
obligation.   (c) In the case the Board of Directors of the Company
is considering effecting a Change in Company Recommendation that is not in
respect of an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall provide Parent
notice at least five days in advance of making such Change in Company
Recommendation (unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be
given there are less than five days prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, in which case the Company shall provide as much notice as is
reasonably practicable), that it is considering making such change and of the
reason therefor.   (d) Information Supplied. Each of the Company and
Parent agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the
information supplied by it or its Subsidiaries or to be supplied for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form F-4 will, at the time
the Form F-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to the
stockholders and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, insofar
as it relates to the Company Stockholders Meeting, will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder. No representation or warranty is or
will be made by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
Form F-4 and no representation or warranty is or will be made by Parent with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form F-4.   Section 6.2 Access to
Information; Confidentiality. (a) Subject to applicable Laws, including Laws
relating to the exchange of information and all applicable antitrust,  
62     competition and similar Laws, and attorney-client and other
privileges, and upon reasonable notice, the Company and Parent shall each
(and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the
representatives of the other, reasonable access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts and records and, during such period, each of the Company and Parent
shall (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) make
available to the other as part of such access (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of applicable securities Laws
of the U.S. or any state thereof or Canada or any province thereof, (ii) all
Company or Parent SAP Statements, as the case may be, and (iii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
party may reasonably request.   (b) The parties will hold any such
information which is nonpublic in confidence to the extent required by, and
in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement dated
August 1, 2003 between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Confidentiality
Agreement to the contrary, any party to this Agreement (and any employee,
representative, or other agent of any party to this Agreement) may disclose
to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal
income tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure; provided, however, that the preceding portion of this sentence
shall not permit any party (or any employee, representative or other agent
thereof) to disclose (i) any information prior to the earlier of (x) the date
of public announcement of discussions relating to any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or by the Confidentiality
Agreement, (y) the date of public announcement of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or by the Confidentiality Agreement or (z) the
date of the execution of an agreement (with or without conditions) to enter
into any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or by the Confidentiality
Agreement or (ii) any information that is not relevant to an understanding of
the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the identity of any party to this Agreement (or its
employees, representatives or agents) or other information that could lead
any person to determine such identity.   (c) No such investigation by either
Parent or the Company of the other shall affect the representations and
warranties of the other.   Section 6.3 Reasonable Best Efforts. Each of the
Company, Merger Co. and Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements which
may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain (and to cooperate with the other parties to obtain) as promptly as
reasonably practicable any permit, consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other public or
private third party which is required to be obtained or made by such party or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to   63     applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly cooperate with and furnish information to the other and, to the
extent practicable, consult with each other on, all the information relating
to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective
affiliates, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Entity or any other third party in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of
all permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, and orders of
all Governmental Entities and any other third parties necessary or advisable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of
the Company and Parent shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of written notices or
other communications received by Parent or the Company or any of their
respective affiliates from any such third party or Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and Parent shall
provide the other party with the opportunity to participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or
other inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that (i) such participation of the Company to be permitted by Parent
shall not be required in connection with meetings not primarily related to
obtaining such Requisite Regulatory Approvals; and (ii) such participation
shall not entitle the Company to direct the conduct of any such meeting or
otherwise bind Parent to any action.   (b) Each of the Company and Parent
and their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or
similar statute of any U.S. state or Canadian province becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby,
take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.   (c) As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in preparing and shall cause to be filed, and shall cause their Subsidiaries
to file with all applicable Governmental Entities, all filings required to be
made under Laws governing the insurance businesses of Parent and the Company
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Insurance
Filings"). Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, provide each other with copies of any written comments and
advise the other party of any oral comments with respect to the Insurance
Filings from each applicable Governmental Entity. Each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any Insurance Filing, and on any amendment or
supplement thereto and each will provide the other with a copy of all such
filings made.   (d) If any objections are asserted with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental Entity or any other
third party under any applicable Law, or if any suit is instituted by any
Governmental Entity or any other third party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable Law, each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any
such objections or challenges as   64     such Governmental Entity or
other third party may have to such transactions as promptly as practicable so
as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereby agree
and acknowledge that reasonable best efforts under Section 6.3(a) shall not
require, or be construed to require, Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or other affiliates, to (i)(A) offer, sell or
hold separate pending divesture, or agree to offer, sell or hold separate
pending divestiture, or (B) consent to any such offer, sale, holding or
agreement, before or after the Effective Time, of any businesses, operations
or assets, or interests in any businesses, operations or assets, of Parent,
the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or other affiliates), or (ii) take or agree to take any other
action or agree or consent to any limitation or restrictions on or changes in
any such businesses, operations or assets of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other
affiliates) that, in the case of all such requirements described in clause
(i) and (ii), are, individually or in the aggregate with all other such
requirements, materially adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole or Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (either before or
after giving effect to the Merger) (a "Burdensome Condition").   Section
6.4 Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective directors, officers or financial or
legal advisors shall, and that it shall direct and use its best efforts to
cause the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' other employees, advisors,
agents, representatives and other intermediaries not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or encourage any inquiries or the making
of any proposal or offer from or by any Person (other than Parent) with
respect to, or a transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries or any purchase or sale of 10% or more of the assets
(including, without limitation, stock of its Subsidiaries) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender
or exchange offer for, voting securities of the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would result in any Person (or
the stockholders of such Person) beneficially owning securities representing
10% or more of the total voting power of the Company (or of the surviving
parent entity in such transaction) or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
(any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made
by Parent or an affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal"); (ii) enter into any agreement binding on the Company
or its Subsidiaries that would approve or endorse, or propose publicly to
approve or endorse, any Acquisition Proposal or in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal, require the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated under
this Agreement; or (iii) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic
information with respect to its business, properties or assets in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes of this Section 6.4, the term "Person" shall also
include any "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, but
shall exclude Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.   (b) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors, officers, advisors and
other representatives shall be permitted to (i) comply with Rule 14a-9,  
65     14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal or make any disclosures that are required by
applicable Law (it being understood that if any such statements or
disclosures pursuant to this clause (i) constitute a Change in Company
Recommendation, the Company shall comply with all applicable provisions of
this Section 6.4 with respect thereto), (ii) effect a Change in Company
Recommendation, (iii) provide nonpublic information or data to, any Person in
response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such
Person made after the date of this Agreement and enter into discussions
related thereto, (iv) enter into or participate in discussions
or negotiations with any Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement or (v) if the
Required Company Vote has not been obtained, recommend to the Company\'s
stockholders or otherwise publicly recommend or enter into an agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, if:   (A) in the case of clause (ii), (iii)
or (iv)  above, (1) the Required Company Vote has not been obtained;  and
(2) the Company\'s Board of Directors, after consultation  with outside legal
counsel, has determined in good faith that  failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its  fiduciary duties under applicable Law;   (B) in
the case of clause (ii) or (v) above, if  the Board of Directors of the
Company is considering effecting  a Change in Company Recommendation in
respect of an  Acquisition Proposal, or taking any action referred to in 
clause (v), then, prior to effecting such Change in Company  Recommendation
or taking such other action, (1) the Company  shall have complied in all
material respects with the  provisions of this Section 6.4, (2) the Board of
Directors of  the Company shall have concluded in good faith by a majority 
vote that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior  Proposal after
giving effect to all of the adjustments which  may be offered by Parent
pursuant to clause (4) below; (3) it  shall have notified Parent, at least
five business days in  advance of effecting such Change in Company
Recommendation or  taking such action, or both, that it is considering
effecting  a Change in Company Recommendation or taking such other  action,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such  Superior Proposal and
the identity of the Person making such  Superior Proposal and the other
documents and information  specified in Section 6.4(c); and (4) during such
five Business  Day Period it shall have negotiated, and shall have made its 
financial and legal advisors reasonably available to  negotiate, with Parent
should Parent elect to make such  adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such  that, after giving effect thereto, such Acquisition
Proposal  no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal;   (C) in the case of
clause (iii) or (iv) above,  the Company\'s Board of Directors has concluded
in good faith  by a majority vote that such Acquisition Proposal, if 
consummated, would constitute or, based on information  available to the
Board of Directors, is reasonably likely to  lead to a Superior Proposal, and
prior to providing any  nonpublic information or data to any Person in
connection with  such Acquisition Proposal, its Board of Directors receives 
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement (a copy  of which
shall be provided to   66      Parent for informational purposes
promptly after execution  thereof) having provisions that are no less
favorable to the  Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement  (or to the extent any provisions are less favorable to the 
Company, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed  thereupon waived to
give Parent the benefit of all such  different provisions); and   (c) The
Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) after
receipt or occurrence of (1) any bona fide Acquisition Proposal, (2) any
request for information with respect to any bona fide Acquisition Proposal,
and (3) the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal,
or request for information, and the identity of the Person making any such
Acquisition Proposal or request for information. In addition, the Company
shall promptly keep Parent informed of the status and material terms and
conditions (including any amendments or proposed changes) of any
such Acquisition Proposal or request for information and as to the status
and material developments with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal or
request for information and shall provide to Parent within one business day
after receipt thereof all copies of any documentation setting forth or
describing the material terms and conditions relating to such Acquisition
Proposal received by the Company from the Person (or from any representatives
or agents of such Person) making such Acquisition Proposal or request for
information. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company\'s business, present or future
performance, financial condition or results of operations provided to any
other Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal that was not
previously provided to Parent. All information provided to Parent under this
Section 6.4(c) shall be kept confidential by Parent and its representatives
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.   (d) The
Company agrees that it shall immediately cease and cause its Subsidiaries,
and its and their respective officers, directors, and financial and legal
advisors, and shall direct and use its best efforts to cause its other
employees, agents, representatives, advisors and other intermediaries, to
cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
and shall obtain the return or require the destruction of any information
previously provided with respect to such activities, discussions, or
negotiations to the extent it may require such return or destruction.   (e)
For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal and such
other matters as the Board of Directors deems relevant, (i) is more favorable
to the stockholders of the Company, from a financial point of view, than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the terms, if any,
proposed by Parent to amend or modify the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably
capable of being fully financed and otherwise reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed; provided that, for purposes of
this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.4(a), except that the
reference to "10% or more" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall
be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall
only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving voting securities of the
Company.   67      (f) It is understood that participation by the
Company or its officers, advisors or other representatives in discussions or
negotiations in compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.4 shall not
be deemed "solicitations" for purposes of this Section and an Acquisition
Proposal if initially unsolicited in compliance with this Section 6.4 shall
continue to be deemed an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal notwithstanding
changes in such Acquisition Proposal as a result of such discussions or
negotiations.   Section 6.5 Affiliates. At least ten days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all
persons who are reasonably likely to be or were, as the case may be, at the
time this Agreement is or was submitted for approval to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145
under the Securities Act. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause each Person named on the letter delivered by it to deliver to Parent
prior to the Closing a written agreement, substantially in the form attached
as Exhibit B.   Section 6.6 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its
best efforts to cause the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger and
all other Parent Common Shares that may be issued in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby to be approved for listing on the NYSE
and TSX, subject to customary conditions and official notice of issuance as
soon as practicable after the date hereof.   Section 6.7 ERISA Fiduciary.
To the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to, as of the
Effective Time, cease to manage, or otherwise to be deemed a "fiduciary"
(within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA) with respect to, any and all
assets of any Person to which the Company or any Subsidiary provides
investment advisory, administration, brokerage, trust, other fiduciary or
distribution services on the date hereof that are (i) subject to ERISA and
(ii) invested, as of the date hereof, in equity and/or debt securities of
Parent or any member of a Controlled Group or which is under common control
with Parent within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code.   Section 6.8
Fees and Expenses. (a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except
(i) as otherwise provided in Section 6.8(b) and Section 8.2 hereof and (ii)
the Company and Parent shall share equally all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with (A) the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy/Prospectus
and the Form F-4, and (B) the filing fees incurred pursuant to the
requirements of the HSR Act and the Competition Act.   (b) All stock
transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other
similar taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any such taxes)
("Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by
the Company, and the Company shall cooperate with Merger Co. and Parent in
preparing, executing and filing any tax returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes.   Section 6.9 Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance.
(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to,   68     indemnify and hold harmless the
present and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(the "Indemnified Parties") for any costs and expenses, judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative by reason of the fact that such Person was an officer, director
or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
those related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby),
and shall advance expenses in respect thereof, in each case to the fullest
extent permitted by Law.   (b) For a period of six years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the
Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred on
or before the Effective Time (including those related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby); provided, however, that Parent shall
not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the
extent such premiums exceed 360% of the premiums paid as of the date hereof
by the Company for such insurance, as set forth in Section 6.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the "Company\'s Current Premium"), and if such premiums
for such insurance would at any time exceed 360% of the Company\'s Current
Premium, then Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which, in Parent\'s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to 360% of the Company\'s Current
Premium. The provisions of this Section 6.9(b) shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Closing for
purposes of this Section 6.9, which policies provide such directors and
officers with coverage no less advantageous to the insured for an aggregate
period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time (including those related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), and for a premium not in
excess of the aggregate of the premiums set forth in the preceding sentence
and, subject to the following sentence, if such prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Closing by either the Company or Parent, Parent
shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor
the obligations thereunder.   (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is made
against any Indemnified Party, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.9 shall continue in effect
until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.   (d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to maintain for a period of six years following the Effective Time
the indemnification, expense reimbursement and related provisions contained
in Article VI of the Company\'s by-laws as in effect on the date hereof.  
(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary to effect such assumption, proper provisions shall be made
so that such successors and assigns shall assume all of the applicable
obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.   69      (f) The
provisions of this Section 6.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise.   Section 6.10 Public Announcements. Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint
communications plan and (b) subject to any of its rights hereunder to ensure
that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan. The initial press release with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release and
thereafter Parent and the Company shall each use reasonable best efforts to
consult with each other before issuing or permitting any of their
Subsidiaries to issue any press release or, to the extent
practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
applicable listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange.
Without limiting the foregoing (except in the event of a Change in Company
Recommendation, in which case the foregoing provisions of this Section shall
not apply), the Company shall provide Parent with stockholder lists of the
Company and allow and facilitate Parent contact with stockholders of the
Company and other prospective investors.   Section 6.11 Qualification of
Company Fund Clients. Subject to applicable fiduciary duties to the Sponsored
Company Fund Clients, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the Sponsored Company Fund Clients refrain from taking
any action that (a) would prevent any Sponsored Company Fund Client from
qualifying as a "regulated investment company" within the meaning of Section
851 of the Code or (b) would be inconsistent with any Sponsored Company Fund
Client\'s then current prospectus and other offering advertising and
marketing materials (including any supplements or amendments thereto that may
be required to reflect any changes in operations).   Section 6.12 Post-
Closing Operations. (a) Parent intends that following the Effective Time the
headquarters of the combined North American business conducted by Parent and
its affiliates and the Company and its affiliates and significant operations
related thereto (other than its investment businesses) shall be located in
the Company\'s existing owned or leased facilities in Boston, Massachusetts
and Charlestown, Massachusetts. The Company\'s and Parent\'s plans also
include a continued meaningful presence in the Boston, Massachusetts area
and, in accordance therewith, Parent shall cause the home office and primary
executive offices of John Hancock Life Insurance Company to be located in
Boston until at least February 28, 2008. Parent\'s head office, together with
that of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company will remain in Canada, and
Parent will, through such head office, be responsible for the overall
management and direction of the operations of the combined businesses
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, which will include, after the Effective Time,
the continuing operation of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries.   (b) For the period until February 28, 2008, Parent
shall endeavor to maintain the Company\'s level of total charitable giving
in Massachusetts at the level of direct grants over the years 2001, 2002 and
2003 and maintain its leadership position in supporting the Boston,
Massachusetts school system and sponsoring community activities.  
70      (c) For the period until February 28, 2008, Parent will commit
to ensure that a majority of employees of the John Hancock Life

(a) the Integration Chair, (b) three senior executives of Parent, designated
by the Chief Executive Officer of Parent, and (c) two other senior executives
of the Company, designated by David F. D\'Alessandro. Subject to applicable
Law, the Integration team will be concerned with matters relating to the
integration of Parent\'s and the Company\'s respective businesses and
personnel following the Effective Time ("Integration") and will periodically
both prior to and following the Effective Time meet to discuss and review
these matters until it is determined by the Chief Executive Officer of Parent
that the Integration is complete and the Integration Team is dissolved. In
making personnel decisions, the Integration Team shall evaluate the
qualifications of each employee evaluated and the needs of the business after
the Effective Time (without regard to the relative severance costs associated
with a particular employee or group of employees).   Section 6.14 Parent
Officers and Directors   (a) Subject to applicable Laws, Parent shall take
such actions such that, immediately following the Effective Time, (i) the
directors of Parent shall be the directors of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time and David F. D\'Alessandro and (ii) David F. D\'Alessandro
shall be named as Chief Operating Officer and President-Designate as of such
time and, effective as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
President of Parent.   (b) Parent shall cause a Person selected by the Board
of Directors of the Company and currently serving as an independent director
of the Company (a "Company Director") to be nominated immediately prior to
the Effective Time for election to the Board of Directors of Parent at the
first annual meeting of Parent\'s shareholders following the Effective Time;
provided that if the Effective Time occurs after the annual meeting to be
held in 2004, such Person will be appointed to the Parent Board of Directors
at the Effective Time; and provided, further, that if Parent is unable to
make such nomination in its proxy statement for Parent\'s 2004 annual
meeting, such Person shall be appointed immediately following the Effective
Time if such meeting occurs prior thereto or otherwise immediately following
such meeting. Three additional Company Directors shall be appointed to the
Board of Directors of Parent no later than the first anniversary of the
Effective Time.   (c) So long as David F. D\'Alessandro is employed
by Parent, he shall be a member of the Executive Committee of Parent. In
addition, the persons named on Section 6.14 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
will also be appointed as members of such Executive Committee immediately
following the Effective Time. David F. D\'Alessandro shall, immediately
following the Effective Time, be appointed, subject to his consent, as a
member of each committee of Parent\'s Board of Directors that permits
membership by members of Parent\'s   71     management (for greater
clarity, a committee of Parent\'s Board of Directors shall be deemed not to
permit members of Parent\'s management if no members of the then-existing
Parent management serve on such committee at such time) and shall, subject to
applicable Law consistent with the best practices of Parent\'s Board of
Directors relating to committee appointments, and so long as he serves as a
director of Parent, remain (subject to the foregoing limitations) on at least
one committee of Parent\'s Board of Directors. In addition, each
Company Director, at the time he or she becomes a director, shall be
appointed to at least one committee of the Board of Directors of Parent
(assuming such Company Director meets any applicable independence
requirement) and shall, subject to the applicable Laws and the best practices
of Parent\'s Board of Directors relating to Committee appointments, maintain
such positions while they remain members of Parent\'s Board of Directors.  
Section 6.15 Bank Regulatory Matters. It is understood and agreed by the
parties that, unless otherwise determined by Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time) shall become registered as a bank holding
company pursuant to the BHC Act or as a savings and loan holding
company pursuant to the U.S. Home Owners\' Loan Act, as amended) in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Unless the parties
shall agree in writing on an alternative structure, the Company shall, with
the cooperation of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to,
notwithstanding any terms of this Agreement to the contrary, either divest
all of the capital stock of the Company Bank or cause the Company Bank to no
longer be considered a bank for purposes of the BHC Act and shall not take
any action that would result in the Company Bank, if acquired at the
Effective Time by Parent pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby,
being considered a savings association for purposes of the U.S. Home Owners\'
Loan Act.   Section 6.16 Employee Benefits. (a) Parent shall provide,
or cause the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of either of them,
as applicable, to provide, for those employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who continue, on and after the Effective Time, as employees of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any Subsidiary of any of
them, as applicable, from the Effective Time through December 31, 2005 (the
"Benefits Continuation Period"), compensation and employee benefits (other
than any retention or other extraordinary incentive compensation awards
payable in cash and any equity-based compensation or equity-based benefits)
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than such compensation and
benefits provided by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company
to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that,
with respect to employees who are subject to collective bargaining or
employment agreements (including "change in control" or "employment
continuation" agreements) to the extent provided for under such agreements,
the compensation, benefits and any other payments to be provided thereunder
shall be provided in accordance with the terms of such agreements (although
no such agreement (or any compensation or benefit commitments thereunder)
shall be taken into account for purposes of determining the compensation and
benefit obligations of Parent through the Benefits Continuation Period as set
forth above). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
obligate the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
of any of them to (x) maintain any particular Company Plan or (y) grant or
issue any equity or equity-based awards relating to Parent Common Shares.  
72      (b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
(i) waive any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods
and actively-at-work requirements with respect to participation and coverage
requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of the
Parent or Subsidiary of Parent, Surviving Corporation or Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation that an employee or former employee of the Company
or any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries would otherwise be eligible to
participate in following the Effective Time, to the extent such exclusions,
requirements or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied
by, such employee or former employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the relevant Company employee benefit plan in which such employee or
former employee participated, (ii) provide, or cause to be provided to, each
such employee, former employee and their beneficiaries with credit for any
co-payments, out-of-pocket expenses and deductibles paid (to the same extent
such credit was given under the analogous Company employee benefit plan prior
to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or
out-of-pocket requirements in respect of the plan year in which the Closing
occurs and (iii) recognize, or cause to be recognized, service prior to the
Effective Time with the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting credit and amount of benefits under
any other benefit plan to the same extent such service was recognized by the
Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries under any similar Company employee
benefit plan in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it
would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.   (c) In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation and
the Subsidiaries of Parent to, honor, fulfill and discharge in
accordance with their terms all Company Plans set forth in Section 3.16(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule and, to the extent required under any such
agreement, plan, program, policy or arrangement, at the Effective Time,
Parent hereby expressly agrees to assume each such agreement, plan, program,
policy or arrangement and to perform the obligations under each such
agreement, plan, program, policy or arrangement in accordance with its terms
in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company (or any Subsidiary
thereof, as applicable) would be required to perform (subject to giving
effect to the Merger) if the Merger had not occurred; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall limit the ability of Parent to amend or terminate any of
the Company Plans, to the extent permitted thereunder, in accordance with
their terms. Notwithstanding anything set forth above, Parent or a Subsidiary
of Parent, Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation
(i) shall not adopt any amendment to any employee benefit plan listed in
Section 6.16(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Scheduled
Plan"), or take any action, the intention or immediate and direct effect of
which would be to deprive any employee, who immediately prior to
the Effective Time is eligible to participate (with such participation
contingent upon the occurrence of the Merger) or who then participates in a
Scheduled Plan, of coverage or benefits under any such applicable Scheduled
Plan during the period specified for each Scheduled Plan (as identified in
Section 6.16(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to such
Scheduled Plan) and (ii) shall, for the avoidance of doubt, cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide severance benefits to any such Company
employees who become entitled to receive severance benefits under any
Scheduled Plan that provides for severance benefits for a period specified in
such Scheduled Plan (which period Parent acknowledges may extend beyond the
Benefits   73     Continuation Period) (and any other Company Plans
pursuant to which any such Company employee becomes entitled to receive any
other severance benefits).   Section 6.17 Parent Vote. Parent shall vote or
cause to be voted any shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than shares held for the benefit of Persons
