ARTICLE II

 


  _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the 
 Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates; Great Lakes Stock
Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units and Great Lakes Restricted Shares

 _

 SECTION 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Great Lakes ("Great Lakes Common Stock") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Crompton-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Great Lakes Common Stock that are owned by Great Lakes as treasury stock, and any shares of Great Lakes Common Stock owned by Crompton or Merger Sub, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 (c) _Conversion of Great Lakes Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2(e), each issued and outstanding share of Great Lakes Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive 2.2232 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Crompton ("Crompton Common Stock") (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Great Lakes Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Great Lakes Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b), without interest.

  

 SECTION 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Crompton shall deposit with the bank or trust company to be designated by Crompton and reasonably acceptable to Great Lakes (the "Exchange Agent"), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Crompton Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Great Lakes Common Stock (such shares of Crompton Common Stock, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

 

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Crompton shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Great Lakes Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form as Crompton and Great Lakes may reasonably agree to use and shall have such other provisions as Crompton and Great Lakes may reasonably agree to specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Certificates are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Crompton Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II after taking into account all the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock then held by such holder under all such Certificates so surrendered, (B) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and (C) any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Great Lakes, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Crompton Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if, upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall have paid, or pay, any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Crompton Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Crompton and the Exchange Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e), in each case without interest.

 

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Crompton Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Crompton Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Crompton Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), in each case until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Following surrender of any Certificate in accordance with this Article II, there shall be paid to the record holder thereof, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions, payable with respect to that number of whole shares of Crompton Common Stock issuable in exchange for such Certificate pursuant to this Article II, with a record date after the Effective Time and paid with respect to Crompton Common Stock prior to such surrender, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Crompton Common Stock.

 

 (d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Great Lakes Stock_. All shares of Crompton Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares paid pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of Great Lakes shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(g), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Crompton Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividends or other distributions of Crompton shall relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Crompton. In lieu of such fractional share interests, each holder of a Certificate shall receive (upon surrender thereof as provided in this Article II) an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such holder\'s proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2(e), on behalf of all such holders, of the Excess Shares. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Crompton Common Stock into which the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) before giving effect to the first sentence of this Section 2.2(e) over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of Crompton Common Stock to which the former holders of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) after giving effect to the first sentence of this Section 2.2(e) (such excess, the "Excess Shares"). As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the Certificates, shall sell the Excess Shares at the then-prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange. The sale of the Excess Shares on the New York Stock Exchange shall be executed through one or more member firms of the New York Stock Exchange and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall deduct from the proceeds of sale of the Excess Shares all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares. Until the net proceeds of such sale of the Excess Shares have been distributed to the holders of Certificates, the Exchange Agent will hold such net proceeds in trust for such holders of Certificates (the "Excess Shares Trust"). The portion of the Excess Shares Trust to which each holder of a Certificate shall be entitled, if any, shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Excess Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest in Crompton Common Stock to which such holder of a Certificate is entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests in Crompton Common Stock to which all holders of Certificates are entitled. Crompton shall comply with the provisions of Rule 236(c) under the Securities Act in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares.

 

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Crompton, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Crompton may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of such Certificate would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holder would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e), in each case pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 (g) _Termination of the Exchange Fund and the Excess Shares Trust_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund or the Excess Shares Trust that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Crompton, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Crompton for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Crompton Common Stock and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares in accordance with this Article II. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and all net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and all net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Crompton, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 (h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Crompton Common Stock (or dividends or other distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund or the Excess Shares Trust, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 (i) _Investment of the Exchange Fund and the Excess Shares Trust_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund or the Excess Shares Trust, as directed by Crompton. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be paid to, Crompton.

 

 (j) _Withholding Taxes_. Crompton and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock, Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units or Great Lakes Restricted Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, Crompton and the Exchange Agent shall be treated as though they withheld from the type of consideration from which withholding is required, an appropriate amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock, Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units or Great Lakes Restricted Shares in order to provide for such withholding obligation and such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock, Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units or Great Lakes Restricted Shares. If withholding is required from shares of Crompton Common Stock, Crompton and the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.

 

 SECTION 2.3. _Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units and Great Lakes Restricted Shares_.

 

 (a) _Great Lakes Stock Options_. Before the Closing, the Board of Directors of Great Lakes (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of Great Lakes administering the Great Lakes Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the following:

     

 (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding options to acquire shares of Great Lakes Common Stock (each, a "Great Lakes Stock Option") granted under Great Lakes\' 2002 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, 1998 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended, 1993 Employee Stock Compensation Plan, as amended, and 1984 Employee Stock Option Plan, as amended (collectively, the "Great Lakes Stock Plans"), whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Great Lakes Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the corresponding Great Lakes Stock Option (taking into account the terms of the Great Lakes Stock Plans, the individual award agreement pursuant to which the Great Lakes Stock Option was granted and any individual agreement providing for vesting of such Great Lakes Stock Option upon a change in control of Great Lakes), that number of shares of Crompton Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock subject to such Great Lakes Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, at a price per share of Crompton Common Stock equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Great Lakes Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Great Lakes Stock Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio (each Great Lakes Stock Option, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted Great Lakes Stock Option"), provided that the exercise price of the Adjusted Great Lakes Stock Option shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent; and

  

 (ii) make such other changes to the Great Lakes Stock Plans as Crompton and Great Lakes may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.

      

 (b) _Great Lakes Restricted Share Units_. Before the Closing, the Board of Directors of Great Lakes (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of Great Lakes administering the Great Lakes Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to adjust the terms of all outstanding restricted share units granted under the Great Lakes Stock Plans (each, a "Great Lakes Restricted Share Unit"), whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Great Lakes Restricted Share Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and converted into a restricted share unit to receive, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Great Lakes Restricted Share Unit (taking into account the terms of the Great Lakes Stock Plans, the individual award agreement pursuant to which the Great Lakes Restricted Share Unit was granted and any individual agreement providing for the vesting of such Great Lakes Restricted Share Unit upon a change in control of Great Lakes), that number of shares of Crompton Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock subject to such corresponding Great Lakes Restricted Share Unit by the Exchange Ratio (each Great Lakes Restricted Share Unit, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Share Unit").

  

 (c) _Great Lakes Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each share of Great Lakes Common Stock (other than any shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) which is subject to restrictions or forfeiture risks ("Great Lakes Restricted Shares") shall be converted to that number of shares of Crompton Common Stock ("Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Shares") as the holder of such Great Lakes Restricted Share would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had the Great Lakes Restricted Share not been subject to restrictions or forfeiture risks immediately prior to the Effective Time, which Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Share shall be subject to the same restrictions and forfeiture risks as applied to the corresponding Great Lakes Restricted Share.

 

 (d) The adjustments provided herein with respect to any Great Lakes Stock Options that are "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and the adjustments provided herein with respect to any Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units and Great Lakes Restricted Shares shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code (or a good faith interpretation thereof in the absence of definitive guidance thereunder).

 

 (e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any further corporate action, Crompton shall assume the Great Lakes Stock Plans, with the result that all obligations of Great Lakes under the Great Lakes Stock Plans, including with respect to Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units and Great Lakes Restricted Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (adjusted pursuant to Sections 2.3(a), (b) and (c)), shall be obligations of Crompton following the Effective Time. As of and after the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Crompton, or any committee thereof responsible for the administration of stock plans, shall take such action, including approving the issuance of shares of Crompton Common Stock, as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of Sections 2.3(a), (b) and (c).

 

 (f) On, or as soon as practicable (but in any event not more than three Business Days) after, the Closing Date, Crompton shall prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Crompton Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Crompton Common Stock subject to the Adjusted Great Lakes Stock Options and the Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Share Units. Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) at least for so long as any Adjusted Great Lakes Stock Options, Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Share Units or any unsettled awards granted under the Great Lakes Stock Plans after the Effective Time may remain outstanding.

 

 (g) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Crompton shall deliver to the holders of Adjusted Great Lakes Stock Options, Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Share Units and Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Shares appropriate notices setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the respective Great Lakes Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Adjusted Great Lakes Stock Options, Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Share Units and Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Shares and informing such holders that such Adjusted Great Lakes Stock Options, Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Share Units and Adjusted Great Lakes Restricted Shares have been assumed by Crompton and shall continue in effect from and after the Effective Time in accordance with their terms (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.3 after giving effect to the Merger).

 

 (h) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 2.3 and except to the extent required under the respective terms of the respective Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units and Great Lakes Restricted Shares (including any individual agreement providing for vesting of the applicable award upon a change in control of Great Lakes) all restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting with respect to Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units and Great Lakes Restricted Shares awarded under the Great Lakes Stock Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to such options, restricted share units or restricted shares after giving effect to the Merger and the assumption by Crompton as set forth above.

 

 

 SECTION 2.4. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in Section 5.1(a) or 5.1(b)), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Great Lakes Common Stock or Crompton Common Stock shall have been changed (or a provision for such change shall have been irrevocably made) into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio and other portions of this Agreement that would be affected by the number of such shares outstanding (including Section 2.3 and the limitations on dividends in Section 5.1) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

 


  
 ARTICLE III

Representations and Warranties of Great Lakes

 _

 Except as set forth in the Filed Great Lakes SEC Documents or in the disclosure schedule delivered by Great Lakes to Crompton simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the "Great Lakes Disclosure Schedule") and subject to Section 9.7(a), Great Lakes represents and warrants to Crompton and Merger Sub as follows:

 

 SECTION 3.1. _Organization; Standing; Corporate Power; Subsidiaries_.

 

 (a) Each of Great Lakes and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized and has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Great Lakes and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Great Lakes Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "Great Lakes Material Adverse Effect" shall mean (i) any change, event, occurrence or state of facts that is materially adverse to the business, assets and liabilities (contingent or otherwise), taken together, or financial condition of Great Lakes and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than to the extent based upon, resulting from or relating to any one or more of the following: (A) any change in the United States economy or securities or financial markets in general, (B) any change that generally affects the chemical industry which does not affect Great Lakes and its Subsidiaries to a materially greater extent than such change affects other Persons in the chemical industry, (C) any change in applicable Laws or in GAAP, (D) the negotiation, execution or public announcement of this Agreement, compliance with the terms of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including any impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers, distributors, partners or employees, or (E) any act of terrorism or war (whether or not threatened, pending or declared) or (ii) any change, event, occurrence or state of facts that would prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of Great Lakes to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall a change in the trading prices of Great Lakes Common Stock or the relative prices of Great Lakes Common Stock and Crompton Common Stock, by themselves, be considered to constitute a Great Lakes Material Adverse Effect.

 

 (b) All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each "significant subsidiary" (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) of Great Lakes (collectively, the "Great Lakes Significant Subsidiaries") have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by Great Lakes free and clear of all liens, pledges, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens").

Except as set forth above in this Section 3.2(a), at the close of business on March 8, 2005, no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Great Lakes were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. Except as set forth above in this Section 3.2(a), there are no outstanding stock appreciation rights, rights to receive shares of Great Lakes Common Stock on a deferred basis or other rights that are linked to the value of Great Lakes Common Stock granted under the Great Lakes Stock Plans or otherwise by Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Crompton shall provide Great Lakes (a) drafts of all consent solicitation materials that Crompton proposes to send to holders of Crompton\'s Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2010 (the "Crompton Floating Rate Notes") or Crompton\'s 9-7/8% Senior Notes due 2012 (the "Crompton 9-7/8% Notes" and, together with the Crompton Floating Rate Notes, the "Crompton Notes") seeking such holders\' consent to one or more amendments or to the waiver of one or more covenants (the "Merger Amendments") to (i) the Indenture, dated as of August 16, 2004, among Crompton, the guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, relating to the Crompton Floating Rate Notes (the "Crompton Floating Rate Notes Indenture"), and (ii) the Indenture, dated as of August 16, 2004, among Crompton, the guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, relating to the Crompton 9-7/8% Notes (the "Crompton 9-7/8% Notes Indenture" and, together with the Crompton Floating Rate Notes Indenture, the "Crompton 2004 Indentures") which provide that the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under either of the Crompton 2004 Indentures and (b) a reasonable opportunity to consult with Crompton as to the form and content of, and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on, such consent solicitation materials prior to the time that Crompton commences such consent solicitations (the "Crompton Consent Solicitations"). In addition, Crompton shall be entitled to seek in connection with the Crompton Consent Solicitations the consent of the holders of the Crompton Notes to one or more other amendments (collectively, the "Discretionary Amendments") to the Crompton 2004 Indentures so long as Crompton determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that seeking such Discretionary Amendments would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay obtaining such holders\' consent to the Merger Amendments; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Crompton elects to seek consent to a Discretionary Amendment and it thereafter becomes reasonably apparent that such consent cannot be obtained without preventing or materially delaying the Merger, Crompton shall promptly eliminate from the Crompton Consent Solicitations the request for consent to such Discretionary Amendment and continue to seek the Merger Amendments in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.14.

 

 SECTION 6.15. _Dividend Coordination_. Great Lakes shall coordinate with Crompton the declaration, setting of record dates and payment dates of dividends on Great Lakes Common Stock so that holders of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock do not receive a dividend on both Great Lakes Common Stock and Crompton Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of any calendar quarter or fail to receive a dividend on either Great Lakes Common Stock or Crompton Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of any calendar quarter.

 

 SECTION 6.16. _Filing of Annual Report on Form 10-K_. Crompton shall file its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 on or prior to March 16, 2005.

Crompton shall use its reasonable best efforts to have in full force and effect as of the Closing Date a new credit agreement or similar agreement that replaces the Crompton Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") under which the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not violate or otherwise cause a default under the New Credit Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Crompton shall not be required to comply with this Section 6.17 if it obtains the consent of the requisite percentage of lenders under the Crompton Credit Agreement to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Crompton shall consult with Great Lakes regarding, and shall provide Great Lakes with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on, such proposed New Credit Agreement prior to the execution thereof by Crompton.

the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 8, 2005,
among CROMPTON CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Crompton"), COPERNICUS
MERGER CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Crompton ("Merger Sub"), and Great Lakes, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into Great Lakes (the "Merger"), and in connection with the Merger, the
undersigned is entitled to receive common stock, par value $0.01 per share

If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act, the
undersigned\'s ability to sell, assign or transfer the shares of Crompton
Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of Great
Lakes Common Stock in connection with the Merger may be restricted unless such
transaction is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions
are limited and the undersigned has obtained or will obtain advice of counsel
as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with
respect to the applicability to the sale of such securities of Rules 144 and
145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act. The undersigned understands that
Crompton will not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any
registration statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale of
Crompton Common Stock by the undersigned.

 

The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Crompton that the
undersigned will not sell, assign or transfer any of the shares of Crompton
Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for shares of Great Lakes
Common Stock in connection with the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective

to a transaction to be engaged in by the undersigned, is not required to be
registered under the Securities Act.

 

In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of the shares
of Crompton Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, the undersigned will supply

Crompton with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of a letter
in the form of Annex I hereto or the opinion of counsel or no-action letter
referred to above. The undersigned understands that Crompton may instruct its
transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any shares of Crompton Common Stock
disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided such transfer is not
prohibited by any other provision of this letter agreement) upon receipt of
such evidence of compliance, Crompton shall cause the transfer agent to
effectuate the transfer of the shares of Crompton Common Stock sold as
indicated in such letter.

 

Crompton covenants that it will take all such actions as may be reasonably
available to it to permit the sale or other disposition of the shares of
Crompton Common Stock by the undersigned under Rule 145 in accordance with the
terms thereof.

 

The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the legend set forth below will
be placed on certificates representing the shares of Crompton Common Stock
received by the undersigned in connection with the Merger or held by a
transferee thereof, which legend will be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates upon receipt of an opinion from counsel to the effect that such
legend is no longer required for purposes of the Securities Act.

 

There will be placed on the certificates for Crompton Common Stock issued to
the undersigned in connection with the Merger, or any substitutions therefor,
a legend stating in substance:

   

"The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The

connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities
Act of 1933. The shares may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred
except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933."

   

It is understood and agreed that certificates with the legend set forth above
will be substituted by delivery of certificates without such legends if (i)
one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the
Crompton Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule
145(c)(2) are then available, (ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date
the undersigned acquired the Crompton Common Stock received in the Merger and
the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then available or (iii) Crompton has
received either a written opinion of counsel, or a "no action" letter obtained
by the undersigned from the SEC, to the effect that the restrictions imposed
by Rule 145 under the Securities Act no longer apply to the undersigned.

 

The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read this
letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed
upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Crompton Common
Stock and (ii) the receipt by Crompton of this letter is an inducement to

GREAT LAKES CHEMICAL CORPORATION 
 CERTIFICATE

 

In connection with the merger of Copernicus Merger Corporation ("Merger Sub"),
a Delaware corporation and a directly wholly-owned subsidiary of Crompton
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Crompton"), with and into Great Lakes
Chemical Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Great Lakes"), pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 8, 2005 (the "Merger
Agreement"), among Crompton, Merger Sub, and Great Lakes, Great Lakes hereby
certifies the following are now true and will continue to be true as of the
Effective Time and thereafter where relevant (any capitalized term used but
not defined herein having the meaning given to such term in the Merger
Agreement):

   

  

 1. The consideration to be received in the Merger by the stockholders of Great Lakes was the result of arm\'s-length bargaining between the managements of Great Lakes and Crompton. The fair market value of the common stock of Crompton ("Crompton Common Stock") and any cash received in lieu of fractional shares to be received by each stockholder of Great Lakes will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the common stock of Great Lakes ("Great Lakes Common Stock") surrendered in the Merger. 
 Prior to and in connection with the Merger, no outstanding stock of Great
Lakes has been or will be (i) redeemed by Great Lakes, or (ii) acquired by a
person related to Great Lakes (with the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e)(3) determined without regard to Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e)(3)(i)(A)) for consideration other than Crompton Common Stock or
Great Lakes Common Stock.

 

 2. To the best knowledge of Great Lakes, there is no plan or intention on the part of any stockholders of Great Lakes to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of Crompton Common Stock to be received in the Merger by such holder of Great Lakes Common Stock directly or indirectly to Crompton or to a person related to Crompton (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) for consideration other than Crompton Common Stock.
 

 3. Great Lakes has no outstanding equity interests other than as described in Section 3.2 of the Merger Agreement. At the Effective Time and following the Merger, Great Lakes will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any person could acquire stock in Great Lakes that, if exercised or converted, would affect Crompton\'s acquisition or retention of "control" of Great Lakes within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
 

 4. Great Lakes has no plan or intention to alter the terms of the Great Lakes Common Stock or to issue additional shares of its stock that would result in Crompton losing "control" of Great Lakes within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.
 

 5. Holders of Great Lakes Common Stock do not have dissenter\'s rights in connection with the Merger.
 

 6. Great Lakes and its stockholders will pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger, except that the costs and expenses described in Section 6.5 of the Merger Agreement shall be borne by the parties in accordance therewith.
 

 7. Great Lakes is not an investment company as defined in Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.
 

 8. Great Lakes is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.
 

 9. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Crompton and Great Lakes or between Merger Sub and Great Lakes that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.
 

 10. In the Merger, shares of Great Lakes Common Stock representing control of Great Lakes within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code will be exchanged solely for Crompton Common Stock. In connection with the Merger, no shares of Great Lakes Common Stock will be exchanged for cash or other property originating with Crompton or any person related to Crompton (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) except for cash received by holders of Great Lakes Common Stock in lieu of fractional shares of Crompton Common Stock. Further, no liabilities of Great Lakes or of the stockholders of Great Lakes will be assumed by Crompton, nor to the best of the knowledge of the management of Great Lakes, will any Great Lakes Common Stock be subject to any liabilities.
 

 11. In connection with the Merger, Great Lakes has not sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of any of its assets as would prevent Crompton or members of its qualified group (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) from causing Great Lakes after the Merger to continue the historic business of Great Lakes or to use a significant portion of Great Lakes\' historic business assets in a business.
 

 12. On the date of the Merger, the fair market value of the assets of Great Lakes will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.
 

 13. Following the Merger, Great Lakes will hold at least 90% of the fair market value of its net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of its gross assets held immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, amounts paid by Great Lakes to Great Lakes stockholders who receive cash or other property in the Merger, amounts used by Great Lakes to pay its reorganization expenses and those of its stockholders, and all redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends) made by Great Lakes will be included as assets of Great Lakes immediately prior to the Merger.
 

 14. None of the compensation to be received by any stockholder-employee of Great Lakes in the Merger will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares of Great Lakes Common Stock; none of the Crompton Common Stock to be received by any stockholder-employee of Great Lakes will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment or consulting agreement; and the compensation to be paid to any stockholder-employee after the Merger pursuant to arrangements entered into in connection with the Merger will be for services actually rendered and will be commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm\'s-length for similar services.
 

 15. All options, warrants, or rights to acquire shares of Great Lakes Common Stock were issued with an exercise price no less than fair market value at the time of issue.
 

 16. The Merger is being effected for bona fide business reasons, as described in the Joint Proxy Statement.
 

 17. The Merger Agreement (including all exhibits and attachments thereto) represents the full and complete agreement between Crompton and Great Lakes regarding the Merger, and there are no other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger.
 

 18. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Crompton Common Stock in the Merger is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Crompton of issuing fractional shares, if any, and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to holders of Great Lakes Common Stock in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Crompton Common Stock will not exceed one percent (1%) of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to holders of Great Lakes Common Stock in exchange for their Great Lakes Common Stock.

   

The undersigned recognizes that opinions issued by counsel of Crompton and
Great Lakes regarding certain federal income tax consequences of the Merger
("Tax Opinions") will be based on the representations set forth herein and on
the statements contained in the Merger Agreement and documents related
thereto. The Tax Opinions will be subject to certain limitations and
qualifications including that they may not be relied upon if any such
representations are not accurate in all respects.
