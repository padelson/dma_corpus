</U><P><A NAME="_Toc98093908">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Effect on Capital Stock</U>.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Great Lakes ("Great Lakes Common Stock") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Capital Stock of Merger Sub</U>.  Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Crompton-Owned Stock</U>.  Any shares of Great Lakes Common Stock that are owned by Great Lakes as treasury stock, and any shares of Great Lakes Common Stock owned by Crompton or Merger Sub, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Conversion of Great Lakes Common Stock</U>.  Subject to Section&nbsp;2.2(e), each issued and outstanding share of Great Lakes Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive 2.2232 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Crompton ("Crompton Common Stock") (the "Merger Consideration").  As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Great Lakes Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Great Lakes Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b), without interest.</P>

<P><A NAME="_Toc98093909">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Exchange of Certificates</U>.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Exchange Agent</U>.  As of the Effective Time, Crompton shall deposit with the bank or trust company to be designated by Crompton and reasonably acceptable to Great Lakes (the "Exchange Agent"), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Crompton Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Great Lakes Common Stock (such shares of Crompton Common Stock, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Exchange Procedures</U>.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Crompton shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Great Lakes Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form as Crompton and Great Lakes may reasonably agree to use and shall have such other provisions as Crompton and Great Lakes may reasonably agree to specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Certificates are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e).  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Crompton Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II after taking into account all the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock then held by such holder under all such Certificates so surrendered, (B) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and (C) any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Great Lakes, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Crompton Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if, upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall have paid, or pay, any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Crompton Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Crompton and the Exchange Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(e), in each case without interest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares</U>.  No dividends or other distributions with respect to Crompton Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Crompton Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Crompton Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), in each case until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.  Following surrender of any Certificate in accordance with this Article II, there shall be paid to the record holder thereof, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions, payable with respect to that number of whole shares of Crompton Common Stock issuable in exchange for such Certificate pursuant to this Article II, with a record date after the Effective Time and paid with respect to Crompton Common Stock prior to such surrender, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Crompton Common Stock.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Great Lakes Stock</U>.  All shares of Crompton Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares paid pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of Great Lakes shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(g), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Fractional Shares</U>.  No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Crompton Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividends or other distributions of Crompton shall relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Crompton.  In lieu of such fractional share interests, each holder of a Certificate shall receive (upon surrender thereof as provided in this Article II) an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.2(e), on behalf of all such holders, of the Excess Shares.  As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Crompton Common Stock into which the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) before giving effect to the first sentence of this Section 2.2(e) over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of Crompton Common Stock to which the former holders of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) after giving effect to the first sentence of this Section&nbsp;2.2(e) (such excess, the "Excess Shares").  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the Certificates, shall sell the Excess Shares at the then-prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange.  The sale of the Excess Shares on the New York Stock Exchange shall be executed through one or more member firms of the New York Stock Exchange and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.  The Exchange Agent shall deduct from the proceeds of sale of the Excess Shares all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares.  Until the net proceeds of such sale of the Excess Shares have been distributed to the holders of Certificates, the Exchange Agent will hold such net proceeds in trust for such holders of Certificates (the "Excess Shares Trust").  The portion of the Excess Shares Trust to which each holder of a Certificate shall be entitled, if any, shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Excess Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest in Crompton Common Stock to which such holder of a Certificate is entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests in Crompton Common Stock to which all holders of Certificates are entitled.  Crompton shall comply with the provisions of Rule 236(c) under the Securities Act in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</U>.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Crompton, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Crompton may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of such Certificate would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares to which such holder would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e), in each case pursuant to this Agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination of the Exchange Fund and the Excess Shares Trust</U>.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund or the Excess Shares Trust that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Crompton, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Crompton for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Crompton Common Stock and any net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares in accordance with this Article II.  If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and all net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and all net cash proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Crompton, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Liability</U>.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Crompton Common Stock (or dividends or other distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund or the Excess Shares Trust, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Investment of the Exchange Fund and the Excess Shares Trust</U>.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund or the Excess Shares Trust, as directed by Crompton.  Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be paid to, Crompton.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Withholding Taxes</U>.  Crompton and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock, Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units or Great Lakes Restricted Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.  To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, Crompton and the Exchange Agent shall be treated as though they withheld from the type of consideration from which withholding is required, an appropriate amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Great Lakes Common Stock, Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units or Great Lakes Restricted Shares in order to provide for such withholding obligation and such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock, Great Lakes Stock Options, Great Lakes Restricted Share Units or Great Lakes Restricted Shares.  If withholding is required from shares of Crompton Common Stock, Crompton and the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Great Lakes Stock Options</U>.  Before the Closing, the Board of Directors of Great Lakes (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of Great Lakes administering the Great Lakes Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the following:</P><DIR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make such other changes to the Great Lakes Stock Plans as Crompton and Great Lakes may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Great Lakes Restricted Share Units</U>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Great Lakes Restricted Shares</U>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.11(a) of Great Lakes Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), and all other material employee benefit plans, policies, agreements, arrangements or payroll practices, including employment, individual consulting or other compensation agreements, or bonus or other incentive compensation, stock purchase, equity or equity-based compensation, deferred compensation, change in control, retention, severance, sick leave, vacation pay, employee loans, salary continuation, health insurance, life insurance and educational assistance plan, policies, agreements or arrangements with respect to which Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for current or former employees, individual consultants or directors of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Great Lakes Plans").  Section 3.11(a) of Great Lakes Disclosure Schedule separately sets forth each Great Lakes Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a "Title IV Plan") or is a "multiemployer plan", as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan"), or is or has been subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True and complete copies of the following documents with respect to each of the Great Lakes Plans (other than a Multiemployer Plan) have been made available to Crompton by Great Lakes to the extent applicable:  (i) any plans and related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements, and all amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent Forms 5500 and all schedules thereto, (iii) the most recent actuarial report, if any; (iv) the most recent IRS determination letter; (v) the most recent summary plan descriptions; and (vi) written summaries of all non-written Great Lakes Plans.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Lakes Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 or other tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code are so qualified, and any trusts intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under the Code are so exempt.  Nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of the Great Lakes Plans that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption, or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither Great Lakes nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to contribute to, or otherwise has any liability with respect to, a Multiemployer Plan.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "benefit liabilities" as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA of each Title IV Plan using the actuarial assumptions used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") to determine the level of funding required in the event of the termination of such Title IV Plan do not exceed the assets of such Title IV Plan.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits arising from or relating to the Great Lakes Plans, or the assets thereof (in each case, other than routine benefit claims), nor does Great Lakes have any Knowledge of facts that would form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Great Lakes Material Adverse Effect.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the Great Lakes Plans provide for post-employment life insurance or health coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant, except as may be required under Part 6 of the Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Section&nbsp;4980B of the Code or similar provisions of applicable state Law and at the expense of the participant or the participant's beneficiary.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment becoming due to any current or former employee of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries (under any of the Great Lakes Plans or otherwise), (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable to any current or former employee of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the Great Lakes Plans, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment of or vesting of any rights with respect to such benefits under any of the Great Lakes Plans, or (iv) require any contributions or payments to fund any obligations under any of the Great Lakes Plans.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Knowledge of Great Lakes, any individual who performs services for Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries (other than through a contract with an organization other than such individual) and who is not treated as an employee of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries for Federal income tax purposes by Great Lakes is not an employee for such purposes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the employees of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries is represented in his or her capacity as an employee of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries by any labor organization, and neither Great Lakes nor any of its Subsidiaries has recognized any labor organization, nor has any labor organization been elected as the collective bargaining agent of any employees of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries entered into any collective bargaining agreement or union contract recognizing any labor organization as the bargaining agent of any employees of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries.  There is no union organization activity involving any of the employees of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of Great Lakes, threatened that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Great Lakes Material Adverse Effect.  There is no picketing pending or, to the Knowledge of Great Lakes, threatened, and there are no strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, other job actions, lockouts, arbitrations, grievances or other labor disputes involving any of the employees of Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of Great Lakes, threatened that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Great Lakes Material Adverse Effect.  There are no complaints, charges or claims against Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of Great Lakes, threatened that could be brought by or filed with any Governmental Authority or arbitrator based on, arising out of, in connection with or otherwise relating to the employment or termination of employment or failure to employ by Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries, of any individual that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Great Lakes Material Adverse Effect.

In the six years preceding the date hereof, there has been no "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (as defined by WARN) with respect to Great Lakes or any of its Subsidiaries.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4.11(a) of Crompton Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of  "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), and all other material employee benefit plans, policies, agreements, arrangements or payroll practices, including employment, individual consulting or other compensation agreements, or bonus or other incentive compensation, stock purchase, equity or equity-based compensation, deferred compensation, change in control, retention, severance, sick leave, vacation pay, employee loans, salary continuation, health insurance, life insurance and educational assistance plan, policies, agreements or arrangements with respect to which Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for current or former employees, individual consultants or directors of Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Crompton Plans").  Section&nbsp;4.11(a) of Crompton Disclosure Schedule separately sets forth each Crompton Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or is a Multiemployer Plan, or is or has been subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True and complete copies of the following documents with respect to each of the Crompton Plans (other than a Multiemployer Plan) have been made available to Great Lakes by Crompton to the extent applicable:  (i) any plans and related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements, and all amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent Forms 5500 and all schedules thereto, (iii) the most recent actuarial report, if any; (iv) the most recent IRS determination letter; (v) the most recent summary plan descriptions; and (vi) written summaries of all non-written Crompton Plans.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crompton Plans have been maintained, in form and operation in all material respects, in accordance with their terms and with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Laws.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crompton Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 or other tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code are so qualified, and any trusts intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under the Code are so exempt.  Nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of the Crompton Plans that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption, or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither Crompton nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to contribute to, or otherwise has any liability with respect to, a Multiemployer Plan.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All contributions required to have been made under any of the Crompton Plans or by law (without regard to any waivers granted under Section 412 of the Code), have been timely made, and no accumulated funding deficiencies exist in any of Crompton Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "benefit liabilities" as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA of each Title IV Plan using the actuarial assumptions used by the PBGC to determine the level of funding required in the event of the termination of such Title IV Plan do not exceed the assets of such Title IV Plan.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits arising from or relating to the Crompton Plans, or the assets thereof (in each case, other than routine benefit claims), nor does Crompton have any Knowledge of facts that would form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Crompton Material Adverse Effect.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the Crompton Plans provide for post-employment life insurance or health coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant, except as may be required under Part 6 of the Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Section&nbsp;4980B of the Code or similar provisions of applicable state Law and at the expense of the participant or the participant's beneficiary.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment becoming due to any current or former employee of Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries (under any of the Crompton Plans or otherwise), (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable to any current or former employee of Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the Crompton Plans, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment of or vesting of any rights with respect to such benefits under any of the Crompton Plans, or (iv) require any contributions or payments to fund any obligations under any of the Crompton Plans. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Knowledge of Crompton, any individual who performs services for Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries (other than through a contract with an organization other than such individual) and who is not treated as an employee of Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries for Federal income tax purposes by Crompton is not an employee for such purposes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the employees of Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries is represented in his or her capacity as an employee of Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries by any labor organization.  Neither Crompton nor any of its Subsidiaries has recognized any labor organization, nor has any labor organization been elected as the collective bargaining agent of any employees of Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries entered into any collective bargaining agreement or union contract recognizing any labor organization as the bargaining agent of any employees of Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries.  There is no union organization activity involving any of the employees of Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of Crompton, threatened that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Crompton Material Adverse Effect.  There is no picketing pending or, to the Knowledge of Crompton, threatened, and there are no strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, other job actions, lockouts, arbitrations, grievances or other labor disputes involving any of the employees of Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of Crompton, threatened that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Crompton Material Adverse Effect.  There are no complaints, charges or claims against Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of Crompton, threatened that could be brought by or filed with any Governmental Authority or arbitrator based on, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the employment or termination of employment or failure to employ by Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries, of any individual that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Crompton Material Adverse Effect.  Crompton and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all Laws relating to the employment of labor, including all such Laws relating to wages, hours, WARN, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety and health, workers' compensation and the collection and payment of withholding and/or social security taxes and any similar tax.  In the six years preceding the date hereof, there has been no "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (as defined by WARN) with respect to Crompton or any of its Subsidiaries.</P>

Great Lakes shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Great Lakes Takeover Proposal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt of the Great Lakes Stockholder Approval, in response to a Great Lakes Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of Great Lakes determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Great Lakes Superior Proposal, and which Great Lakes Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2(a), Great Lakes may (A)&nbsp;furnish information with respect to Great Lakes and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Great Lakes Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement that does not contain terms that would prevent Great Lakes from complying with its obligations under this Section&nbsp;5.2, and (B)&nbsp;participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Great Lakes Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Great Lakes Takeover Proposal.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Agreement, "Great Lakes Superior Proposal" shall mean any written, bona fide offer made by a third party that if consummated would result in such Person (or its shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the shares of Great Lakes Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or 50% or more of the total consolidated assets of Great Lakes, which the Board of Directors of Great Lakes determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to the stockholders of Great Lakes than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement).</P>

Crompton agrees that its payment obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of this Agreement against the Surviving Corporation or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor (other than the defenses of statute of limitations, which are not waived).  Crompton hereby acknowledges that its obligations under this Section 6.4 constitute a guaranty of payment and not merely of collectability and Crompton hereby waives (i)&nbsp;promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and order in connection with this guarantee and (ii) any requirement that any party enforcing the guarantee exhaust any right to take any action against the Surviving Corporation or any other person prior to or contemporaneously with proceeding to exercise any right against Crompton hereunder.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crompton shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors of Crompton at the Effective Time to be eleven.

Crompton shall use its best efforts to cause each Great Lakes Board Designee whose term expires in 2006 or 2007 to be re-nominated for one additional term, unless such Great Lakes Board Designee does not meet Crompton's board membership criteria then in effect or such Great Lakes Board Designee is the Great Lakes Board Designee designated to resign from or not seek re-election to the Board of Directors of Crompton under Section&nbsp;6.13(b).  For purposes of this Agreement, "Great Lakes Board Designees" shall mean the five individuals, each of whom must be serving as a member of the Board of Directors of Great Lakes as of the date of this Agreement, designated by Great Lakes in writing prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement to be elected to the Board of Directors of Crompton as of, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time.  The Great Lakes Board Designees shall be allocated among the various classes of the Board of Directors of Crompton in a manner to be reasonably agreed upon by Great Lakes and Crompton prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, <U>provided</U> that the total number of directors in each of Class I, Class II and Class III shall be as nearly equal in number as possible.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders of Crompton, Crompton shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors of Crompton to be nine.  In order to achieve such reduced number of directors, Crompton shall cause one Great Lakes Board Designee and one of the Original Crompton Board Members to either resign from or to not seek re-election to the Board of Directors of Crompton as of or at the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders of Crompton.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section&nbsp;6.13, after the Effective Time, Crompton shall have the right, and shall be permitted, to take any action inconsistent with Sections&nbsp;6.13(a) and 6.13(b) if, after the Effective Time, the entire Board of Directors of Crompton unanimously approves the taking of such action.</P>

Crompton shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the condition to Closing set forth in Section 7.1(f) to be satisfied as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (it being understood that the use of such reasonable best efforts shall include the preparation and commencement of the Crompton Consent Solicitations), and Great Lakes shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Crompton in connection therewith.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Crompton shall provide Great Lakes (a)&nbsp;drafts of all consent solicitation materials that Crompton proposes to send to holders of Crompton's Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2010 (the "Crompton Floating Rate Notes") or Crompton's 9-7/8% Senior Notes due 2012 (the "Crompton 9-7/8% Notes" and, together with the Crompton Floating Rate Notes, the "Crompton Notes") seeking such holders' consent to one or more amendments or to the waiver of one or more covenants (the "Merger Amendments") to (i)&nbsp;the Indenture, dated as of August 16, 2004, among Crompton, the guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, relating to the Crompton Floating Rate Notes (the "Crompton Floating Rate Notes Indenture"), and (ii)&nbsp;the Indenture, dated as of August 16, 2004, among Crompton, the guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, relating to the Crompton 9-7/8% Notes (the "Crompton 9-7/8% Notes Indenture" and, together with the Crompton Floating Rate Notes Indenture, the "Crompton 2004 Indentures") which provide that the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under either of the Crompton 2004 Indentures and (b)&nbsp;a reasonable opportunity to consult with Crompton as to the form and content of, and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on, such consent solicitation materials prior to the time that Crompton commences such consent solicitations (the "Crompton Consent Solicitations").  In addition, Crompton shall be entitled to seek in connection with the Crompton Consent Solicitations the consent of the holders of the Crompton Notes to one or more other amendments (collectively, the "Discretionary Amendments") to the Crompton 2004 Indentures so long as Crompton determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that seeking such Discretionary Amendments would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay obtaining such holders' consent to the Merger Amendments; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if Crompton elects to seek consent to a Discretionary Amendment and it thereafter becomes reasonably apparent that such consent cannot be obtained without preventing or materially delaying the Merger, Crompton shall promptly eliminate from the Crompton Consent Solicitations the request for consent to such Discretionary Amendment and continue to seek the Merger Amendments in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.14.</A></P>

CERTIFICATE</P>
<P>In connection with the merger of Copernicus Merger Corporation ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and a directly wholly-owned subsidiary of Crompton Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Crompton"), with and into Great Lakes Chemical Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Great Lakes"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 8, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Crompton, Merger Sub, and Great Lakes, Great Lakes hereby certifies the following are now true and will continue to be true as of the Effective Time and thereafter where relevant (any capitalized term used but not defined herein having the meaning given to such term in the Merger Agreement):</P>


<OL>

<LI>The consideration to be received in the Merger by the stockholders of Great Lakes was the result of arm's-length bargaining between the managements of Great Lakes and Crompton.  The fair market value of the common stock of Crompton ("Crompton Common Stock") and any cash received in lieu of fractional shares to be received by each stockholder of Great Lakes will be approximately equal  to the fair market value of the common stock of Great Lakes ("Great Lakes Common Stock") surrendered in the Merger. </A></LI>
Prior to and in connection with the Merger, no outstanding stock of Great Lakes has been or will be (i) redeemed by Great Lakes, or (ii) acquired by a person related to Great Lakes (with the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3) determined without regard to Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)(i)(A)) for consideration other than Crompton&nbsp;Common Stock or Great Lakes Common Stock.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094002">To the best knowledge of Great Lakes, there is no plan or intention on the part of any stockholders of Great Lakes to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of Crompton Common Stock to be received in the Merger by such holder of Great Lakes Common Stock directly or indirectly to Crompton or to a person related to Crompton (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) for consideration other than Crompton Common Stock.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094003">Great Lakes has no outstanding equity interests other than as described in Section 3.2 of the Merger Agreement.  At the Effective Time and following the Merger, Great Lakes will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any person could acquire stock in Great Lakes that, if exercised or converted, would affect Crompton's acquisition or retention of "control" of Great Lakes within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094004">Great Lakes has no plan or intention to alter the terms of the Great Lakes Common Stock or to issue additional shares of its stock that would result in Crompton losing "control" of Great Lakes within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094005">Holders of Great Lakes Common Stock do not have dissenter's rights in connection with the Merger.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094006">Great Lakes and its stockholders will pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger, except that the costs and expenses described in Section 6.5 of the Merger Agreement shall be borne by the parties in accordance therewith.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094007">Great Lakes is not an investment company as defined in Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094008">Great Lakes is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094009">There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Crompton and Great Lakes or between Merger Sub and Great Lakes that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094010">In the Merger, shares of Great Lakes Common Stock representing control of Great Lakes within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code will be exchanged solely for Crompton Common Stock.  In connection with the Merger, no shares of Great Lakes Common Stock will be exchanged for cash or other property originating with Crompton or any person related to Crompton (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) except for cash received by holders of Great Lakes Common Stock in lieu of fractional shares of Crompton Common Stock.  Further, no liabilities of Great Lakes or of the stockholders of Great Lakes will be assumed by Crompton, nor to the best of the knowledge of the management of Great Lakes, will any Great Lakes Common Stock be subject to any liabilities.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094011">In connection with the Merger, Great Lakes has not sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of any of its assets as would prevent Crompton or members of its qualified group (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) from causing Great Lakes after the Merger to continue the historic business of Great Lakes or to use a significant portion of Great Lakes' historic business assets in a business.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094012">On the date of the Merger, the fair market value of the assets of Great Lakes will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094013">Following the Merger, Great Lakes will hold at least 90% of the fair market value of its net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of its gross assets held immediately prior to the Merger.  For purposes of this representation, amounts paid by Great Lakes to Great Lakes stockholders who receive cash or other property in the Merger, amounts used by Great Lakes to pay its reorganization expenses and those of its stockholders, and all redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends) made by Great Lakes will be included as assets of Great Lakes immediately prior to the Merger.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094014">None of the compensation to be received by any stockholder-employee of Great Lakes in the Merger will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares of Great Lakes Common Stock; none of the Crompton Common Stock to be received by any stockholder-employee of Great Lakes will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment or consulting agreement; and the compensation to be paid to any stockholder-employee after the Merger pursuant to arrangements entered into in connection with the Merger will be for services actually rendered and will be commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's-length for similar services.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094015">All options, warrants, or rights to acquire shares of Great Lakes Common Stock were issued with an exercise price no less than fair market value at the time of issue.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094016">The Merger is being effected for bona fide business reasons, as described in the Joint Proxy Statement.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094017">The Merger Agreement (including all exhibits and attachments thereto) represents the full and complete agreement between Crompton and Great Lakes regarding the Merger, and there are no other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger.</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc98094018">The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Crompton Common Stock in the Merger is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Crompton of issuing fractional shares, if any, and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration.  The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to holders of Great Lakes Common Stock in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Crompton Common Stock will not exceed one percent (1%) of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to holders of Great Lakes Common Stock in exchange for their Great Lakes Common Stock.</A></LI></OL>

<OL>

<OL>

<LI>The consideration to be issued in the Merger to the stockholders of Great Lakes was the result of arm's-length negotiation between the managements of Crompton and Great Lakes.  The fair market value of the common stock of Crompton ("Crompton Common Stock") and any cash in lieu of fractional shares to be received by each stockholder of Great Lakes will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the common stock of Great Lakes ("Great Lakes Common Stock") surrendered in the Merger.</LI>
<LI>In connection with the Merger, none of the Great Lakes Common Stock will be acquired by Crompton or any person related to Crompton (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) for consideration other than Crompton Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional share interests therein. </LI>
<LI>In the Merger, shares of Great Lakes Common Stock representing control of Great Lakes, as defined in Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), will be exchanged solely for Crompton Common Stock.  In connection with the Merger, no shares of Great Lakes Common Stock will be exchanged for cash or other property originating with Crompton or any person related to Crompton (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)).  Further, no liabilities of Great Lakes or of the stockholders of Great Lakes will be assumed by Crompton, nor to the best knowledge of the management of Crompton, will any Great Lakes Common Stock be subject to any liabilities.</LI>
<LI>Following the Merger, Crompton will cause Great Lakes to hold at least 90% of the fair market value of its net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of its gross assets held immediately prior to the Merger and at least 90% of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of the gross assets of Merger Sub held immediately before the Merger.  For purposes of this representation, assets transferred from Crompton to Merger Sub are not included as assets of Merger Sub immediately before the Merger where such assets are used to pay reorganization expenses, to pay creditors of Great Lakes or to enable Merger Sub to satisfy state minimum capitalization requirements (where the money is returned to Crompton as part of the transaction). </LI>
<LI>Following the Merger, the historic business of Great Lakes will be continued by, or a significant portion of Great Lakes' historic business assets will be used in a business of, Crompton or a corporation within Crompton's qualified group (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)).  </LI>
<LI>Crompton has no plan or intention to liquidate Great Lakes; to merge Great Lakes with or into another corporation; to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of Great Lakes Common Stock acquired in the Merger except for transfers or successive transfers of Great Lakes Common Stock to one or more corporations controlled (within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code) in each case by the transferor; or to cause Great Lakes to sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets or of any of the assets acquired from Merger Sub, except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers or successive transfers of assets to one or more corporations controlled (within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code) in each case by the transferor corporation.  </LI>
<LI>In connection with the Merger, neither Crompton nor any person related to Crompton (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) will purchase, exchange, redeem, or otherwise acquire (directly or indirectly) any Crompton Common Stock issued to holders of Great Lakes Common Stock in the Merger.</LI>
<LI>Holders of Great Lakes Common Stock do not have dissenter's rights in connection with the Merger.</LI>
<LI>Crompton and Merger Sub will pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger, except that the costs and expenses described in Section 6.5 of the Merger Agreement shall be borne by the parties in accordance therewith.  Crompton will not pay any of the expenses of the stockholders of Great Lakes incurred in connection with the Merger.</LI>
<LI>Neither Crompton nor any person related to Crompton (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) has owned any stock of Great Lakes during the past five (5) years.</LI>
<LI>Neither Crompton nor Merger Sub is an investment company as defined in Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.</LI>
<LI>At the Effective Time, Crompton will be in control of Merger Sub within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.</LI>
<LI>Crompton has no plan or intention to cause Great Lakes to alter the terms of the Great Lakes Common Stock or to issue additional shares of its stock that would result in Crompton losing control of Great Lakes within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code. </LI>
<LI>There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Crompton and Great Lakes or between Merger Sub and Great Lakes that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.</LI>
<LI>Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by Great Lakes, and will not transfer to Great Lakes any assets subject to liabilities, in the Merger.</LI>
<LI>None of the compensation to be received by any stockholder-employee of Great Lakes will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of such person's shares of Great Lakes Common Stock; none of the shares of Crompton Common Stock to be received by any stockholder-employee of Great Lakes in the Merger will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any past or future services; and the compensation to be paid to any stockholder-employee after the Merger will be for services actually rendered and will be commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's-length for similar services.</LI>
<LI>The Merger is being effected for bona fide business reasons, as described in the Joint Proxy Statement.  </LI>
<LI>The Merger Agreement (including all exhibits and attachments thereto) represents the full and complete agreement between Crompton and Great Lakes regarding the Merger, and there are no other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger.</LI>

<LI>Crompton Common Stock entitles the holder to vote for the election of the board of directors of Crompton.</LI>
<LI>No holder of Great Lakes Common Stock is acting as agent for Crompton in connection with the Merger or approval thereof, and neither Crompton nor Merger Sub will reimburse any holder of Great Lakes Common Stock for the Great Lakes Common Stock such holder may have purchased, or for other obligations such holder may have incurred, as agent for Crompton or Merger Sub.</LI></OL>
