ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

Section 2.01. _The Merger._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, at the Effective Time, in accordance with Sections 350 and
351 of the Companies Law and the provisions of the Court Approval, Merger
Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company, whereupon
the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall
be the surviving company (the "Surviving Company"). From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall possess all the rights, powers,
privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under the applicable provisions of the
Companies Law.

(b) The consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 1600 El Camino Real, Menlo Park,



 

10 California 94025, on a date and at a time to be agreed upon by Parent and the
Company, which date shall be no later than two Business Days after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions
to the Merger set forth in Article 9 (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other location,
date and time as Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company shall mutually
agree upon in writing (the date upon which the Closing occurs, the "Closing
Date" or the "Effective Time", as applicable).

Section 2.02. _Effect on Share Capital._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of,
and simultaneously with the Merger, and without any further action on the part
of Parent, the Company or Merger Subsidiary:

(a) except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.02(b) and 2.02(c), each
Company Ordinary Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be transferred to Parent and shall be registered in the name of Parent
in the shareholder register of the Surviving Company, in consideration for
the right to receive $8.25 in cash, without interest and 0.1498 shares of
Parent Common Stock (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock as specified below, the "Merger Consideration");

(b) no payment shall be made with respect to any Company Ordinary Shares held
by the Company or dormant shares ( _minayot radumot_ ) immediately prior to
the Effective Time; and

(c) no payment shall be made with respect to any Company Ordinary Share held
by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration (i) certificates representing Company Ordinary Shares (the
"Certificates"), or (ii) uncertificated Company Ordinary Shares (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall have made
available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Company Ordinary Shares at the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such
provisions and instructions as Parent may reasonably specify and the Company
may reasonably approve prior to the Effective Time (including provision that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated
Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.



 

11 (b) Except as set forth in Sections 2.02(b) and 2.02(c), each holder of
Company Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of each Company Ordinary Share
represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. The shares of
Parent Common Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at
Parents option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical
certificate is requested by a holder of Company Ordinary Shares or is
otherwise required under Applicable Law. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Company, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Ordinary Shares six
months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged such shares for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Company Ordinary Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Company Ordinary
Shares for any amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Company Ordinary Shares two years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts
would



 

12 otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common
Stock constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.06, shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares
not transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section
2.03. Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without
interest, to the Person in whose name the shares of Parent Common Stock have
been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.06 and the amount of all dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or
payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such shares, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to
surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or
transfer payable with respect to such shares.

Section 2.04 _. Equity Awards._ (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each
then outstanding option to purchase Company Ordinary Shares (each, a "Company
Option"), including options outstanding under the Companys Section 102 Stock
Option Plan, 2003 Israel Share Option Plan, 2006 Israeli Share Incentive
Compensation Plan and Stock Option Plan (Incentive and Restricted Stock
Option) (collectively, the "Company Option Plans"), shall be treated as
follows:

(i) Each Company Option shall be converted into (A) an option to purchase a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (an "Assumed Option") equal to the
product of (x) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be received
with respect to each Company Ordinary Share as Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.02(a) (the "Stock Consideration") _multiplied by_ (y) the number
of Company Ordinary Shares subject to such Company Option, with the aggregate
exercise price for such Assumed Option being equal to a portion of the
aggregate exercise price of the Company Ordinary Shares subject to such
Company Option prior to the conversion equal to the Stock Percentage (as
defined below), plus, if applicable, the Option Shortfall Amount (as defined
below) applicable to such Company Option, and (B) an entitlement to receive an
amount of cash (an "Option Cash Award") equal to the product of (x) the
amount of cash to be received with respect to each Company Ordinary Share as
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02(a) (the "Cash Consideration")
_multiplied by_ (y) the number 



 

13 of Company Ordinary Shares subject to such Company Option, with such product
_reduced by_ an amount equal to a portion of the aggregate exercise price of
the Company Ordinary Shares subject to such Company Option prior to the
conversion equal to the "Cash Percentage" (as defined below); _provided_ ,
that if the amount of an Option Cash Award with respect to a Company Option
pursuant to the above formula is a negative amount, then no Option Cash Award
will be made with respect to such Company Option, and the magnitude of such
negative amount is referred to herein as the "Option Shortfall Amount" with
respect to such Company Option. The "Stock Percentage" shall mean the quotient
of (I) the product of (A) the Stock Consideration multiplied by (B) the
closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ on the trading day
the conclusion of which immediately preceded the Closing Date (the "Closing
Value") divided by (II) the sum of (A) the product set forth in clause (I)
above plus (B) the Cash Consideration. The "Cash Percentage" shall mean the
amount by which one (1) exceeds the Stock Percentage.

(A) Except as provided above, each Assumed Option shall be subject to the same
terms and conditions, including expiration date, vesting (including pursuant
to accelerated vesting as provided under the Company Option Plans) and
exercise provisions, as were applicable to the corresponding Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(B) Each portion of such Option Cash Award resulting from conversion of a
portion of a Company Option that is vested at the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of the Option Cash Award promptly following the Effective Time,
except that with respect to Company Options granted pursuant to Section 102
of the Israel Tax Ordinance, 1961 ("Section 102 Options") and held in trust at
the Effective Time, such amount shall be paid to holder of the Option
Cash Award upon the end of the Section 102 holding period. Each portion of
such Cash Award resulting from conversion of a portion of a Company Option
that is unvested at the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of the
Option Cash Award on or promptly following the applicable vesting date of
such underlying Company Option (including pursuant to accelerated vesting as
provided under the Company Option Plans), except that with respect to Section
102 Options held in trust as of the applicable vesting date, such amount
shall be paid to holder of the Option Cash Award upon the end of the Section
102 holding period.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Israeli Option Tax Ruling
described in Section 8.03(a)(i)(A) is not obtained prior



 

14 to the Closing with respect to all Company Options for which such a ruling is
sought, each Company Option shall be converted into an option (a "Rolled-over
Option") to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of the number of Company
Ordinary Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below). The
per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such Rolled-over Option shall be equal (rounded up to the nearest penny) to
the exercise price per Company Ordinary Share applicable to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange
Ratio. Except as provided above, the Rolled-over Option shall be subject to
the same terms and conditions, including expiration date, vesting (including
pursuant to accelerated vesting as provided under the Company Option Plans)
and exercise provisions, as were applicable to the corresponding Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Section
2.04(a)(ii), the "Option Exchange Ratio" shall be the sum of (i) the Stock
Consideration, and (ii) the amount obtained by dividing (A) the
Cash Consideration, by (B) the Closing Value.

(iii) From and after the Effective Time, each Company Option shall no
longer represent the right to acquire Company Ordinary Shares.

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each unvested restricted Company
Ordinary Share that is subject to a vesting schedule or forfeiture on
termination of employment (a "Company Restricted Share") shall be converted
into the right ("Assumed Restricted Share Awards") to receive (i) the amount
of cash to be received with respect to each Company Ordinary Share as Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02(a) and (ii) the number of shares of
Parent Company Stock to be received with respect to each Company Ordinary
Share as Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02(a), in each case
remaining subject to the vesting schedule in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time to the extent permitted by applicable tax rules.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holder of each Company Option or Assumed Restricted Share
Award appropriate notices setting forth (i) the number of shares of Parent
Company Stock subject to the applicable Assumed Option, Rolled-over Option or
Assumed Restricted Share Awards each as adjusted pursuant to this Section
2.04, and any applicable exercise price, and (ii) the amount of Option Cash
Awards, then held by each such holder. Parent shall take such actions as are
necessary for the assumption of the Option Cash Awards, Assumed Restricted
Share Awards, Assumed Options and Rolled-over Options pursuant to this
Section 2.04, including the reservation, issuance and listing of a sufficient
number of shares of



 

15 Parent Common Stock. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to the Assumed Options, Rolled-over Options and Assumed Restricted
Share Awards promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within
five Business Days after the Effective Time).

(d) With respect to U.S. optionholders, the parties will use reasonable
efforts to accomplish the foregoing in a manner that is in compliance with
the adjustment requirements of Sections 424 and 422 of the Code.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) amend the
Company Option Plans to provide that if, within 12 months after Closing, (A)
an employee is involuntarily terminated by the Company without cause or by
constructive termination or (B) a non-employee director is not a director of
Parent immediately following the Effective Time, all of such individuals
Company Options (including any Assumed Option, Rolled-over Option or Option
Cash Award) and Company Restricted Shares shall become vested, and (ii) use
reasonable efforts to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.04.

Section 2.05. _Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date hereof
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding capital stock of the
Company or Parent shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, reverse stock split, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date prior to
the Effective Time, then in each case, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately and
equitably adjusted.

Section 2.06 _. Fractional Shares._ No fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that a holder of Company Ordinary Shares would otherwise be entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional
share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive,
in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying
the average closing sale price of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ for the period
of five consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the second trading
day prior to the Closing Date by the fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights._ Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Ordinary Shares or
Company Options pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts in cash as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment (in
cash or shares of Parent Common Stock) under any provision of Applicable Law;



 

16 _provided_ that, (i) if the Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling is obtained,
deduction and withholding of any amounts under the Ordinance or any other
provision of Israeli law, if any, shall be made only in accordance with the
provisions of the Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling, and (ii) if any holder of
Company Ordinary Shares provides the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Company with a valid approval or ruling issued by the applicable Governmental
Entity regarding the withholding (or reduction or exemption from withholding)
of Israeli Tax from the Merger Consideration, which in the sole discretion of
Israeli counsel to Parent is sufficient to enable Parent to conclude that no
withholding or a reduced rate of withholding, as applicable, of Israeli Tax is
required, then the deduction and withholding of any amounts under
the Ordinance or any other provision of Israeli law, if any, from the Merger
Consideration payable to such holder shall be made only in accordance with the
provisions of such approval. If the Exchange Agent, Parent or Surviving
Company, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Ordinary Shares or Company Options in respect of which the Exchange
Agent, Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction
and withholding.

Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an appropriate affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Exchange Agent may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Ordinary Shares
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

ARTICLE 3

THE SURVIVING COMPANY

Section 3.01. _The Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association._ The
parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that (i) the Memorandum of
Association of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
Memorandum of Association of the Surviving Company, and (ii) the Articles of
Association of Merger Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Articles of Association of the Surviving Company,
in each case, until amended in accordance with the Companies Law.

Section 3.02. _Directors and Officers._ From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company, and (ii) the officers of
the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Company.

with, and approval by, the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli
Ministry of Trade and Industry ("OCS") of the change in ownership of the Company
to be effected by the Merger (the "OCS Approval"), and (vi) any actions or
filings the absence of which would not be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.04. _Non-contravention._ The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the Memorandum
of Association or the Articles of Association of the Company, (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Sections 4.03 and 5.03,
contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation or breach of any provision
of any Applicable Law applicable to the Company, (iii) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, require any consent or other
action by any Person under, constitute a default under, or cause or permit the

its Subsidiaries is entitled under, any provision of any Company Material
Agreement, or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any material Lien
on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.05. _Capitalization._ (a) The authorized share capital of the

determination letters with respect to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee
Plan of the Company has been maintained in material compliance with its terms
and with the requirements prescribed by any Applicable Law, applicable to such
Employee Plan.

Agreement (alone or together with any other event) will not entitle

Subsidiaries to severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
trigger any payment of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan of the Company. There
is no Employee Plan covering any employee or former employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who is or reasonably could be subject to United
States taxes that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the
payment as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of any
amount that would not be deductible by the Company or such Subsidiary
by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

fiduciary of such Employee Plan). There are no audits, inquiries or
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by any
Governmental Authority with respect to any Employee Plan of the Company.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or (beyond
the minimum benefits and working conditions required by Israeli law
or pursuant to extension orders generally applicable to employees in similar
companies in Israel, which extension orders are listed in Section 4.17(h) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule) subject to, or is currently negotiating in
connection with entering into, any collective bargaining agreement or other

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) the Company and the
Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all laws relating to the
employment of labor, including those related to wages, hours, and withholding
of taxes, with such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (iii)
above, as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has effectuated (x) a
"plant closing" as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining

(30) days prior written notice under the termination notice provisions

to provide statutory severance pay to the Israeli Employees pursuant to the
Severance Pay Law, 1963 are fully funded or accrued on the Companys financial
statements and the Company has not invoked the provisions of Section 14 of the
Severance Pay Law with respect to such statutory severance pay. To Companys
knowledge, there are no circumstances that could give rise to any valid claim
by a current or former Israeli Employee for compensation on termination of
employment (beyond the statutory severance pay to which employees are
entitled). All amounts that the Company is legally or contractually required
either (i) to deduct from the Israeli Employees salaries or to transfer to
the Israeli



 

29 Employees pension or provident, life insurance, incapacity insurance,
continuing education fund or other similar funds or (ii) to withhold from the
Israeli Employees salaries and benefits and to pay to any Governmental
Authority as required by the Ordinance and/or the National Insurance Law, or
otherwise, have, in each case, been duly deducted, transferred, withheld and
paid, and the Company does not have any outstanding obligation to make any
such deduction, transfer, withholding or payment; and (iii) the Company is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable legal requirements
and contracts relating to employment, employment practices, wages, bonuses and
other compensation matters and terms and conditions of employment related to
the Israeli Employees, including but not limited to The Prior Notice to

2002, The Prevention of Sexual Harassment Law, 1998, the Hours of Work and
Rest Law, 1951, the Annual Leave Law, 1951, and The Employment by Human
Resource Contractors Law, 1996. The Company has not engaged any Israeli
Employees whose employment would require special licenses or permits. There
are no unwritten policies or customs that, by extension, could entitle Israeli
Employees to benefits in addition to what they are entitled by law (including
unwritten customs concerning the payment of statutory severance pay when it is
not legally required). The Company has furnished to Parent a correct and
complete summary of the Israeli Employees salaries and material compensation
entitlements. The Company has furnished to Parent (a) copies of all material
agreements with Israeli human resource contractors, or with Israeli
consultants, sub-contractors or freelancers; and (b) copies of material

Subsidiaries as currently conducted ("Environmental Permits"), (ii) all
Environmental Permits are valid and in full force and effect, (iii)

of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Leased Real Property").

(b) With such exceptions as would not reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all leases for material
Company Leased Real Property (the "Company Leases") are in full force and
effect and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the
Companys Knowledge, any other party to any Company Lease, is in material
breach, violation or default under, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice that it has breached, violated or
defaulted under any of the terms or conditions of, any Company Lease. The
Company has made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of each
Company Lease.

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or,
in the case of leased assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of
the material tangible assets used in their respective businesses, free and
clear of any Liens, except Permitted Liens.

Section 4.20. _ Intellectual Property._

(a) To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, the business and
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as they are currently
conducted do not infringe on the Intellectual Property rights of any Third
Party under the laws of any jurisdiction, where such infringement,

proceedings with respect to (i) any alleged infringement by the Company or its
Subsidiaries of any Third Party Intellectual Property, (ii) any alleged unfair
competition or trade practices by the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iii)
any challenge of any Company Owned IP by a Third Party. Except as set forth in
Section 4.20(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received within the three (3) year period prior
to the date hereof any written notice from any Third Party alleging
infringement of such Third Partys Intellectual Property, alleging unfair
competition or trade practices by the Company or its Subsidiaries or
challenging any Company Owned IP.

(b) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person (including, without
limitation, any current or former employee or consultant of the Company or
its Subsidiaries) is infringing, violating or misappropriating any of the
Company Owned IP, or any Intellectual Property which is exclusively licensed
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in a manner resulting in the
waiver or forfeiture of any material rights of the Company under such Company
Owned IP or exclusively licensed Intellectual Property. There are no pending
adversarial proceedings involving the Company with respect to any Company
Owned IP or,



 

31 to the Knowledge of the Company, any Intellectual Property which is
exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except that
any pending applications are the subject of normal examination proceedings by
the USPTO and/or corresponding foreign patent offices. Neither Company nor any
Subsidiary has entered into any agreement granting any Third Party the right
to bring infringement actions with respect to, or otherwise to enforce rights
with respect to, any of the Company Owned IP or any Intellectual Property
which is exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Section 4.20(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list of all agreements granting licenses or similar rights to the
Company or its Subsidiaries under any Third Party Intellectual Property, where
such licenses or similar rights are necessary for the business and operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as they are currently conducted (excluding
generally available licenses for commercial products such as computer
software) ("Necessary IP Licenses"). The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not cause the breach, modification,
cancellation, forfeiture, termination, or suspension of, or acceleration of
any payments with respect to, any Necessary IP Licenses, except as
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Section 4.20(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list of all agreements to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party and pursuant to which any Third Party is authorized to use, exercise
or receive any benefit from Company Owned IP (excluding non-exclusive
licenses granted to customers, distributors, and suppliers of the Companys
products in the ordinary course of business).

(e) Each item of Company Owned IP, including the Intellectual Property
registrations and applications listed in Section 4.20(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and patent applications made available to Parent prior to
the date hereof, (i) is owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries free and
clear of any Liens (other than non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary
course of business) and (ii) is not subject to any outstanding judicial order,
decree, judgment or stipulation or agreement (except as listed in Section
4.20(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) materially restricting the
licensing, assignment, transfer, use or conveyance thereof by Company or the
applicable Subsidiary. None of the registrations and applications listed in
Section 4.20(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule has been adjudged invalid
or enforceable, and there are no pending adversarial proceedings challenging
the validity or enforceability of such registrations or applications,
except that the pending applications included on such schedule are all the
subject of normal examination proceedings by the USPTO and/or corresponding
foreign patent offices.



 

32 (f) The policy of the Company and its Subsidiaries requires each employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries involved in the development of any
Intellectual Property for the Company and its Subsidiaries to sign documents
confirming, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that he or she assigns
to the Company or the applicable Subsidiary all Intellectual Property made,
written, developed or conceived by him or her during the course of his or her
employment by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary and relating to the
business of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary to the extent that
ownership of any such Intellectual Property rights does not vest in the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary by operation of law. To the Knowledge of
the Company, all such assignment documents have been properly executed and
recorded to the extent that failure to do so would result in the waiver or
forfeiture of any material rights of the Company under such Intellectual
Property rights. To the extent any Third Party has been retained to develop or
create Intellectual Property for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
Company or such Subsidiary has obtained either (i) ownership of such
Intellectual Property or (ii) a license thereto sufficient for the current
conduct of its business.

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to protect
and preserve the proprietary nature of each item of Company Owned IP and
to maintain in confidence trade secrets and confidential information
comprising a part thereof, where such steps were considered appropriate and
worthwhile in the reasonable business judgment of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

(h) The Company maintains a comprehensive electronic data protection and back-
up systems to protect, maintain the integrity and prevent the loss
of critical data, information, developments, inventions, source code or other
proprietary or confidential information developed by the Company, in each of
its research and development centers. In addition, the Company has provided to
Parent a copy of a contingency plan for the operations of the Company in
Israel in the event that the security situation in Israel would be adversely
affected by hostilities or acts of terror or destruction.

(i) Except as set forth in Section 4.20(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a member of or party to any patent
pool, industry standards body, trade association or other organization
pursuant to the rules of which it is obligated to license any existing or
future Intellectual Property to any Person; none of the Company Owned IP is
required to be licensed under any agreement with such organizations; and none
of the Company Owned IP has been submitted to any licensing entity, standards
body or representative thereof for a determination of essentiality to or
inclusion in an industry standard, nor has any request been made therefor by
a Third Party. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its
Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all rules and regulations of any
organization identified in Section 4.20(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.



 

33 (j) Neither Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any non-competition or
other similar restrictive agreement or arrangement relating to any business
or service anywhere in the world.

(k) No open source software forms part of any Company Owned IP which the
Company, in its reasonable business judgment, regards as having a material
proprietary value to the Company and no such Company Owned IP is a derivative
work of any open source software.

Section 4.21. _Material Contracts._ (a) Except for this Agreement, as of the
date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by (any contract of the type described in this Section 4.21(a) being
referred to herein as a "Company Material Contract"):

(i) any outbound lease, license, sale or other similar agreement providing for
the sale, lease or license by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of

of $350,000 or more, or (B) aggregate payments to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of $1,000,000 or more over the next five (5) years, except for
any such contract between the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries;

purchase, lease or license by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
goods, services, Intellectual Property or other assets that is expected to
result in either (A) annual payments by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of $350,000 or more, or (B) aggregate payments by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of $1,000,000 or more over the next five (5) years, except for
any such contract between the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries;

(iii) any contract or agreement evidencing (A) outstanding indebtedness for
borrowed money, or (B) an obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to guarantee, or otherwise indemnify or hold harmless any Person,
in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money, in the case of each of clauses
(A) and (B), in or for an amount of $350,000 or more, except for any
such contract or agreement between the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries;

(iv) any joint venture, partnership, strategic alliance, or similar
agreement;



 

34 (v) any contract or agreement relating to the acquisition or disposition of
any material business or any interest therein under which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has any material outstanding rights or obligations;

(vi) any contract or agreement that limits, or purports to limit, in any
material respect, the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
compete in a line of business or with any Person or in any geographic area or
during any period of time;

(vii) any contract or agreement that, upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will result in any of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
granting any rights or licenses to any material Intellectual Property of any
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to any Third Party; and

(viii) any other "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, other than Item 601(b)(10)(iii)).

(b) (i) Each Company Material Contract is in full force and effect, (ii) no
written or, to the Knowledge of the Company, other claim of default under or
cancellation of any Company Material Contract has been received by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, in any material respect, in breach or violation of, or
default under, any Company Material Contract, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no other party is, in any material respect, in breach or violation
of, or default under, any Company Material Contract. As of the date hereof,
the Company has heretofore delivered or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of all Company Material Contracts. 

Section 4.22. _Insurance._ The Company or one of its Subsidiaries maintains
insurance coverage with reputable insurers in such amounts and covering such
reasonably insurable risks as are in accordance with normal industry practice
for companies engaged in businesses similar to that of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taking into account the cost and availability of
such insurance). With respect to each insurance policy that is material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach or default (including any such
breach or default with respect to the payment of premiums or the giving of
notice), and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred which,
with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default,
or permit termination or modification, under the policy.



 

35 Section 4.23. _Antitakeover Laws._ To the Knowledge of the Company, no "fair
price," "control share acquisition," "moratorium" or other antitakeover laws,

rights plan or "poison pill."

Section 4.24 _. Insider Interests._ To the Knowledge of the Company, no
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any material
interest in any material property, real or personal, tangible or intangible,
including inventions, patents, trademarks or trade names, used in or
pertaining to the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.25 _. Privacy and Data Security._ The Company has provided true and
correct copies of all current privacy policies adopted by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with their operations. Except as would not result
in a material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has (i) complied with all any Applicable Law
related to the protection, privacy and security of sensitive personal

Section 6.02. _Court Approval; Company Meetings._ (a) As promptly as
practicable after the date hereof and in accordance with Sections 350 and 351
of the Companies Law, the Company shall submit to the district court of
Tel AvivJaffa (the "Israeli Court") a first motion to convene, in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Companies Law and the Articles of
Association of the Company, and as shall be ordered by the Israeli Court,
a meeting of the shareholders of the Company (the "Company Shareholder
Meeting") and (if applicable) a meeting of the Companys creditors (the
"Company Creditor Meeting") for the approval by the affirmative vote of a
majority in number representing at least 75% of the votes cast (not including
abstainees) in each of the Company Shareholder Meeting, and (if applicable)
the Company Creditor Meeting (together (if applicable), the "Section
350 Vote") of the terms and conditions of an arrangement between the Company
and its shareholders and/or (if applicable) creditors in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (the "Merger Proposal"). In such motion the Company
will inform the Israeli Court that upon the approval of the Merger Proposal by
the Section 350 Vote, and subsequently by the Israeli Court, such court
approval would be relied upon by Parent for the purpose of qualifying the
issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Article 2 for the exemption from
the registration requirements of the 1933 Act under Section 3(a)(10) thereof.
Subject to Section 6.03(b), the Board of Directors of the Company shall make
and not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Board
Recommendation.

(b) In connection with the Company Shareholder Meeting and (if
applicable) the Company Creditor Meeting, the Company shall (i) mail to each
of



 

45 its shareholders and (if applicable) creditors a notice of the respective
meetings, the order of the court to convene such meetings, the application
for the approval of the proposed Merger Proposal submitted to the court, a
power of attorney to attend such meetings in accordance with the Companies Law
and a proxy card for the vote (the "Company Proxy Statement"), (ii) subject
to Section 6.03(b), use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Section 350 Vote, and (iii) otherwise comply with the legal requirements
applicable to such meeting.

(c) Following the approval of the Merger Proposal by the shareholders and (if
applicable) the creditors of the Company as set forth above, the Company will
submit to the Israeli Court a second motion (i) to approve the arrangement and
the Merger Proposal and order the parties to take all actions to be taken in
accordance with the Merger Proposal; and (ii) to hold a hearing regardless
of whether or not any objections to the Merger Proposal are raised (such
approval of the arrangement and the Merger Proposal by the Israeli Court when
obtained, the "Court Approval").

Section 6.03. _No Solicitation; Other Offers._ (a) From the date hereof until
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to its terms, subject to Section 6.03(b), neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
authorize or knowingly permit any of its Representatives to, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage, directly or indirectly, the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Third Party any nonpublic information or data
with respect to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate the making
of, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to make, or withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Board Recommendation (or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal) (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an "Adverse
Recommendation Change") (it being understood, however, that for all purposes
of this Agreement, the fact that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Representatives has taken any of the actions described in clause (ii)
above as permitted by this Agreement shall not be deemed in and of itself a
withdrawal or modification of the Board Recommendation or a recommendation of
any Acquisition Proposal), or (iv) enter into any agreement with respect to
any Acquisition Transaction, except for a confidentiality agreement as
contemplated by Section 6.03(b)(ii). The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions and negotiations, if any, with any Third
Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company,
directly or indirectly through any Representatives of the Company, may (i)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that has made a
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, which has not been solicited, initiated or



 

46 knowingly encouraged by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives that the Board of Directors (or any Special
Committee of the Board of Directors) has determined, in its good faith
judgment after receiving the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel and
a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation, is or would
reasonably be likely to result in a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish
to such Third Party nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms and
conditions in all material respects no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, (iii) following receipt of
any such Acquisition Proposal that is so determined to be a Superior Proposal,
make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (iv) take any non-appealable,
final action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to
take, but (x) in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iii), only if the Board of Directors of the Company (or a Special Committee)
determines in good faith, after considering advice from the Companys outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be likely
to constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law, and (y) in the case referred to in clause (iii), only if the Company
shall have complied with the requirements set forth in the second proviso to
Section 10.01(d)(i). Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of
Directors of the Company (or a Special Committee) from complying with Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is
consistent with this Section 6.03.

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event no later than
24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request by any Third Party for any nonpublic
information in connection with, or which the Company reasonably concludes
could lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in connection with such
notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including material amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or request.

Section 6.04 _. Affiliates._ Prior to the date of the Company Shareholder
Meeting, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all known
Persons who, in the opinion of the Company, as of the time of the Company
Shareholder Meeting, may be deemed affiliates of the Company under Rule 145
of the 1933 Act and who did not sign an Affiliate Agreement concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement (an "Unsigned Company Rule 145 Affiliate").
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a signed
Affiliate Agreement from each Unsigned Company Rule 145 Affiliate as soon as
practicable and, in any event prior to the Closing Date.



 

47 Section 6.05 _. Termination of 401(k) Plan._ The Company will adopt, or will
cause to be adopted, all necessary corporate resolutions to terminate any
Employee Plan of the Company that is a 401(k) Plan, effective as of no later
than one day prior to Closing (but such termination may be contingent upon the
Closing). Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will make (or
cause to be made) all necessary payments to fund the contributions: (i)
necessary or required to maintain the tax-qualified status of any such 401(k)
Plan; (ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant to any such 401(k) Plan for
the period prior to termination; and (iii) for employer matching contributions
(if any) for the period prior to termination. A "401(k) Plan" means any plan
sponsored and maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code which includes a
cash or deferred arrangement intended to be qualified under Section 401(k) of
the Code. The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of resolutions duly
adopted by the board of directors of the Company (or applicable ERISA
Affiliate) terminating any such 401(k) Plan.

Parent agrees that:

Section 7.01 _. Conduct of Parent._ Except as (i) is expressly contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) may be required by Applicable Law, or (iii) may be
agreed in advance in writing with the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed), from the date hereof until the Effective Time:

(a) Parent shall not amend its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or
comparable organizational documents to the extent any such amendment would
adversely affect the rights of the Parent Common Stock;

(b) Parent shall not (i) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other

(c) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, merge
or consolidate with, or acquire a substantial portion of the assets of, any
business or any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other
business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any assets, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or significantly increase the
risk of not obtaining, any Governmental Authorizations necessary to consummate
the



 

48 transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting period, or (ii) significantly increase the risk of
any Governmental Authority entering an order or other Applicable Law
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

any action that would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of Section

or commit to do any of the foregoing. 

Section 7.02. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary._ Parent shall cause Merger

the consummation of the Merger, in accordance with the terms and conditions

320(c) of the Companies Law in connection with Parent, shall cast any votes in
respect of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Parent shall, prior to such vote, disclose to the Company
the respective interests of Parent or such Person in such shares so voted.

Section 7.04. _Agreement to Defend and Indemnify._ Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving Company hereby agrees to,
do the following:

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under
Applicable Law the present and former directors and officers of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel), judgments,
fines, losses, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any acts or omissions by any such Indemnified Person in their
capacity as an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "Indemnified
Claims") and (ii) advance reasonable expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law in connection with any Indemnified Claims,
in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above to the same extent such
Indemnified Persons are entitled to be indemnified, held harmless or have the
right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant



 

49 to Applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents and indemnification
agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if any, in existence on the
date hereof with any Indemnified Persons disclosed on Section 7.04 of the

and officers liability insurance with an insurer with a Standard and Poors

equivalent rating from AM Best), a "tail policy", in each case, in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each
Indemnified Person currently covered by the Companys officers and
directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof (which policy has been provided by the Company to Parent) (with
carriers at least substantially comparable in claims paying rating to the
Companys existing carriers); _provided_ that, in satisfying its obligation
under this Section 7.04(b), Parent shall not be obligated to pay an aggregate
annual premium in excess of an amount equal to 250% of the amount per annum
the Company paid in its last full fiscal year (the "Maximum Annual Premium");
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if the aggregate annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium.

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then the obligations of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, that are set forth under this Section
7.04 shall survive, and to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.
Parent shall be responsible for any breach by the Surviving Company of the
provisions of this Section 7.04.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in
addition to any rights to indemnification and exculpation that such Person
may have under any Applicable Law. These rights shall survive consummation of
the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person and their respective successors, assigns, heirs or
personal representatives, and such persons shall be entitled to reimbursement
by the Surviving Company or Parent of fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred to enforce successfully the terms of this Section
7.04. 



 

50 Section 7.05. _Employee Matters._ For purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits under the Employee Plans providing benefits
to participants in the Employee Plans of the Company (including all eligible
dependents) who continue as employees of Parent, the Company or any other
Subsidiary of Parent after the Effective Time (the "Company Participants"),
each Company Participant shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
receive credit for his or her years of service with the Company (and its
Subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Company Participant was entitled, prior to the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any similar Employee Plan in which such
Company Participant participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, that such credit shall not
result in duplication of benefits and such credit shall not apply with respect
to any "years of service" or similar calculations for benefits to be paid
under defined benefit pension plans. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, for purposes of each Employee Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Participant after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause any and all pre-
existing condition exclusions, actively-at-work or similar limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements of such
Employee Plan to be waived with respect to such Company Participant, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Participant participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall provide such
Company Participant with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets
(or similar payments) made during the portion of the plan year that includes
the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible,
coinsurance, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any Employee Plans
in which they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time. Nothing in
this Section 7.05 (a) will be or be deemed to be an amendment of any Employee
Plan of the Company or (b) will require Parent to continue the service
relationship (whether as an employee, director, consultant, or otherwise) of
any individual.

Section 7.06 _. Registration Statement._ If, prior to the Closing, Parent
receives notice or communication of any Claim by the SEC with respect to the
issuance of Parent securities pursuant to the terms hereof without
registration under the 1933 Act by virtue of Section 3(a)(10) thereof, Parent
shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC under the 1933 Act a registration
statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement") and shall use all
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Parent shall promptly take
any action required to be taken under foreign or state securities or Blue Sky
laws in connection with the issuance of Parent securities pursuant to the
terms hereof.

efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection



 

51 with the Merger to be approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official
notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and in
any event prior to the Closing Date.

Section 7.08 _. Section 16 Matters. _Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall take all required actions to cause any acquisitions of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article 2 by each individual
who may become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
1934 Act with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the 1934 Act.

ARTICLE 8

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

The parties hereto agree that:

Section 8.01. _Reasonable Best Efforts._ (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use, and cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use, their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental Authority all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent
and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Investment Center Approval and the OCS Approval. In this connection,
Parent shall provide to the Investment Center and to the OCS any information
and shall execute the standard form of undertakings required by the OCS as a
condition to the OCS Approval.

cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act and Foreign Antitrust Laws as expeditiously as practicable.

(iii) If any Claim is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by or before
any Governmental Authority challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or if any Applicable Law is enacted, entered, promulgated or
enforced by a Governmental Authority that would make the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prohibit
or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the Company will
cooperate in all respects with each other to (A) contest any such Claim, (B)
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment, injunction, stay
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (C) have any such Applicable Law repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable
so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(iv) Parent will, if reasonably necessary to obtain the consent,
authorization, order, approval or exemption of any Governmental Authority

Subsidiaries (or of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) or conduct its
business in a specified manner (or agree to do any of the foregoing or permit
any of the foregoing), and the Company will cooperate with Parent in this
regard; _provided_ that, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to require
the parties to this Agreement to agree to or effect any divestiture or take
any other action (A) that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger, or (B) if doing so, after giving effect to any reasonably expected net
after-tax proceeds of any divestiture or sale, would reasonably be expected
to (1) have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, or (2) diminish materially the benefits expected to be received by
Parent from the Merger as of the date hereof.

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with one another in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required. Each of Parent or the Company shall use



 

53 reasonable best efforts to take or obtain any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers that are required to be taken or obtained from parties to their
respective contracts in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to Applicable Law and the terms of any
relevant agreements with Third Parties relating to the exchange of
information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance,

apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications sent to or received by Parent or the Company

Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each party hereto shall afford the other party (or parties) with advance
notice of, and a meaningful opportunity to participate in, any such
communications to or from any Governmental Authority, including, without
limitation, a right to attend, with advisors present, any meetings
(telephonic or in person) with such Governmental Authority.

Section 8.02 _. Israeli Approvals._ In furtherance and not in limitation of
Section 8.01:

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent
and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain

Parent shall provide to the Investment Center and to the OCS any
information and shall execute any undertakings customarily requested by such
authorities as a condition to the Investment Center Approval and the OCS
Approval.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall cause their respective Israeli
counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all activities, and to
cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of all
documents filed with respect to the Court Approval. In addition, each of the
Company and Parent shall at all times comply with all the procedures detailed
in the Companies Law and shall make all necessary actions in order to minimize
the term of such procedures. 

Section 8.03 _. Tax Matters._ (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, the Company and Parent shall cause their respective Israeli
counsel and accountants to prepare and file with the Israeli Income Tax
Commissioner applications for two rulings:

(i) (A) one ruling that confirms that treatment of Company Ordinary Shares and
Company Options under Section 2.04(a)(i) or Section



 

54 2.04(b), in respect of Company Ordinary Shares and Company Options held in
trust at the Effective Time under a "Section 102 Plan" will not result in an
immediate taxable event for the person entitled to such Company Ordinary
Shares or Company Options and will not affect the length of the holding period
required with respect to such Company Ordinary Shares or Company Options,
which ruling may be subject to such terms regularly associated with such
rulings, and (B) in the event the ruling described in clause (A) above does
not apply to all Company Ordinary Shares and Company Options held in trust
under a "Section 102 Plan", an additional ruling that confirms that treatment
of Company Ordinary Shares and Company Options under Section 2.04(a)(ii) or
Section 2.04(b), in respect of Company Ordinary Shares and Company Options
held in trust at the Effective Time under a "Section 102 Plan" will not result
in an immediate taxable event for the person entitled to such Company Ordinary
Shares or Company Options and will not affect the length of the holding
period required with respect to such Company Ordinary Shares or Company
Options, which ruling may be subject to such terms regularly associated with
such rulings (the rulings referred to in clauses (A) and (B) above, the
"Israeli Option Tax Rulings"); and

(ii) a second ruling (the "Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling") that either (i)
exempts Parent, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Company from any
obligation to withhold Israeli Tax at source from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement as part of the Merger
Consideration or in respect of Company Options pursuant to Section 2.04, or
clarifying that no such obligation exists, or (ii) clearly instructs Parent,
the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Company how such withholding at source is
to be executed, and in particular, with respect to the classes or categories
of holders or former holders of Company Ordinary Shares or Company Options
from which Tax is to be withheld (if any), the rate or rates of withholding to
be applied. 

(b) The Company and Parent agree that Parent and its Affiliates will treat the
Merger as a taxable purchase of stock of the Company for all Tax purposes.

Section 8.04. _Public Announcements._ Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release, making any other public
statement, or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any
listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or
association, shall not issue any such press release, make any such other
public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference call
without the other partys consent.



 

55 Section 8.05. _Notices of Certain Events._ The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other party of:

in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) any Claim commenced or threatened in writing against, relating to

representations, warranties and agreements contained herein and in any
certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the
Effective Time; _provided_ that, this Section 11.02 shall not limit

privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies

within 12 months following the date of such termination, either an Acquisition
Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a binding definitive

Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated). For purposes of the
definition of Payment Event, the term "Acquisition Transaction" shall have the
meaning ascribed to such term in Section 1.01, except that references
to "15%" therein shall be deemed to read "50%." The Company shall pay to
Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds (x)
prior to or concurrently with the Payment Event in the case of the
Payment Events described in clauses (i)(B) and (ii) of the definition of
Payment Event and (y) within two Business Days following any other Payment
Event. The parties hereto agree that in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the amount referred to in this Section 11.04(b) on more than one
occasion.

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreement contained in this Section
11.04 is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without this agreement, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.

Parent pursuant to Section 11.04(b), it shall also pay any costs and expenses
incurred by Parent (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any
action, including the prosecution of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken

at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in New York City from
the date such fee was required to be paid to the date it is paid.



 

63 Section 11.05. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._ (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.04,
shall inure only to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.04, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other
party hereto.

construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state, except to the extent that certain
matters are preempted by the federal securities laws or are governed by the
law of the jurisdiction of organization of the respective parties hereto.

Section 11.07. _Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or any Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any suit, action or proceeding described in the preceding
paragraph may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any court identified in the preceding paragraph.

such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.



 

64 Section 11.09. _Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication).

Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 11.11. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to give effect to the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.12. _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly, that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof.

Section 11.13 _. Disclosure Schedule References._ The parties hereto agree
that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure
for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants,
as applicable) of the Company that are contained in the corresponding Section
of this Agreement, and (ii) any other representations and warranties of the
Company that are contained herein, but only if the relevance of that reference
as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other
representations and warranties is reasonably apparent. The parties hereto
agree that any matter referred to or described in any Company SEC Document or
Parent SEC Document, as the case 



 

65 may be, shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) any representation or warranty of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, that are contained herein, if the relevance of
that reference or description as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes
of) such representation or warranty is reasonably apparent.
