should be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining



whether there has been a Parent Material Adverse Effect); provided that, in
the case of clauses (a), (b), (c), (e) and (h) the adverse impact on the

ARTICLE II

MERGER

Section 2.1 Closing of the Merger.

(a) Closing Date. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
(other than those conditions that are not legally permitted to be waived) to
closing set forth in Article VI, the closing (the "Closing") of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Section 2.1 shall be held at the
offices of Baker Botts L.L.P., 910 Louisiana Street, Houston, Texas 77002 on
the next Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (other than those
conditions that are not legally permitted to be waived) of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than conditions that would normally
be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to satisfaction or waiver (other
than those conditions that are not legally permitted to be waived) of those
conditions) commencing at 9:00 a.m., local time, or such other place, date and
time as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto. The
"Closing Date," as referred to herein, shall mean the date on which the
Closing actually occurs.

(b) Effective Time. Concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the
Closing, Parent and MLP shall cause a certificate of merger effecting the
Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, duly executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA, as applicable (the date and time of such
filing (or, if agreed by the parties hereto, such later time and date as may
be expressed therein as the effective date and time of the Merger) being the
"Effective Time"). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into MLP,
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and MLP shall continue as
the surviving limited partnership in the Merger (the "Surviving Entity").

(c) Effect of the Merger on Equity Securities. Subject in each case to Section
2.1(d) and (e), at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, MLP, MLP General Partner, any Holder
of MLP Common Units, any Holder of Parent Common Stock, or any other Person:

(i) Conversion of MLP Public Units. Each of the MLP Public Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive 0.4900 shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent
Common Stock (such number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the "Merger
Consideration").

(ii) Rights of Holders of MLP Public Units. Each MLP Public Unit, upon being
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Section 2.1(c), shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each Holder of such MLP Public Units
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter cease to be a limited
partner of MLP or have any rights with respect to such



MLP Public Units, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
distributions to which former Holders of MLP Public Units become entitled all
in accordance with this Article II upon the Surrender of (A) a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented MLP Public Units (an
"MLP Certificate") or (B) uncertificated MLP Public Units represented by book-
entry ("Book-Entry MLP Common Units"), together with such properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents in accordance
with Section 2.2.

(iii) Treatment of MLP-Owned Common Units and Parent-Owned Partnership
Interests. Any MLP Common Units that are owned immediately prior to the
Effective Time by MLP shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such canceled MLP
Common Units. The MLP General Partner Interest and all MLP Common Units that
are not MLP Public Units or not canceled pursuant to the first sentence of
this clause (iii) shall, in each case, remain outstanding as partnership
interests in the Surviving Entity, unaffected by the Merger.

(iv) Equity of Merger Sub. The outstanding limited liability company interest
in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into an aggregate number of common units representing
limited partner interests in the Surviving Entity equal to the number of MLP
Public Units that are converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i). At the Effective Time, the books
and records of MLP shall be revised to reflect the cancellation and retirement
of all MLP Public Units and the conversion of the limited liability company
interest in Merger Sub to common units of the Surviving Entity, and the
existence of MLP (as the Surviving Entity) shall continue without dissolution.

(d) Other Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall be conducted in accordance
with and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA. At the Effective Time, (i) the certificate of
limited partnership of MLP shall continue as the certificate of limited
partnership of the Surviving Entity, and (ii) the MLP Partnership Agreement
shall remain unchanged and shall continue as the agreement of limited
partnership of the Surviving Entity, until duly amended in accordance with
applicable Law and the terms of the MLP Partnership Agreement.

(e) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that a Holder of MLP Common Units would otherwise be entitled to receive
as Merger Consideration (after taking into account all MLP Common Units held
by such Holder) will be aggregated and then, if a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock results from that aggregation, be rounded up to the nearest whole
share of Parent Common Stock (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no Person that
is not a record holder of MLP Common Units or a DTC Participant will be
entitled hereunder to have any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
rounded up, and none of Parent, AAI or the Surviving Entity shall have any
obligation pursuant to this sentence with respect to any Person that is not a
record holder of MLP



Common Units or a DTC Participant) and any such additional Parent Common Stock
shall become part of the Merger Consideration.

(f) Certain Adjustments. If between the Execution Date and the Effective Time,
whether or not permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the number
of outstanding MLP Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
increased, decreased or changed into a different number of units, shares or
other securities (including any different class or series of securities) by
reason of any dividend or distribution payable in, or an issuance of,
partnership interests, voting securities, equity interests or Rights, or by
reason of any subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up, combination,
merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other similar transaction,
or any such transaction shall be authorized, declared or agreed upon with a
record date at or prior to the Effective Time, then the Merger Consideration,
and any other similarly dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of such transaction and to provide to Parent, MLP,
Merger Sub and the Holders of MLP Restricted Unit Awards and MLP Public Units
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event, and thereafter, all references in this Agreement to the Merger
Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be references to
the Merger Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items, as so
adjusted; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.1(f) shall be
deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such dividend or
distribution payable in equity securities or Rights, subdivision,
reclassification, split, split-up, combination, merger, consolidation,
reorganization, exchange or other similar transaction, or the authorization,
declaration or agreement to do such transaction that it is not otherwise
authorized or permitted to be undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.2 Exchange of MLP Public Units.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the mailing of the Consent Statement/Prospectus,
Parent shall appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC to act as
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section
2.2(c). At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i) reserve with the Exchange
Agent the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section
2.1(c)(i), and (ii) authorize the Exchange Agent to exchange shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.2. Parent shall, from time to
time, deposit with the Exchange Agent any additional cash or other
consideration as and when necessary to pay any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) (and shall authorize the Exchange
Agent to pay out the same). Such Parent Common Stock and any cash or other
consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred
to as the "Exchange Fund." Parent shall pay all costs and fees of the Exchange
Agent and all expenses associated with the exchange process. Any shares of
Parent Common Stock and any other funds deposited with the Exchange Agent
shall be returned to Parent after the earlier to occur of (x) payment in full
of all amounts due to the Holders of MLP Public Units under this Article II
and (y) the expiration of the period specified in Section 2.2(e).

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to each Holder, as of the Effective
Time, of MLP Public Units whose MLP Public Units were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration a form of letter of transmittal (the
"Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the MLP Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the MLP Certificates (or lost certificate affidavit as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b)) to the



Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry MLP Common Units, upon adherence
to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be
in customary form and have such other reasonable provisions as Parent and MLP
may agree prior to the Effective Time) and instructions for effecting the
Surrender of such MLP Certificates (or lost certificate affidavit as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b)) or Book-Entry MLP Common Units in
exchange for, as applicable, whole shares of Parent Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Subject to
Section 2.2(c), upon Surrender to the Exchange Agent of such MLP Certificates
(or lost certificate affidavit as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b)) or
Book-Entry MLP Common Units, together with such properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the Holder of an MLP Certificate (or lost
certificate affidavit as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b)) or Book-Entry
MLP Common Units shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested) to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i) and
(ii) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) to
which such Holder is entitled. The instructions for effecting the Surrender of
MLP Certificates shall set forth procedures that must be taken by the Holder
of any MLP Certificate that has been lost, destroyed or stolen; it shall be a
condition to the right of such Holder to receive the Merger Consideration and
any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) that the Exchange Agent
shall have received, along with the Letter of Transmittal, a duly executed
lost certificate affidavit, including an agreement to indemnify Parent for
losses suffered by Parent because of such lost certificate, in customary form,
signed exactly as the name or names of the registered Holder or Holders of MLP
Public Units appeared on the books of MLP immediately prior to the Effective
Time, together with a customary bond and such other documents, in each case,
as Parent may reasonably require in connection therewith. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of MLP or its transfer
agent of MLP Certificates or Book-Entry MLP Common Units (provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not restrict the transfer of any MLP Partnership
Interest other than the MLP Public Units after the Effective Time); and if
such MLP Certificates or Book-Entry MLP Common Units are presented to MLP or
its transfer agent for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of
the appropriate Merger Consideration and any dividends and other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) as hereinabove provided. Until Surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each MLP Certificate or Book-Entry MLP
Common Unit in respect of MLP Public Units shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such Surrender
the appropriate Merger Consideration, together with any dividends and other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or (d). No interest will be
paid or will accrue on any dividends and other distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.2(c) or (d).

(c) Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged MLP Public Units.
No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in the Merger with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Holder of any MLP Certificate or Book-Entry MLP Common Units
not Surrendered with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
respect thereof until the Surrender of such MLP Certificate or Book-Entry MLP
Common Units in accordance with this Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws, Parent shall pay, or cause the Exchange Agent to pay, to the
Holder of each MLP Certificate or Book-Entry MLP Common Units, without
interest, (i) at the time of Surrender of such



MLP Certificate or Book-Entry MLP Common Units, the amount of dividends or
other distributions previously paid with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable with respect to such MLP Certificate or Book-Entry MLP
Common Units that have a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the time of Surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends and distributions payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time and prior to such Surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
Surrender.

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in MLP Public Units. All Merger Consideration
issued upon the Surrender for exchange of MLP Certificates or Book-Entry MLP
Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the MLP Public Units heretofore represented by such MLP Certificates or
Book-Entry MLP Common Units (including all rights to common units arrearages),
subject, however, to Parent's obligation, with respect to MLP Public Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, to pay any distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or
made by MLP on such MLP Public Units in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and that remain unpaid at the
Closing Date.

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the Holders of the MLP Certificates or Book-Entry MLP
Common Units for 18 months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any Holders of the MLP Certificates or Book-Entry MLP
Common Units who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.2 shall
thereafter look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration and any distributions with
respect to MLP Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
Holders may be entitled.

(f) No Liability. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, MLP, MLP General Partner or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration or distribution properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any MLP Certificates or Book-Entry MLP Common Units
shall not have been Surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any
Merger Consideration or any distributions with respect to MLP Common Units or
shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of such MLP Certificate or Book-Entry
MLP Common Units would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any such units or distributions in respect of such MLP Certificates or
Book-Entry MLP Common Units shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) Withholding Rights. Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, without duplication, such amounts, which may
include shares of Parent Common Stock, as Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent reasonably deems to be required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so



withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(h) No Dissenters' Rights. No dissenters' or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 2.3 Treatment of MLP Restricted Unit Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, each MLP Restricted Unit Award that is not vested
and does not vest in accordance with its terms (as set forth in an applicable
award agreement) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become fully vested and shall be converted into the right to
receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of MLP
Common Units subject to each such MLP Restricted Unit Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration (rounded up to
the next whole share) as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, along
with any corresponding accrued but unpaid DERs (as defined in the MLP Long-
Term Incentive Plan) with respect to any MLP Restricted Unit Awards.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, MLP and MLP General Partner shall take all
action necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3. MLP and MLP
General Partner shall ensure that, as of immediately following the Effective
Time, no holder of an MLP Restricted Unit Award or participant in the MLP
Long-Term Incentive Plan shall have any rights thereunder to acquire, or other
rights in respect of, the equity of MLP, the Surviving Entity or any of the
MLP Subsidiaries.

Section 3.5 SEC Documents; Internal Controls.

(a) Since January 1, 2015, all reports, including but not limited to the
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the
Current Reports on Form 8-K (whether filed on a voluntary basis or otherwise),
forms, schedules, certifications, prospectuses, registration statements and
other documents required to be filed or furnished by MLP or any MLP Subsidiary
with or to the SEC have been or will be timely filed or furnished (the "MLP
SEC Reports"). Each of the MLP SEC Reports (i) complied in all material
respects with the requirements of applicable Law (including the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act")), and
(ii) as of its effective date (in the case of MLP SEC Reports that are
registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities
Act) and as of its filing date did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except for any
statements (x) in any MLP SEC Report that may have been modified by an
amendment to such report or a subsequent report filed with the SEC prior to
the Execution Date or (y) with respect to information supplied in writing by
or on behalf of Parent, as to which MLP makes no representation or warranty.

(b) No MLP Subsidiary is required to file reports, forms or other documents
with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding comments
from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with respect to the
MLP SEC Reports. No enforcement action has been initiated against MLP relating
to disclosures contained or omitted from any MLP SEC Report.

(c) MLP makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised and
maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, as required pursuant to
Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange Act. MLP has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act and the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by MLP in the reports that it files under
the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to its management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(d) Since January 1, 2015, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the MLP General Partner have made all certifications
(without qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to
Knowledge) required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in
any such certifications are complete and correct in all material respects, and
none of such entities or its officers have received notice from any
Governmental Entity



questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of
filing or submission of such certification. As of the Execution Date, and
except as disclosed in an MLP SEC Report filed with the SEC prior to the
Execution Date, none of such entities has any Knowledge of any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal controls over financial
reporting.

complete copy of the consolidated unaudited statements of operations,
partners' equity and cash flows for the six month period ended June 30, 2017
and balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 for MLP (the referenced financial
statements set forth in such Form 10-K and Form 10-Q of MLP are collectively
referred to as the "MLP Financial Statements"). The MLP Financial Statements
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto) and present fairly in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of MLP as of such dates and the consolidated results of

therein and subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to
normal and recurring adjustments and the absence of certain notes that are

business since December 31, 2016, (iii) liabilities and obligations incurred
under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the

forms, schedules, certifications, prospectuses, registration statements and
other documents required to be filed or furnished by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary with or to the SEC have been or will be timely filed or furnished
(the "Parent SEC Reports"). Each of the Parent SEC Reports (i) complied in all
material respects with the requirements of applicable Law (including the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and (ii) as of
its effective date (in the case of Parent SEC Reports that are registration
statements filed pursuant to the Securities Act) and as of its filing date did

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

that may have been modified by an amendment to such report or a subsequent
report filed with the SEC prior to the Execution Date or (y) with respect to

makes no representation or warranty.

such material information is accumulated and communicated to its management as

certifications are complete and correct in all material respects, and none of
such entities or its officers have received notice from any Governmental
Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner
of filing or submission of such certification. As of the Execution Date, and

materially hinder, impede or delay the ability of the



parties to satisfy any of the conditions to or the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) From the Execution Date until the Closing Date, neither MLP nor Parent
shall, nor shall it cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any

party of any covenant, obligation, or agreement contained in this Agreement;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section

Laws, upon reasonable notice, each Party Group shall (and shall cause the
members of such Party Group to) afford the officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other representatives and advisors of the requesting Party
Group reasonable access, during normal business hours from the Execution Date
until the Closing Date, to its properties, books, contracts and records as
well as to their management personnel; provided that such access shall be
provided on a basis that minimizes the disruption to the operations of the
disclosing Party Group and the members of its Party Group. The disclosing
Party Group shall not be responsible to the requesting Party Group for
personal injuries sustained by the requesting Party Group's officers,

applicable Laws, during such period, each Party Group shall (and shall cause
the members of such Party Group to) furnish promptly to the other Party Group
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed, published, announced or received by it in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement during such period pursuant to the
requirements of Federal, state or foreign Laws (including pursuant to the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules of any Governmental Entity
thereunder), as applicable (other than documents which such Party Group is not
permitted to disclose under applicable Laws) and (ii) all information
concerning the disclosing Party Group's business, properties and personnel as
the requesting Party Group may reasonably request, including all information
relating to environmental matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party
Group shall have no obligation to disclose or provide access to any

jeopardize any privilege available to such Party Group relating to such
information or would be in violation of a confidentiality obligation binding
on such Party Group. Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 19, 2017 between Parent and
MLP (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
each



party shall hold information received from the other party pursuant to this
Section 5.2 in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Section 5.3 Certain Filings.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Execution Date (i) each of the

Registration Statement (including the joint consent statement/prospectus
constituting a part thereof (the "Consent Statement/Prospectus")), (ii) Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE
(subject, if applicable, to notice of issuance) prior to the Effective Time,
and (iii) the parties hereto shall make all required filings under applicable
state securities and "blue sky" Laws; provided, however, that no such filings
shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, Parent would
become subject to general service of process or to taxation or qualification
to do business as a foreign corporation doing business in such jurisdiction
solely as a result of such filing. Parent shall file the Registration
Statement with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of Parent
and MLP shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after filing thereof and keep the Registration
Statement effective until the earlier of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. Each of Parent and MLP shall furnish to the other
party all information concerning the Parent Group Entities or the MLP Group
Entities, as applicable, and to take such other action as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the foregoing. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Consent Statement/Prospectus
will be made by Parent or MLP, in each case without providing the other party
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

(b) Each of the Parent Parties and the MLP Parties agrees, as to itself and
its Subsidiaries, that (i) none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or
supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and (ii) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by
it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Consent
Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date
the Consent Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the Holders of MLP Common Units,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Parent
Parties and the MLP Parties further agrees that, if it shall become aware
prior to the Closing Date of any information that would cause any of the
statements in the Registration Statement or the Consent Statement/Prospectus
to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not false or misleading, it will
promptly inform the other party thereof and take the necessary steps to
correct such information in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or Consent Statement/Prospectus.



(c) Each of MLP and Parent shall (i) promptly notify the other of receipt of
any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government
official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or any other applicable
government official for amendments or supplements to any of the filings with
the SEC in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby or for additional information and (ii) promptly supply the other with
copies of all correspondence between MLP or any of its representatives, or
Parent or any of its representatives, as the case may be, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government official, on the other
hand, with respect thereto. Parent and MLP shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Consent Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement as promptly as practicable.

(d) MLP General Partner shall distribute to the Holders of MLP Common Units
the Consent Statement/Prospectus, which shall include a form of consent that

Consent, as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act.

Section 5.4 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances. From and
after the Execution Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof,
each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable and (ii) defend any lawsuits or other Proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or seek to
have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other Order
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing but
subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the parties hereto, from time to
time, whether before, at or after the Closing Date, shall execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, such instruments of assignment,
transfer, conveyance, endorsement, direction or authorization as may be
necessary to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will
require any party hereto to hold separate or make any divestiture not
expressly contemplated herein of any asset or otherwise agree to any
restriction on its operations or other condition in order to obtain any
consent or approval or other clearance required by this Agreement.

Section 5.5 No Public Announcement. On the Execution Date, Parent and MLP
shall issue a joint press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement and the Merger, which press release shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and MLP Conflicts Committee. From and after the Execution Date,
neither MLP nor Parent shall issue any other press release or make any other
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance
with this Agreement) (other than public announcements at industry road shows
and conferences or as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with the NYSE, in which event the party
making the public announcement or press release shall, to the extent
practicable, notify Parent and MLP Conflicts Committee in advance of such
public announcement or press release)



without the prior approval of Parent and MLP Conflicts Committee, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Section 5.6 Expenses. Subject to Sections 7.5 and 7.7, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, including legal fees, accounting fees, financial advisory fees and
other professional and non-professional fees and expenses, shall be paid by
the party hereto incurring such expenses, except that Parent and MLP shall
each pay for one-half of (a) any filing fees with respect to the Registration
Statement and the Consent Statement/Prospectus and (b) the costs of printing
and mailing of the Consent Statement/Prospectus; provided that, (i) if this
Agreement is terminated by MLP pursuant to Section 7.3, Parent shall bear all
of the costs and expenses of all parties incurred in connection with this
Agreement and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.4, MLP shall bear all of the costs and expenses of all parties
incurred in connection with this Agreement.

Section 5.7 Regulatory Issues. MLP and Parent shall cooperate fully with
respect to any filing, submission or communication with a Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over the Merger. Such cooperation shall include each of
the parties hereto: (a) providing, in the case of oral communications with a
Governmental Entity, advance notice of any such communication and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, an opportunity for the other party to
participate; (b) providing, in the case of written communications, an
opportunity for the other party to comment on any such communication and
provide the other with a final copy of all such communications; and (c)
complying promptly with any request for information from a Governmental Entity
(including an additional request for information and documentary material),
unless directed not to do so by the other party hereto. All cooperation shall
be conducted in such a manner so as to preserve all applicable privileges.

Section 5.8 Tax Matters. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for
purposes of any applicable state, local or foreign Tax that follows the U.S.
federal income tax treatment), the parties shall treat the Merger (a) with
respect to the Holders of MLP Public Units, as a taxable sale of such MLP
Common Units to DEI and (b) with respect to DEI, as a purchase of MLP Public
Units from the Holders of such MLP Common Units. The Merger Consideration
payable to the Holders of MLP Public Units shall be deemed to be (i)
transferred from Parent to DEI in a tax free transaction pursuant to Section
351 of the Code, and (ii) immediately thereafter transferred from DEI to the
Holders of MLP Public Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
The parties further agree that, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections
1.1032-3, the deemed transfer of the Merger Consideration from DEI to the
Holders of MLP Public Units does not trigger the recognition of gain by DEI
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the basis of Parent in stock of DEI
shall be increased by the value of the Merger Consideration. The parties will
prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing and will not
take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the course of any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law following a final determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other administrative settlement with or
final administrative decision by the relevant Governmental Entity.



Section 5.9 DandO Insurance.

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the MLP Group Entities to, honor all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, elimination of liability and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) now existing in
favor of the MLP DandO Indemnified Parties as provided in the Governing
Documents of any MLP Group Entity, under applicable Delaware Law or otherwise,
and shall ensure that the Governing Documents of MLP and MLP General Partner
(or their successor entities) shall, for a period of six years following the
Effective Time, contain provisions no less advantageous with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination of liability and
exculpation of their present and former directors, officers, employees and
agents than are set forth in the Governing Documents of MLP and MLP General
Partner as of the Execution Date.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
officers' and directors' liability insurance covering each MLP DandO Indemnified
Party who is or at any time prior to the Effective Time was covered by the
existing officers' and directors' liability insurance applicable to the MLP
Group Entities ("DandO Insurance") with respect to acts or omissions, or alleged
acts or omissions, occurring or allegedly occurring on or after July 1, 2017
and prior to the Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other Proceedings
relating thereto are commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the
Effective Time); provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to pay
an annual premium for the DandO Insurance for the MLP DandO Indemnified Parties in
excess of 300% of the current annual premium currently paid by the MLP Group
Entities for such insurance. In addition, Parent shall maintain in effect the
six-year "tail" policy obtained in connection with Alon USA Energy, Inc.'s
merger with and into Astro Mergerco, Inc. on June 30, 2017. Parent shall have
the right to cause such coverage to be provided under (i) Parent's corporate
officers' and directors' liability insurance program or (ii) the applicable
DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no
less advantageous to the MLP DandO Indemnified Parties than the existing DandO
Insurance, and, in either such case, such coverage shall satisfy the
provisions of this Section 5.9.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement for a period
of six years and expressly are intended to benefit each of the MLP DandO
Indemnified Parties and are enforceable thereby; provided, however, that in
the event that any claim or claims for indemnification or advancement set
forth in this Section 5.9 are asserted or made within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or
claims shall continue until disposition of all such claims. The rights of any
MLP DandO Indemnified Party under this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to any
other rights such MLP DandO Indemnified Party may have under the Governing
Documents of any MLP Group Entity or applicable Law.

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in
either such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that its



successors and assigns, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.9; provided, that no such assumption shall release
Parent from its obligations under this Section 5.9.

Section 5.10 Dividends and Distributions. After the Execution Date until the
Effective Time, each of Parent and MLP shall endeavor to coordinate with the
other regarding the declaration of any dividends or distributions in respect
of Parent Common Stock and MLP Common Units and the record dates and payment
dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that Holders of
MLP Common Units shall receive, for any quarter, either (i) distributions in
respect of MLP Common Units or (ii) dividends in respect of Parent Common
Stock that they receive in exchange therefor in the Merger. Subject to the
provisions of the MLP Partnership Agreement and Section 18-607 of the DRULPA,
the MLP Board shall declare, and shall cause MLP to pay, distributions in
respect of the MLP Common Units (a) in respect of the quarter ended September
30, 2017, in the amount of $0.43 per MLP Common Unit, with a record date of
November 13, 2017 and with a payment date occurring on or prior to November
22, 2017 and (b) if the Effective Time has not occurred prior to the record
date (the timing of which shall be consistent with MLP's past practice) for
distributions in respect of any quarter ending December 31, 2017 or
thereafter, then for, any such quarter, in an amount (x) consistent with the
MLP Board's existing cash distribution policy and (y) calculated in a manner
substantially consistent with MLP's past practice (including in respect of
reserves for maintenance capital expenditures, debt service and other
contractual obligations, and reserves for future operating or capital needs),
and with a record date and a payment date consistent with past practice with
respect to such quarter.

Section 5.11 Consent to Use of Financial Statements; Financing Cooperation.
The MLP Parties hereby consent to the Parent Group Entities' use of and
reliance on any audited or unaudited financial statements, including the MLP
Financial Statements, relating to the MLP Group Entities reasonably requested
by the Parent Parties to be used in any financing or other activities of the
Parent Parties permitted hereby, including any filings that the Parent Parties
desire to make with the SEC. In addition, the MLP Parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts, at the Parent Parties' sole cost and expense,
to obtain the consent of KPMG LLP (with respect to certain consolidated
financial statements of MLP) and Ernst and Young LLP (with respect to certain
consolidated financial statements of MLP) to the inclusion of the financial
statements referenced above in appropriate filings with the SEC. Prior to the
Closing, the MLP Parties will provide the Parent Parties such information, and
make available such personnel, as the Parent Parties may reasonably request in
order to assist any of the Parent Group Entities in connection with financing
activities permitted hereby, including any public offerings to be registered
under the Securities Act or private offerings.

Section 5.12 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the MLP Board
and the Parent Board shall take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispositions of MLP Common Units (including derivative
securities with respect to such MLP Common Units) or acquisitions of shares of
Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such
shares Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to MLP, or will



become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.13 Conflicts Committee. Prior to the Effective Time, none of the MLP
Group Entities shall (and none of Parent Group Entities shall, or shall cause
the MLP Group Entities to), without the consent of the MLP Conflicts
Committee, eliminate the MLP Conflicts Committee, or revoke or diminish the
authority of the MLP Conflicts Committee, or remove or cause the removal of
any director of the MLP Board that is a member of the MLP Conflicts Committee
either as a member of such board or such committee without the affirmative
vote of the members of the MLP Board, including the affirmative vote of each
of the other members of the MLP Conflicts Committee. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 5.13 shall not apply to the filling in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable Governing Documents of any vacancies caused by
the death, incapacity or resignation of any director.

that actions or inactions by MLP, MLP General Partner or any MLP Group Entity
shall not be deemed to be breaches or violations or failures to perform by
MLP, MLP General Partner of any MLP Group Entity of any of the provisions of
this Agreement (including for purposes of Section 6.2(a)) if such action or
inaction was or was not taken, as applicable, at the direction of (or on
behalf of) Parent or any Representative of any Parent Group Entity (whether or
not such Representative is acting in his or her capacity as a Representative
of a Parent Group Entity or an MLP Group Entity).

Section 6.6 Effect of Breach of Section 4.22. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Parent Parties may not assert
(individually or collectively with other breaches) any breach by the MLP
Parties of any representation or warranty set forth in Article III (whether
made as of the Closing Date or any earlier date) as a basis for (x) the
failure of any condition (including Section 6.2(a)) to be satisfied, (y) the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4 or (z) for MLP's
inability to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the proviso in Section 7.3,
in each case, if and to the extent that, with respect to such breach, Parent
was in breach of its representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.22.











ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 Termination by Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written agreement of the
parties hereto duly authorized by Parent Board, on behalf of Parent, and by
the MLP Conflicts Committee, on behalf of MLP.

Section 7.2 Termination by MLP or Parent. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be terminated by MLP or Parent if:

(a) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before June 30, 2018 (the
"Termination Date"); provided that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.2(a) shall not be available to Parent if the Parent
Parties or the MLP Parties fail to perform or observe in any material respect
any of their respective obligations under this Agreement in any manner that
shall have been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Effective Time to occur on or before such date; or

(b) a Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or taken any other action
(including the enactment of any statute, rule, regulation or executive order)
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and
such Order other action (including the enactment of any statute, rule,
regulation or executive order) shall have become final and non-appealable;
provided, however, that the Person seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) shall have complied with Section 5.3 and
Section 5.4.

Section 7.3 Termination by MLP. This Agreement may be terminated by MLP at any
time prior to the Effective Time if the Parent Parties shall have breached or
failed to perform any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the
representations or warranties of the Parent Parties set forth in this
Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (a) would (if it
occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) (with or without the passage of time)
and (b) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Parent Parties
prior to the Termination Date; provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall not be available to MLP if, at
such time, the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) cannot be satisfied (with
or without the passage of time).

Section 7.4 Termination by Parent. Subject to Section 6.5 and Section 6.6,
this Agreement may be terminated by Parent at any time prior to the Effective
Time if the MLP Parties shall have breached or failed to perform any of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of the MLP
Parties set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or
failure (a) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date)
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) (with or
without the passage of time) and (b) is incapable of being cured, or is not
cured, by the MLP Parties prior to the Termination Date; provided that the
right to terminate this



Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall not be available to Parent if, at
such time, the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) cannot be satisfied (with
or without the passage of time).

Section 7.5 Effect of Certain Terminations. In the event of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this Article VII, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision of this
Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability on the part of
any party to this Agreement and all rights and obligations of the parties
hereto under this Agreement shall terminate, except the last sentence of
Section 5.2 and the provisions of Section 5.5, Section 5.6, Article VII and
Article VIII shall survive such termination; provided, however, that nothing
shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any Willful Breach of
any covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement.

Section 7.6 Survival. None of the representations, warranties, agreements,
covenants or obligations in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Merger,
except for those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms
apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

Section 7.7 Enforcement of this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that an award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach of
this Agreement by any party and any such breach would cause the non-breaching
parties irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that prior to
the termination of this Agreement, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the parties will also be
entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance,
provided such party is not in material default hereunder. Such remedies will
not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in
addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to each of the
parties.

Section 8.2 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. To the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, the provisions of this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement involves at least $100,000 and
that this Agreement has been entered into in express reliance upon 6 Del. C. §
2708\. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally confirms and
agrees that it is and shall continue to be (a) subject to the jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Delaware and of the federal courts sitting in the
State of Delaware, and (b) subject to service of process in the State of
Delaware. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
consents and submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the
Delaware Court of Chancery (or, solely if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over any matter, any federal or state court
located in the State of Delaware) (the "Delaware Courts") for any actions,
suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such courts), (ii) waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and
agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation
brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum, (c) acknowledges
and agrees that any controversy that may arise under this Agreement is likely
to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to
a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (d) agrees to service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding shall be effective if such process is given as a notice in
accordance with Section 8.1 or in any manner prescribed by the Laws of the
State of Delaware. Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

Section 8.3 Entire Agreement; Amendments, Consents and Waivers.

(a) This Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto constitute the entire agreement
between and among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and
discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties, and there are no
warranties, representations or other agreements between or among the parties
in connection with the subject matter hereof except as set forth specifically
herein or contemplated hereby. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement
(including the representations and warranties set forth in Articles III and
IV), (i) the parties acknowledge and agree that neither the MLP Group Entities
nor any other Person has made, and the Parent Group Entities are not relying
upon, any covenant, representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to
the MLP Group Entities or as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding any MLP Group Entity furnished or made available to any
Parent Group Entity, (ii) the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
except as set forth in this Agreement, neither the Parent Group Entities nor
any other Person has made, and the MLP



Group Entities are not relying upon, any covenant, representation or warranty,
expressed or implied, as to the Parent Group Entities or as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding any Parent Group Entity furnished or
made available to any MLP Group Entity, and (iii) the MLP Parties and the
Parent Parties shall not have or be subject to any liability to any Parent
Group Entity or any other Person or any MLP Group Entity or any other Person,
as applicable, or any other remedy in connection herewith, based upon the
distribution to any Parent Group Entity or any MLP Group Entity of, or any
Parent Group Entity's or any MLP Group Entity's use of or reliance on, any
such information or any information, documents or material made available to
the Parent Group Parties or MLP Group Parties, as applicable, in any "data
rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in
expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, prior to the Closing, any
provision of this Agreement may be (i) consented to or waived in writing by
the party benefited by the provision or (ii) amended or modified at any time
by an agreement in writing by the parties hereto; provided, however, that, in
addition to any other approvals required by the MLP Parties' constituent
documents or under this Agreement, the foregoing consents, waivers, amendments
or modifications in clauses (i) and (ii), and any decision or determination by
MLP to (x) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3,
(y) waive any conditions set forth in Article VI and proceed to Closing or (z)
enforce this Agreement (including pursuant to Section 7.7), may be granted,
taken, made or directed by the MLP Conflicts Committee (without the need to
obtain any further approval of the MLP Board) and in all cases shall require
the approval of the MLP Conflicts Committee. No amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in
writing by the parties hereto. The failure of a party to exercise any right or
remedy shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver of such right or remedy in
the future. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless
of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided.

Section 8.4 Binding Effect; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; and Assignment. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns,
any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder, except (i) as provided in
Section 5.9 and (ii) for the right of the Holders of MLP Common Units to
receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing (a claim by the Holders of
MLP Common Units with respect to which may not be made unless and until the
Closing shall have occurred). No party hereto may assign, transfer, dispose of
or otherwise alienate this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise).
Any attempted assignment, transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of
this Agreement shall be null, void and ineffective.

Section 8.5 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of applicable
Law, or public policy, all other conditions or provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not



affected in any matter materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 8.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one instrument.

by their respective officers or agents hereunto duly authorized, all as of the
