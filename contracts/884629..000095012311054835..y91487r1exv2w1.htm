on the terms of the Escrow Agreement, such amount of the then remaining
amount of the Retention, as the Buyer, acting reasonably, considers necessary
to satisfy such Claim pending the determination thereof, and Clause 4.2
shall continue to apply in relation to the amount so retained. Any balance of
the Retention remaining after the determination of the last such Claim to be
determined shall be released to the Sellers upon such determination.

     9.6  |   | Procedure  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Save in respect of the Tax Warranties, the Buyer
shall promptly give notice to the Sellers on becoming aware of facts that are
reasonably likely to give rise to a claim under Clause 9.1(a), 9.2(b), or
paragraph 6.1 of Schedule 3, but which shall not constitute a claim for the
purposes of clause 9.4(a) or 9.4(b).  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | If any claim, demand, lawsuit, allegation, proceeding
or liability asserted by any third party against the Buyer or any member of
the Group (a "Third Party Claim") would result in a claim (other than in
respect of the Tax Warranties) by the Buyer against the Sellers under this
Agreement, the Buyer shall:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | ensure that the Sellers Representative is kept
informed of any actual or proposed material developments (including any
meetings), and that the Sellers Representative is provided with copies of
all material correspondence and documentation, relating to the Third Party
Claim or any material action taken or proposed to be taken in respect
thereof;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | ensure that any reasonable comments provided to the
Buyer on a timely basis by the Sellers Representative in relation to the
Third Party Claim and any material action to be taken in respect thereof are
taken into account;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | provide the Sellers Representative with a draft copy
of any material correspondence to be issued in relation to the Third Party
Claim (unless any delay caused in so doing would prejudice the ability of the
relevant Group member to defend the Third Party Claim) and ensure that any
reasonable comments thereon provided to the Buyer by the Sellers
Representative within 5 Business Days of its receipt of such draft are taken
into account; and  
      
    | (iv)  |   | use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the
Sellers Representative or its duly authorised agent may participate in any
material conversations or meetings in respect of the Third Party Claim
(whether in person or by telephone).  
   

  

       | (c)  |   | Without prejudice to Clause 9.7(a), the Buyer
shall not in any event be obliged to take or procure the taking of any action
in respect of the Third Party Claim:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | involving any proceedings before a tribunal,
court or other judicial body (other than the defence of a Third Party Claim);
or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | that the Buyer reasonably considers in good faith to
be unlawful, misleading or materially prejudicial in any way to the Buyer or
a Group; or  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (iii)  |   | that is inconsistent with the Buyers
reasonable view or opinion on the application of relevant Law or practice in
respect of or relating to the Third Party Claim.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (d)  |   | The Buyer or the relevant Group Company will be
free to satisfy or settle the Third Party Claim on such terms, or otherwise
deal with the Third Party Claim as it may think fit acting in good faith, but
shall before doing so obtain the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     9.7  |   | Certain General Provisions  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | The Buyer shall procure that reasonable steps and
proceedings are taken by the Buyer and each Group Company to mitigate any
Loss, but only to the extent the Buyer would have been obliged to do so under
English law if the claim was for damages rather than an indemnity.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | If (whether before or after payment of any claim by the
Sellers under Clause 9.1(a)) the Buyer actually recovers any amount from a
third party (including any insurer) in respect of that claim or its subject
matter, then the amount of the relevant claim shall be reduced  for  by
such recovery amount (less all costs incurred by the Buyer or any member of
the Group in making such recovery) and if the Sellers have already made
payment under such claim, the Buyer shall refund the lower of (i) the amount
actually received from such third party and (ii) the amount paid by
the Sellers, less in each case all costs incurred by the Buyer or any member
of the Group in making such recovery.  
      
    | (c)  |   | The remedies provided for in Clause 9.1(a) shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for any post-Closing claims made by
the Buyer for inaccuracies in, or breaches of, the Sellers Warranties, or
breaches or non-performance of covenants, agreements or obligations of the
Sellers, under this Agreement.  
      
    | (d)  |   | If the Buyer is entitled to claim under the Tax Deed or
under the Sellers Warranties in respect of the same liability, the Buyer may
claim under either or both but payments under the Tax Deed shall _pro tanto_
satisfy and discharge any claim which is capable of being made under the
Sellers Warranties in respect of the same liability and vice versa.  
      
    | (e)  |   | If the Buyer is entitled to claim under paragraph 6.1
of Schedule 3 or under the Sellers Warranties in respect of the same
liability, the Buyer may claim under either or both but payments under
paragraph 6.1 of Schedule 3 shall _pro tanto_ satisfy and discharge any claim
which is capable of being made under the Sellers Warranties in respect of
the same liability and vice versa.  
      
    | (f)  |   | The Parties agree to treat all payments made by the
Sellers to the Buyer under Clause 9.1(a), Clause 9.2, paragraph 6.1 of
Schedule 3, Schedule 6 and under the Tax Deed as adjustments to the Purchase
Price to the extent permitted by Law.

Buyer or the Company which would not otherwise have arisen, an amount equal
to:  
---|---|---|--- 
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (i)  |   | where such Relief is a right to a repayment of

    | (ii)  |   | in all other cases, the amount of Tax saved by the
Buyer or the Company as a result of the use or set off of that Relief,  
   

  

       |   |   | shall be set off against any payment then due from
the Sellers to the Buyer under this Agreement and the excess, if any, shall
be repaid to the Sellers by the Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable,
provided that in no circumstances will the Buyer be required to make a
payment under this Clause 9.9(a) in excess of the amount paid by the Sellers
to the Buyer under this Agreement in respect of the Loss in question.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | If the Buyer or the Company subsequently determines
(acting reasonably) or is subsequently notified by a Public Authority (in
either case, on or before the date of the expiry of the applicable statutory
limitation period (if any) for a Public Authority to make such a notification
in respect of such Relief) that such Relief, or any part of such Relief, is
disallowed or did not arise then the Buyer shall provide the Sellers
Representative with reasonable details of the Relief so disallowed or
not arising as soon as reasonably practicable. The Sellers shall within
fifteen (15) Business Days of the Sellers Representative receiving such
details pay to the Buyer an amount equal to:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | where such Relief is a right to a repayment of
Tax, the amount of that Relief so disallowed or not arising; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | in all other cases, the amount of Tax payable by the
Buyer or the Company as a result of such Relief being disallowed or not
arising,  
   

  

       |   |   | provided that in no circumstances will the Sellers
be required to make a payment under this Clause 9.9(b) in excess of the
aggregate amount of the amount set off and the amount repaid in each case as
referred to in Clause 9.9(a) in respect of the Relief in question.

       |   | or to such other address or to such other person as
either the Buyer or the Sellers Representative shall have last designated by
such notice to the other Party. Each such notice or other communication shall
be effective (i) if given by fax, when transmitted to the applicable number
so specified in (or pursuant to) this Clause 10.10 and an uninterrupted
transmission report is received, (ii) if given by courier, three
Business Days, after such communication is sent.  
---|---|--- 
      
  10.11  |   | Expenses  
      
    |   | The Sellers and the Buyer shall each pay their own expenses in
connection with or arising out of the negotiation, preparation and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including but not limited to the fees, expenses and disbursements of their
respective investment bankers, accountants and counsel.  
      
  10.12  |   | Remedies; Waiver  
      
    |   | Except to the extent this Clause 10.12 is inconsistent with any
other provision in this Agreement or applicable Law, all rights and remedies
existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any
rights or remedies otherwise available under applicable Law. No failure on
the part  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | of any Party to exercise, or delay in exercising, any
right hereunder shall be deemed a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise preclude any further or other exercise of such or any other
right.  
---|---|--- 
      
  10.13  |   | Severability  
      
    |   | If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable by any Public Authority, the remaining provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.  
      
  10.14  |   | Set off, default interest etc  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | The Buyer shall set-off any amount owing from the
Sellers under this Agreement against any amounts payable as part of the
Deferred Purchase Price. Any set off pursuant to this Clause shall be deemed,
for the purposes of this Agreement, to have been actual payments from the
Buyer to the Sellers and vice versa of the amount set off, notwithstanding no
cash payments were made. If the Buyer makes or purports to make any such set
off, it shall within 60 days of so doing provide to the
Sellers Representative sufficient details, including copies of all relevant
supporting correspondence and documents to enable the Sellers Representative
to gain a reasonable appreciation of the merits (if any) and the quantum of
the Buyers claim in respect of which such set off is made. If the Buyer
fails to provide such details or the Sellers Representative disputes the
amount set off, the Sellers (acting jointly through the Sellers
Representative) may commence arbitration proceedings against the Buyer
to recover the amount so set off or purportedly set off and to the extent
that the arbitrators shall determine that the relevant claims were not valid
or that the amount set off was excessive, the Buyer shall comply with any
arbitral award in that respect.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | The Buyer shall be entitled to withhold from payment of
any amount of the Deferred Purchase Price due to the Sellers an amount equal
to the Tax payable by the Sellers on such amount due, until the Sellers
deliver to the Buyer a receipt from the Tax authorities confirming that such
Tax has been paid by the Sellers, following which the Buyer shall pay such
withheld amount to the Sellers.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Any sum payable by the Sellers under this Agreement
shall be made free from any set-off or counterclaim, or any deduction or
withholding for or on account of Tax, save as may be required by Law. If any
such deductions or withholdings are required by Law to be made from any such
payments, the Sellers must provide such evidence of the relevant deduction or
withholding as the Buyer may reasonably require and pay to the Buyer such
increased amount as will ensure that, after the deduction or withholding
has been made, the Buyer will have received a sum equal to the amount that
the Buyer would otherwise have received in the absence of such deduction or
withholding.  
      
    | (d)  |   | If any Public Authority charges to Tax any sum paid to
the Buyer under this Agreement (the "original payment"), the Sellers will be
obliged to pay to the Buyer such an additional amount (the "additional
payment") as will ensure that, after the payment of the Tax so charged on the
original payment and any Tax chargeable on the additional payment, there will
remain a net sum equal to the amount of the original payment, the additional
payment to be paid three Business Days after the Buyer has served notice on
the Sellers that Tax on the original payment has become due and payable,
provided that no additional payment shall be due to the extent that
the original payment is subject to Tax solely as a result of the assignment
of the Agreement in accordance with Clause 10.6.  
      
    | (e)  |   | Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, if
there is a delay in the payment of any amount to be paid under this
Agreement, the liability of the obligor Party shall be increased to include
an amount equal to interest on such sum from the date when payment is due to
the date of actual payment (both before and after any arbitral award) at the
Euro base lending rate of HSBC Bank PLC plus 2%. Such interest shall accrue
from day to day and be  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | compounded quarterly and shall be payable without
prejudice to any other remedy available to the Parties in respect of such
default.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     10.15  |   | Payment of Claims  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Subject to Clause 10.15(b), where the Buyer makes
a Claim against the Sellers, then any amount due to the Buyer in satisfaction
of that Claim shall be paid (to the extent possible):  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | first as a deduction from the Retention; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | secondly, as a deduction from any Deferred Purchase
Price which is then actually due and payable,  
   

  

       |   |   | before the Buyer has recourse against any one or
more of the Sellers personally, and the Buyer agrees not to take enforcement
action against any of the Sellers until such funds referred to in (i) and
(ii) above have first been exhausted.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Clause 10.15(a) shall not compel the Buyer to deduct
from the Retention any Claim payable by the Sellers under Schedule 6, Clause
4.5, Clause 9.2(a), Clause 9.9 or clause 2.1(d) of the Tax Deed.  
   

  

     10.16  |   | Payments to the Sellers  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Any payment due from the Buyer to any or all of the Sellers
under this Agreement shall be paid to the account listed in Schedule 4, by
wire transfer in same day available funds, and the receipt of any such sum in
that account shall be a good and valid discharge by the Buyer of its
obligation to make such payment.  
      
  10.17  |   | Sellers Representative  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Subject to Clause 10.17(c), each Seller hereby
irrevocably appoints the Sellers Representative to act as their
representative for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Each Seller shall be bound by any steps or actions
taken or agreement entered into by the Seller Representative acting in
accordance with this Agreement.  
      
    | (c)  |   | If for any reason the Sellers Representative from time
to time shall not be able to act as such representative and the Sellers
nominate in writing another person to fill the role of Sellers
Representative hereunder, such other person as shall be so notified in
writing to the Buyer by the Sellers, shall be the Sellers Representative.  
   

  

     10.18  |   | Language  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Although the Parties may translate this Agreement into
different languages, the governing version shall be the English language
version.  
   

 

This Agreement has been executed on and takes effect as of the day and year
first above written.
