THE MERGER

  

  

1.1 The Merger.. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject
to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the FBCA, (i)
Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company, and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the FBCA as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and (iii) the separate existence of the

powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger.

  

  

1.2 Effective Time.. As promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or, to
the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles
VI, immediately after payment of the Closing Consideration to the
Shareholders, the Parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
(i) executing and filing on the Closing Date articles of merger in the form of
Exhibit B hereto with the Department of State of the State of Florida, in such
form as required by and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the FBCA (the "Articles of Merger"), and (ii) making such other filings and
taking such other actions as may be required by Law to make the Merger
effective hereinafter. The Merger shall become effective at 11:59 pm EST on
the Closing Date or such later date as the Articles of Merger are duly
accepted for filing with the Florida Department of State (the date and time
the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

  

  

1.3 Effect of the Merger.. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, in the Articles of Merger and in the
applicable provisions of the FBCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the assets,
property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of each of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

1.4 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.. At the Effective Time and without any
further action on the part of the Parties, (i) the Articles of Incorporation
of the Company shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, provided that such Articles of Incorporation shall, at the
Effective Time, be amended and restated so as to be in the form provided as
Exhibit C hereto, and (ii) the Company's bylaws shall be amended and restated
so as to be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D and, as so amended, such
bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein, in the Surviving Corporation's Articles of
Incorporation or by the FBCA.

  

  

1.5 Directors and Officers.. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

1.6 Effect of Merger on Capital Stock.

  

  

(a) The aggregate consideration (the "Total Consideration") to be paid
pursuant to this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub shall be $143,000,000
subject to adjustment as set forth in this Agreement .

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the holder of any shares of Company Stock or Merger Sub Common
Stock: (i) each share ("Share") of Company Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of the Company
Stock to be cancelled pursuant to clause (ii) below and any Dissenting Shares
as defined in and to the extent provided in Section 1.12) will be converted
automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Closing
Consideration Per Share; (ii) each share of Company Stock, if any, held by the
Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and (iii) each share of
Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share,
of the Surviving Corporation, and all of such shares, as converted, shall
thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Each share of Company Stock converted pursuant to
clause (i) of this Section 1.6(b) shall automatically cease to be outstanding
and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such share of Company Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive such
holder's respective portion of the Total Consideration, subject to adjustment
as set forth in this Agreement. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub
evidencing ownership of any shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall continue
to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

1.7 Payments at Closing.

  

  

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall pay the holder of each Share that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Shares
issued with respect to the exercise of options effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time and other than any Dissenting Shares or Shares owned by the
Company) cash in an amount equal to the Closing Consideration Per Share,
multiplied by the number of Shares held by such Shareholder (such amounts as
are paid in the aggregate to all Shareholders being referred to as the
"Closing Consideration"). As used herein, "Closing Consideration Per Share"
means (A) the sum of $143,000,000, as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.8(a), and
the total exercise prices of all Options with respect to which Option Holders
are entitled to receive Option Cancellation Payments minus the sum of: (I) the
Closing Bonus Payments, (II) the Transaction Expenses (III) the Closing Date
Indebtedness, if any, and (IV) the Reserve Account divided by (B) the sum of:
(I) the total number of Shares issued

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares
owned by the Company) and (II) the number of Shares covered by Options with
respect to which the Option Holders are entitled to receive Option
Cancellation Payments.

  

  

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit on behalf of the escrow
beneficiaries, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to $14,300,000 (the "Escrow Amount") in an escrow account (the "Escrow
Account") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the "Escrow
Agent"), pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit E, subject to such reasonable modifications as
shall be agreed to by the Escrow Agent and the Parties thereto (the "Escrow
Agreement"). Such Escrow Amount shall be funded from the Closing Consideration
payable to the Shareholders and Option Cancellation Payments payable to the
Principal Shareholders and the Principal Option Holders, who shall be the
Escrow beneficiaries. The Escrow Amount shall be held on behalf of each such
Escrow beneficiary and shall be determined as follows: In the case of a
Principal Shareholder or Principal Option Holder, each Principal Shareholder's
or Principal Option Holder's portion of the Escrow Amount shall be equal to
the Escrow Amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
aggregate Closing Consideration Per Share and/or Option Cancellation Payment
payable to such Principal Shareholder or Principal Option Holder, and the
denominator of which is the sum of the total Closing Consideration Per Share
and Option Cancellation Payments payable to all Principal Shareholders and
Principal Option Holders and the total Closing Consideration Per Share payable
to all other Shareholders. In the case of a Shareholder who is neither a
Principal Shareholder nor Principal Option Holder, such Shareholder's portion
of the Escrow Amount shall be equal to the Escrow Amount multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Consideration Per Share
payable to such Shareholder, and the denominator of which is the sum of the
total Closing Consideration Per Share and Option Cancellation Payments payable
to all Principal Shareholders and Principal Option Holders and the total
Closing Consideration Per Share payable to all other Shareholders. The portion
of the Escrow Account funded on behalf of the Principal Shareholder or
Principal Option Holder receiving both Closing Consideration and an Option
Cancellation Payment shall be funded in equal percentages from such person's
Closing Consideration and Option Cancellation Payment. The amount deposited
into the Escrow Account on behalf of each Shareholder or Principal Option
Holder as a percentage of the entire Escrow Amount shall be referred to as the
"Allocation Percentage".

  

  

(c) At the Closing, Parent shall provide funds (i) to the Company sufficient
to permit the Company to pay directly to each holder (an "Option Holder") of
options (each, an "Option") that is subject to an executed Option Cancellation
Agreement an amount for each share of Company Stock covered by the Option that
is subject to such Option Cancellation Agreement equal to the Closing
Consideration Per Share minus the exercise price of such Option. Such amount
shall be treated as consideration for the cancellation and termination of such
Option, in each case subject to applicable withholding Taxes; provided that a
portion of the payment due to a Principal Shareholder related to his or her
ownership of Options and a portion of the payment due to a Principal Option
Holder shall be paid to the Escrow Agent sufficient to fund such Principal
Shareholder's or Principal Option Holder's share of the Escrow Amount under
Section 1.7(b) which is attributable to the Principal Shareholder's or
Principal Option

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Holder's Option Cancellation Payment. The name of each holder of an Option,
together with the number of Options held by such individual, is set forth on
Exhibit F as such Exhibit may be amended from time to time prior to Closing to
reflect the expiration, termination or exercise of Options if any. The gross
amount to be paid to each holder of Options (both at Closing and, in the case
of the Principal Equity Holders, deposited in the Escrow Account) pursuant to
each Option Cancellation Agreement shall be referred to as an "Option
Cancellation Payment." Each Option Cancellation Payment (except to the extent
funded into the Escrow Account) shall be made by delivery of a Company payroll
check in the case of Option Holders who are employees or former employees of
the Company as of the Closing Date payable to the holder of Options to which
such Option Cancellation Agreement relates, less any Taxes and other amounts
required to be withheld with respect to such Option Cancellation Payment. The
Parties shall cooperate, and covenant and agree to take all commercially
reasonable actions, to structure the Option Cancellation Payments and the
Closing Bonus Payments and the Parent's funding of the Company's obligation
with respect thereto, such that the Tax deduction related to such payments is
properly recorded by the Company in the period prior to the Closing. To such
end, the Parties covenant and agree to not take any Tax or accounting position
inconsistent with the foregoing and shall file all Tax and accounting
information consistent with such approach. In the event that all or any
portion of the Tax deduction related to the Option Cancellation Payments
and/or the Closing Bonus Payments is finally determined not to be properly
included in the Company's final S Corporation Income Tax Returns for the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date, the Parent shall pay to the
Shareholders an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of the
actual deduction related to the Option Cancellation Payments included in the
final S Corporation Income Tax Return and (ii) the amount of such Tax
deduction if such deduction had been fully included, calculated at 40% of the
aggregate amount of such Option Cancellation Payments and/or Closing Bonus
Payments, and any such amount so paid by the Parent pursuant to this sentence
shall be characterized as additional Total Consideration. All Options not
otherwise cancelled and terminated in accordance with this provision will be
cancelled effective as of the Closing Date.

  

  

(d) At the Closing, Parent shall provide funds to the Company sufficient to
permit the Company to pay directly to each bonus recipient whose name appears
on Exhibit G, the amount set forth opposite his or her name and reflected as a
"Closing Bonus Payment", in each case subject to applicable withholding Taxes.

  

  

(e) At least two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Representative shall submit documentation (the "Payoff Instructions") setting
forth (i) the amount of all Transaction Expenses, in each case reasonably
expected as of the Closing Date, including the identity of each recipient,
dollar amounts, wire instructions and any other information necessary to
effect payment thereof, (ii) the wire instructions pursuant to which $200,000
will be wired to a segregated account maintained by the Representative for
certain administrative and other purposes post-Closing (the "Reserve Account")
and (iii) the amount of any Indebtedness reasonably expected as of the Closing
Date, together with payoff information and wire instructions with respect to
each holder of such Indebtedness (the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness,
the "Closing Date Indebtedness"). At the Closing, the Parent shall pay on
behalf of the Company and the Shareholders and in each case in accordance with
and as set forth in the Payoff Instructions, (x) all of the unpaid fees and
expenses owed as of the Closing by the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Company to its investment bankers, attorneys or accountants or otherwise
incurred by the Company (such fees and account being referred to as the
"Transaction Expenses") (y) the Reserve Account and (z) the Closing Date
Indebtedness.

  

  

1.8 Adjustments to Total Consideration.

  

  


 

  

At and after the Closing Date, and subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein, the Total Consideration shall be subject to adjustment in
accordance with this Section 1.8.

  

  

(a) Preliminary Consideration Adjustment. The Total Consideration shall be,
increased or decreased at the Closing, as the case may be, by the Estimated
Net Working Capital Adjustment, if applicable, as follows:

  

  

(i) Not later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall in good faith prepare and deliver to Parent an estimated balance
sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), a statement setting forth its best
estimate of the Net Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Net Working Capital") and a statement setting forth the Estimated
Net Working Capital Adjustment (taken together, the "Estimated Net Working
Capital Adjustment Statement"). The Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment
Statement will be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied in a manner
consistent with and using all of the same accounting principles, practices,
methodologies, consistent classifications, valuations, judgments and policies
as used in the Audited Financial Statements of the Company. The Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and in turn the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment
Statement shall not reflect any liabilities for Taxes, the Option Cancellation
Payments, the Closing Bonus Payments, the Transaction Expenses and any other
liabilities of the Company that will be paid on or prior to Closing. No
liabilities shall be reflected on or accrued in the Estimated or Closing
Balance Sheet for the 401(k)Employer Contribution Error (as herein defined).
Parent shall review the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement and provide
the Company with Parent's comments and/or proposed adjustment(s) made in good
faith to such Statement no later than two (2) business days after delivery to
Parent of such Statement, and in the event of any dispute regarding such
proposed Parent adjustments, the parties will (A) in good faith discuss and
attempt to reach agreement regarding such adjustments prior to the Closing
Date and (B) in the event agreement cannot be reached regarding the Estimated
Net Working Capital Statement pursuant to the immediately preceding clause
(A), any undisputed adjustments to Estimated Net Working Capital shall be
made, the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement and Estimated Net
Working Capital set forth thereon, respectively, shall be amended to reflect
such undisputed adjustments and either such amended Estimated Net Working
Capital shall become the final definitive Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement and Estimated Net Working Capital, respectively, for
purposes of Section 1.8 hereof (including without limitation Section
1.8(a)(ii) and Section 1.8(b)(v) hereof) or, if the disputed amounts are in
excess of $1.0 million, at the Company's request, Argy, Wiltse and Robinson,
P.C. ("Argy") shall on a pre-Closing, preliminary basis and subject in all
cases to the final determination of Closing Net Working Capital in accordance
with Section 1.8(b), resolve such disputed items, whereupon such items, as
resolved by Argy, shall be reflected in the Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement and Estimated Net Working Capital. For the avoidance of
doubt, the cash balance

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

reflected in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet delivered by the Company
shall be accompanied by appropriate bank confirmatory statements and shall not
be subject to dispute.

  

  

(ii) In the event that the Estimated Net Working Capital as reflected on the
Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement is in excess of the Target
Net Working Capital, then the Total Consideration shall be increased, on a
dollar for dollar basis, by the amount of such excess. In the event that the
Estimated Net Working Capital as reflected on the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment Statement is less than the Target Net Working Capital Amount, then
the Total Consideration shall be decreased, on a dollar for dollar basis, by
the amount of such shortfall. "Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment" means
the amount of the excess or shortfall as contemplated above which results in
an increase or decrease, as the case may be, to the Total Consideration in
accordance with this Section 1.8(a)(ii).

  

  

(b) Post-Closing Total Consideration Adjustment. The Total Consideration shall
be subject to adjustment following the Closing Date as follows:

  

  

(i) Within forty-five (45) calendar days after the Closing Date, the Parent
shall cause the Company to prepare and deliver to the Representative (i) a
balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
immediately prior to giving effect to the Closing, which shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with and using all of the
same accounting principles, practices, methodologies consistent
classifications, valuations, judgments and policies used in the Audited
Financial Statements of the Company (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) a
calculation of the Company's net working capital as of the Closing Date based
on the Closing Balance Sheet (which calculation shall be made in accordance
with the example set forth in Section 1.8(b) of the Disclosure Schedule) (the
"Closing Net Working Capital"), and together with the Closing Balance Sheet,
the "Closing Statement"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall reflect all actions
taken by the Company prior to the Closing and required to be set forth
thereon, but shall expressly exclude any and all liabilities for any Taxes,
the Option Cancellation Payments, the Closing Bonus Payments and the
Transaction Expenses and any other liabilities paid on or prior to Closing. No
liabilities shall be reflected on or accrued in the Closing Balance Sheet for
the 401(k) Employer Contribution Error.

  

  

(ii) The Parent shall cause the Company to make available to the
Representative and his independent accountants (if any) such books, records
and personnel of the Company as shall be reasonably necessary for the
Representative and his independent accountants to review the Closing
Statement. Each Party shall pay the costs, if any, of its own accountants and
advisors in connection with the adjustment to the Total Consideration
contemplated by this Section 1.8(b).

  

  

(iii) Unless the Representative notifies the Parent in writing that he
disagrees with any aspect of the Closing Statement (the "Objection Notice")
within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Closing Statement (which
Objection Notice shall include the Representative's objections, proposed
revisions and the basis therefore, in each case in reasonable detail (the
"Disputed Items"), along with any relevant supporting documents or data), then
the amounts set forth in the Parent's Closing Statement shall become final and
binding on the Parties and the Total Consideration shall be adjusted pursuant
to Section 1.8(b)(v) below. If

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the Representative timely provides an Objection Notice to the Parent, then the
Parent and the Representative will use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve promptly any Disputed Items. All items other than Disputed Items shall
be deemed to be agreed and shall be final and binding for the purposes of this
Section 1.8(b). Any Disputed Items not resolved by the Parent and the
Representative within thirty (30) calendar days after the Parent's receipt of
the Objection Notice (the "Remaining Disputed Items"), shall be resolved by a
nationally-recognized accounting firm mutually-agreed upon by the Parent and
the Representative, which accounting firm shall not have, as of the date of
its engagement under this Section 1.8 and within the three (3) years prior to
such engagement, a business relationship with Parent, the Company or the
Representative (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall be agreed-
upon and engaged by the Parent and the Representative within ten (10) calendar
days after Parent's receipt of an Objection Notice. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be paid jointly, one-half by the Parent and one-half
by the Principal Equity Holders. No later than thirty (30) calendar days after
the engagement of the Accounting Firm, as evidenced by its written acceptance
by facsimile or otherwise to the parties (the "Accounting Firm Engagement
Date"), the Parent, on the one hand, and the Representative, on the other
hand, shall each submit a brief to the Accounting Firm (with a copy to the
other party) setting forth their respective positions regarding the Remaining
Disputed Items. No later than thirty (30) calendar days after the earlier of
(x) submission of the last brief, or (y) the thirtieth day after the
Accounting Firm Engagement Date (the "Reply Deadline"), each of the Parent and
the Representative shall submit a reply brief (with a copy to the other
Party). The Accounting Firm shall render its decision resolving the dispute
within thirty (30) calendar days after the earlier of (A) submission of the
last reply brief or (B) the Reply Deadline. If additional briefings, a hearing
or other information is required by the accounting firm, the Accounting Firm
shall give notice thereof to the Parties as soon as practicable before the
expiration of such thirty (30) calendar day period, and the Parties shall
promptly respond with a view to minimizing any delay in the decision date.

  

  

(iv) The Accounting Firm shall not be entitled to consider any items or
matters other than the Remaining Disputed Items. The Accounting Firm shall be
instructed to render its decision in accordance with the terms hereof,
including GAAP, and shall deliver a written report to the Parent and the
Representative which sets forth its specific determinations with respect to
the Remaining Disputed Items. The determination of the Accounting Firm for any
of the Remaining Disputed Items cannot, however, be in excess of, nor less
than, the greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed for that particular
item in the relevant Closing Statement, in the case of the Parent, or in the
Objection Notice, in the case of the Representative. Each of the Parent and
the Representative agrees that, absent manifest error, they shall be bound by
the determination of the Remaining Disputed Items by the Accounting Firm and
such determination shall be used by the Parties to prepare a final calculation
of the Company's Net Working Capital as of the Closing. The Closing Balance
Sheet, as accepted by the Representative pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(iii), as
agreed upon by the Parent and the Representative or as determined by the
Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.8(b)(iv) shall be used to determine
the Company's net working capital (the "Finally Determined Net Working
Capital").

  

  

(v) If the Finally Determined Net Working Capital is greater than Estimated
Net Working Capital, then the Parent shall deliver to the Shareholders and
Principal Option Holders, pro rata based on their respective Allocation
Percentages" funds in an amount equal to the difference between (x) Finally
Determined Net Working Capital and (y) Estimated

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Net Working Capital. If the Finally Determined Net Working Capital is less
than Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Parent shall be entitled to
receive from the Shareholders and Principal Option Holders, pro rata based on
their respective Allocation Percentage, an amount equal to the difference
between (x) Estimated Net Working Capital and (y) Finally Determined Net
Working Capital. Up to $500,000 of any amounts due from the Shareholders and
Principal Option Holders pursuant to this Section 1.8(b)(v) shall be paid from
the Escrow Account.

  

  

(vi) All payments pursuant to this Section 1.8(b) shall be made in cash or
same day funds within five (5) calendar days after the final determination of
the Finally Determined Net Working Capital and shall include interest accrued
thereon since the Closing Date at a floating rate equal to the U.S. dollar
prime rate per annum, as quoted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., from time to
time during such period.

  

  

1.9 Surrender of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Delivery of Closing Consideration. Each record holder of certificates
evidencing shares of Company Stock to be exchanged pursuant to Section 1.6
(the "Certificates"), upon surrender to Parent or its designated
representative of any Certificates for cancellation, together with a letter of
transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (the "Letter of
Transmittal") duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor the
portion of the Closing Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 1.6 of this Agreement. At the Closing, Parent shall transmit the
applicable portion of the Closing Consideration to which such holder is
entitled in accordance with the terms hereof subject to receipt of all such
holder's Certificates for cancellation and such Letter of Transmittal. Until
so surrendered, each Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent
for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Total
Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such
Certificate. Any holder of Company Stock who has not complied with this
Article I shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as a general creditor thereof
with respect to the applicable portion of the Total Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Company Stock, without any interest thereon.

  

  

(b) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the applicable portion of the Total Consideration.

  

  

1.10 Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The applicable Total
Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Article I shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and thereafter there shall be no further registration or transfers of shares
of Company Stock on the records of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

1.11 Further Action. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable
or proper (i) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either the
Company or Merger Sub, or (ii) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or
their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
Merger Sub, all such other acts and things necessary, desirable or proper to
vest, perfect or confirm its rights, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of the
Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, and otherwise to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement.

  

  

1.12 Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(a) Each outstanding share of Company Stock as to which a written demand for
appraisal is duly made in accordance with Sections 607.1301-607.1333 of the
FBCA (the "Appraisal Rights Law") and which is neither (1) voted (or consented
in writing) in favor of adoption of this Agreement, or (2) owned by any
shareholder who shall have voted (or consented in writing) in favor of
adoption of this Agreement with respect to any other outstanding share of
Company Stock owned by such shareholder, shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the applicable portion of the Total Consideration
unless and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect, or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost, such appraisal rights under the Appraisal
Rights Law, at which time each such share shall be converted into the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Total Consideration. All such shares of
Company Stock as to which such a written demand for appraisal is so filed and
not withdrawn in accordance with the Appraisal Rights Law and which are
neither (A) voted (or consented in writing) in favor of adoption of this
Agreement, or (B) owned by any shareholder who shall have voted (or consented
in writing) in favor of adoption of this Agreement, except any such shares of
Company Stock the holder of which shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
such appraisal rights under the Appraisal Rights Law, are herein referred to
as "Dissenting Shares." The Company shall give Parent prompt notice upon
receipt by the Company of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawal of
such demands and any other written communications delivered to the Company
pursuant to the Appraisal Rights Law, and the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity, to the extent permitted by law, to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and shall not settle or
offer to settle any such demands; provided that nothing contained herein shall
limit or restrict the Company's ability to repurchase shares of Company Stock
from DeMinimus Shareholders. Any payments made with respect to Dissenting
Shares shall be made solely by the Surviving Corporation, and no funds or
other property have been or shall be provided by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
Parent's Affiliates for such payment.

  

  

(b) The Company covenants with Parent that as long as the Requisite Vote of
the Company Stock in favor of adoption of this Agreement is obtained, the
Company will exercise any drag-along rights it has with respect to shares of
Company Stock.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company covenants with Parent that the Company shall take in a timely
fashion all obligations imposed on the corporation by the Appraisal Rights
Law.

  

  

1.13 The Closing. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions precedent to Closing set forth in Article 6 hereof (other than
those conditions precedent that are to be satisfied at the Closing pursuant to
this Agreement), the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at such time on such date and at
such location as the Parties mutually determine, but in no event later than
five (5) business days after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
precedent to Closing set forth in Article 6 hereof (the "Closing Date"). At
the Closing, (i) the Principal Equity Holders and the Company shall deliver to
the Parent the various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in

days of the date of this Agreement) and not to take any action, directly or

(b) by Parent, if either the Principal Stockholders or the Company have

(c) by the Representative, if Parent has committed a material breach of any
provision of this Agreement that has not been cured within fifteen (15) days
of written notice of such material breach;

the Parties will take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party

Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefore
under Articles 9 or 10). The Principal Equity Holders acknowledge and agree

Company with respect to periods prior to the Closing until the later of (i)
the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; or (ii) the expiration of any
applicable period for assessment under applicable law (giving effect to any
extensions or waivers). Each of the Parent and Merger Sub covenants and agrees
to maintain (and not destroy) the Company's books and records until the later

the applicable period for assessment under applicable law (giving effect to
any extensions or waivers); provided, that, in no event shall the Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company destroy any specific books or records of the Company

provided pursuant to this Section 8.1 as "Confidential Information".

contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand after the Closing in
connection with any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act,
or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the Company, each of
the other Parties will cooperate with him, her or it and his, her or its
counsel in the contest or defense, make available their personnel, and provide
such testimony and access to their books and records as shall be necessary in
connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of
the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is
entitled to indemnification therefor under Article 9); provided, however that
no Party shall be obligated to provide such cooperation in connection with a
proceeding in connection with this Agreement.

8.3 Employee Benefits Matters.

  

  


 

  

  

(a) At the Closing and for a period of twelve months thereafter, the Parent
shall take all reasonable action so that employees of the Company as of the
Closing Date (the "Acquired Employees") shall be entitled to continue to
receive compensation and employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements that
are, in the aggregate, comparable to the compensation and Benefit Plans that
were offered to such Acquired Employees immediately prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.3(a) shall preclude the
Parent from making reasonable changes in Parent's discretion to the positions
or titles held by Acquired Employees or terminating individual Acquired
Employees in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) subject to the
provisions of this Section 8.3(a), transitioning any or all such Acquired
Employees to Parent compensation and benefit plans and programs.

  

  

(b) The Acquired Employees shall after the Closing continue to receive full
credit for service with the Company or any of its affiliates (or predecessor
employers to the extent the Company provides such past service credit) for
purposes of accrued leave entitlements and eligibility and vesting under
benefit plans and programs provided to the Acquired Employees after the
Closing to the same extent such service was recognized under the Company
Benefit Plans prior to the Closing (provided that such service shall not be
recognized for purposes of any benefit accruals under a defined benefit
Employee Pension Benefit Plan of the Parent).

  

  

(c) In the event of any change after the Closing in the Welfare Plans provided
for the benefit of the Acquired Employees, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts or cause the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts
to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under the new
Employee Welfare Benefit Plan in which the Acquired Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Closing, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
the Acquired Employee participated prior to the Closing. In the event of any
mid-year change in the health and medical benefit plans in which an Acquired
Employee participates after the Closing, to the extent commercially
practicable, Parent shall cause the new plan to recognize the dollar amount of
all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred during such year by
such Acquired Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) under the prior
plans for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under the new plans in which such Acquired Employee (and
dependents) commences participation.

closing obligations to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

be performed by the Company hereunder and (iii) enforcing any Parent
Indemnified Party's indemnification rights provided for under this Section

the extent such Losses relate to an unsuccessful claim brought to enforce the
indemnification provided for in this Section 9.2(a).

  

  

(b) Subject to the other terms of this Article 9, each Principal Equity Holder
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties from

representations and warranties made by the Parent and Merger Sub in Article 4,
(b) the failure of the Parent or Merger to perform any of its obligations to

9.4 Claim Procedure. The Indemnified Party shall give written notice of any
claim for indemnification hereunder to the Indemnifying Party. A claim for
indemnification may be made at any time prior to the expiration of any
applicable survival period with respect to such matter. The Parent and Merger
Sub shall cause the Company to make available to the Principal Equity Holders
and their respective representatives (if any) such books, records and
personnel of the Company as shall be reasonably necessary for the Principal
Equity Holders to evaluate any claim for indemnification, subject to the
execution by the Principal Equity Holders and their respective representatives
of a non-disclosure agreement.

  

  

9.5 Claims Between the Parties. If the claim is not asserted against or sought
to be collected by a third party, and neither the Principal Equity Holders (if
the Principal Equity Holders are the Indemnifying Parties), or Parent (if
Parent is the Indemnifying Party), notifies the Indemnified Party within
twenty (20) business days that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the
amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder. In case an objection is made in writing, the
Indemnified Party shall have fifteen (15) business days to respond in a
written statement to the objection. If, after such fifteen (15) business day
period, there remains a dispute as to any claim, the Parties shall attempt in
good faith for twenty (20) business days to agree upon the rights of the
respective Parties with respect

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

to each such claim. If the Parties should so agree, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement and the agreed upon dollar amount of liability for such claim
of the Party against whom the claim is made shall be prepared and signed by
(or on behalf of) the Parties.

  

  

9.6 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of a claim or demand asserted
by a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right, but not the obligation, exercisable by written notice to the
Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) business days of the date of the notice
of the claim concerning the commencement or assertion of any Third Party
Claim, to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party gives such notice of intent to defend, the Indemnifying
Party shall assume the defense thereof as follows: (i) the Indemnifying Party
will defend the Indemnified Party against the matter with counsel compensated
by and chosen by the Indemnifying Party, subject to the Indemnified Party's
reasonable prior approval of such counsel; (ii) the Indemnified Party may
retain separate co-counsel at the sole cost and expense of Indemnified Party;
(iii) the Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the matter without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned; and (iv) the Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to the matter, or enter into
any settlement, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In assuming
the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may reserve the
right to contest whether any or all of such claim is indemnifiable hereunder;
provided, that, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly relinquish its right to
represent the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim in the
event the Indemnifying Party subsequently determines that it is not liable to
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. If, however, (x)
no Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15)
business days after the Indemnified Party has been given notice of the matter,
that the Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense thereof or (y) the likely
maximum liability under such Third Party Claim is greater than the available
indemnification amount for the Indemnifying Party (after taking into account
the amount of all other claims for which the Indemnifying Party may be or may
be claimed to be liable and any limitations contained in Section 9.7 hereof),
then the Indemnified Party shall defend against the claim. No failure or delay
on the part of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall
limit any of the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this Article 9,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced thereby.
The Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

  

9.7 Limitations on Liability.

  

  

(a) The Principal Equity Holders shall not be required to make any
indemnification payments pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) until such time as the
total amount of all Damages that have been suffered or incurred by the Parent
Indemnified Parties, and for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled
to indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) hereof, exceeds $715,000 in the
aggregate (the "Deductible"), whereupon the Parent Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification hereunder for the aggregate amount of all
Damages in excess of the Deductible; provided that in no event shall the
Principal Equity Holders be liable under Section 9.2(a)(i) for any individual

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

items or aggregated items arising out of the same or similar facts, events or
circumstances where the Damages relating thereto are less than $20,000 (the
"Mini Basket"); provided, further, that neither the Deductible nor the Mini-
Basket shall apply to (i) any claim based on fraud or any claim for
indemnification for a breach of a Fundamental Company Representation, a
Fundamental Shareholder Representation or a Statutory Representation, or (ii)
any claim based on the Company's error in connection with its annual
nonelective employer contributions to its 401(k) Plan from January 1, 2004 to
December 31, 2008, as further described on Section 3.22(b) of the Disclosure
Schedules (the "401(k) Employer Contribution Error").

  

  

(b) (i) Except as set forth in Section 9.7(b)(ii), the Principal Equity
Holders' sole and exclusive liability for monetary damages under this
Agreement, and the Parent Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive recourse for
monetary damages against the Principal Equity Holders, for indemnification
under Section 9.2(a)(i) shall be limited to $14,300,000. Any indemnity claim
that is the responsibility of the Principal Equity Holders shall first be
satisfied from the Escrow Account.

  

  

(ii) The foregoing dollar limitations on the rights of the Parent Indemnified
Parties to seek or recover monetary damages from the Principal Equity Holders
shall not apply to the Principal Equity Holders' liability for (x) claims for
indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) with respect to breaches of any
Fundamental Shareholder Representation, Fundamental Company Representation or
Statutory Representation or (y) claims based on fraud, willful misconduct or
criminal acts.

  

  

(c) The representations and warranties of each Shareholder contained in
Article 2 and the Company contained in Article 3 constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of such Shareholder and the Company,
as applicable, to the Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. The representations and warranties of the
Parent and Merger Sub contained in Article 4 constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of the Parent and Merger Sub to the Company and
the Principal Equity Holders in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Except for such representations and warranties (in each case, as
modified by the applicable sections of the Disclosure Schedule), none of
Principal Equity Holders, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person
makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
such Parties or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except for
such representations and warranties (in each case, as modified by the
applicable sections of the Disclosure Schedule), each Party hereby disclaims
all liability and responsibility for any representation, warranty, projection,
forecast, statement, or information made, communicated, or furnished (orally
or in writing) to any other Party or its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives (including opinion, information,
projection, or advice that may have been or may be provided to any Party or
any director, officer, employee, agent, consultant, or representative of such
Party or any of its Affiliates).

  

  

(d) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification by an Indemnifying
Party hereunder shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party or the Company under insurance policies, other sources of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

indemnification, or otherwise, with respect to such Damages (net of documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such recovery); provided,
however, that no Indemnified Party shall have any obligation to seek to
recover insurance proceeds or any other amounts from third parties prior to
making an indemnification claim under this Article 9. Following the Closing,
and without affecting the Indemnified Party's rights to indemnification
hereunder (unless proceeds are recovered), the Indemnified Party shall, where
appropriate and commercially reasonable, make claims under applicable
insurance policies, other than self-insurance or retrospective policies, but
shall not have any obligation to engage in any litigation in connection
therewith. In the event an Indemnified Party or the Company receives any
recovery from insurers or otherwise with respect to such Damages after an
Indemnifying Party has made a payment in respect of such Damages, the
Indemnified Party or the Company, as the case may be, shall refund to the
Indemnifying Party the amount actually received by it (net of any expenses
incurred by such Person in collecting such amounts).

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes
of determining the amount of Damages for which the parties are obligated to
provide indemnification under this Article 9 (but not for purposes of
determining whether any breach has occurred to create such indemnification
obligations), all of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Disclosure Schedule)
that are qualified by materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or words of
similar import or effect will be deemed to have been made without any such
qualification.

  

  

(f) (i)The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
net of the present value of any Tax Benefit which would reasonably be expected
to occur (including by means of a "refund" as defined in Section 10.5) by any
Parent Indemnified Party on account of such Damages, including with respect to
any payment for Damages made hereunder and determined by using a discount rate
of 13% and by applying the marginal blended federal and state income tax rate
applicable to the relevant. Parent Indemnified Party for the year in which
such Damages are paid. Parent and the Company agree to provide the
Representative or its designated representatives with such documents and
records reasonably requested by them that are relevant to their ability to
determine when an amount is receivable from any Parent Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Section 9.7(f). Nothing herein contained shall affect a
party's legal duty to mitigate damages.

  

  

(ii) In the event that any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2,
reduces the amount treated as aggregate deemed sales price for Tax purposes
("ADSP") (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(3) and
§1.338-4) and such reduction in ADSP results in a Tax Detriment to the Parent
resulting from the concomitant reduction in amortization and/or depreciation
deductions (a "Tax Detriment), then the amount of the Tax Detriment shall be
taken into account at such time as any Tax Benefit is determined and shall
reduce the amount of such Tax Benefit. For purposes of this Section
9.7(f)(ii), a "Tax Detriment" shall mean the present value (determined by
using a discount rate of 13%) of the tax detriment determined by applying the
marginal blended federal and state income tax rate applicable to the Parent
for the taxable year of the Tax Benefit to the reduction in amortization
and/or depreciation deductions.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.8 Subrogation. Upon making an indemnity payment pursuant to this Agreement,
the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to
all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party (excluding any
material customer of the Company or the Parent) in respect of the Damages to
which the payment related. Without limiting the generality of any other
provision hereof, each such Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party will duly
execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and
perfect the above described subrogation rights.

  

  

9.9 Exclusive Remedy. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, should the
Closing occur, the indemnification provisions of this Article 9 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies for breaches of representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, the failure or non-performance of any covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, or any other claim in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (a) the
remedies arising from claims based on fraud, (b) the equitable and other
remedies available to the Parent contained in the Noncompetition Agreement,
(c) the remedies contained in the adjustment provisions of Section 1.8 and (d)
claims related to the 401(k) Employer Contribution Error, as set forth in
Section 11.16(f). The Parties acknowledge and agree that the remedies
available in this Article 9 and the items excepted in the first sentence of
this Section 9.9 supersede any other remedies available at law or in equity.
The Parties covenant not to sue, assert any arbitration claim or otherwise
threaten any claim other than those expressly provided for under this Article
9 or pursuant to the items excepted in the first sentence of this Section 9.9.

  

  

9.10 Mitigation. The Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Damages which form the basis of a claim hereunder.

  

  

9.11 Adjustment to Total Consideration. The Parties agree that any
indemnification payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the Total
Consideration.

  

  

ARTICLE 10

  

  

TAX MATTERS

  

  

10.1 Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The Shareholders shall
prepare and timely file all Tax Returns for the Company for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, including Tax Returns which reflect the deemed sale of the
Company's assets pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and including
any amendments to such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by
treating items on such Tax Return in a manner consistent with the past
practices with respect to such items, unless otherwise required by law. All
deductions related to any transaction-related expense, including any deduction
related to any compensatory payment (including, without limitation, the Option
Cancellation Payments and the Closing Bonus Payments except to the extent
Parent has paid Shareholders a purchase price adjustment for the tax benefits
associated with such items as contemplated in Section 1.7(c)) shall be
reported on the Company\'s federal income Tax Return for the taxable period
that includes the Closing Date. The amounts due for Taxes of the Company with
respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be paid from the Escrow Account.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.2 Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date. The
Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any
Tax Returns of the Company for Tax periods which end after the Closing Date.
In the case of any such Tax Returns for Tax periods that include the Closing
Date, such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Return
in a manner consistent with the past practices with respect to such items,
unless otherwise required by law. Any such Tax Return shall be provided to
Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing,
including any extensions, such Tax Return and the Representative shall have
the right to comment on and approve such Tax Return which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld. At least two days prior to the date on which Taxes
are due with respect to such periods an amount equal to the portion of such
Taxes which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the
Closing Date shall be paid from the Escrow Account. For purposes of this
Section 10.2, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
and are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such
taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Tax
based upon income, gain or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would
be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date, (y) in
the case of any sales and use taxes, be deemed to accrue as property is
purchased, sold, used, or transferred; (z) in the case of any Taxes other than
Taxes described in clauses (x) and (y), be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period. Any
credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period
ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice
of the Company. Any deduction for transaction-related expenses of the Company
including any deduction associated with the Option Cancellation Payments, the
Closing Bonus Payments and any Transaction Expenses shall be allocable solely
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (or, in connection with any Straddle Period, the
portion of such period ending on or before the Closing Date), except to the
extent that Parent has paid to Shareholders a purchase price adjustment for
the tax benefits associated with such Option Cancellation Payments or such
Closing Bonus Payments as contemplated by Section 1.7(c).

  

  

10.3 Structuring Transaction-Related Expenses. To the extent requested by the
Representative, Parent and Shareholders shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to structure or restructure the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as to allow all deductions related to any transaction-related
expense, including any deductions related to any compensatory payment
(including, without limitation, the Option Cancellation Payments and the
Closing Bonus Payments), to be properly reported on the Company\'s Income Tax
Returns for the Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

  

  

10.4 Amended Returns. Neither the Parent nor, after the Closing, the Company,
shall file or cause to be filed any Tax Return that relates to any Tax period
or portion thereof that ends on or before the Closing Date without the consent
of the Representative, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of
the Representative. Neither Parent nor its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company) shall to the extent it may affect or relate to the
Company, make or change any Tax election, change any annual Tax accounting,
enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment, initiate
any substantive discretionary

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

communication with any Taxing authority (or if communication is initiated by
any Taxing authority, provide a substantive response) without the
participation of the Representative or his advisors, surrender any right to
claim a Tax refund, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitations
period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or take or omit to take any
other action, if any such action or omission could reasonably be expected to
have the effect of increasing Tax liability of the Shareholders or the Company
for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date
(including the Shareholders' liability hereunder) or increasing the risk of a
Failed 338(h)(10) Election.

  

  

10.5 Refunds and Tax Benefits. Any Tax refunds that are received by the Parent
, its Affiliates or the Company and any amounts credited against Tax to which
any of the foregoing become entitled that relate to (i) any Tax period or
portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date or (ii) any other Tax
indemnified by the Shareholders under the terms of this Agreement, shall be
for the account of the Shareholders, and Parent shall pay over to the
Shareholders, pro rata based on their respective pre-Closing share ownership,
any such refund or the amount of any such credit within ten (10) days after
receipt, entitlement or use. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "refund"
shall mean the receipt of cash, an actual reduction in Tax paid and the use of
an overpayment as a credit or other Tax offset by Parent, its Affiliates or
the Company and any interest related to any of the foregoing.

  

  

10.6 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) The Parent, the Company and the Shareholders shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article 10 and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder and the execution of any Tax forms or filings requested by the other
Party consistent with the provisions of Article 10. The Parent shall provide
the Representative or its designated representatives with such documents as
are reasonably requested by the Representative as necessary or desirable to
implement the provisions of Section 10.1 (relating to the filing of Tax
Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods) and Section 10.8 (relating to Tax
Contests). The Company and the Parent shall (A) retain any books and records
in their possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (including any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, and abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) give the Representative
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the Representative so requests, allow the
Representative to take possession of such books and records.

  

  

(b) The Parent and the Representative further agree, upon request, to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  

  

10.7 Section 338(h)(10) Election.

  

  

Each of the Principal Shareholders will make (and the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to cause each of the other Shareholders to make) and Parent
agrees to make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect
to the Company and any comparable election under state Income Tax law (the
"Section 338(h)(10) Election") and the Principal Shareholders shall cooperate
(and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause each of the other
Shareholders to cooperate) in the completion and timely filing of such
elections in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation
§1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable provisions of state Income Tax law) or any
successor provision. In connection with the Closing, each Principal
Shareholder shall deliver (and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to
cause each other Shareholder to deliver) the executed Section 338 Forms to the
Parent. The Parent shall be responsible for the filing of the Section 338
Forms. The Principal Shareholders (to the extent so advised by Parent pursuant
to the provisions of this Section 10.7) will comply, and the Company will use
reasonable efforts to cause the Shareholders to comply, fully with all
reasonable filing and other requirements necessary to effectuate such Section
338(h)(10) Election on a timely basis and agree to cooperate in good faith
with Parent in the preparation and timely filing of any additional forms,
elections or Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with the making of
such Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Shareholders will include any income,
gain, loss, deduction or other Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election on their Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Law. The
Parent and Representative shall act in good faith to, within 100 days of the
Closing Date (i) determine and agree upon the amount of the aggregate deemed
sales price ("ADSP") (within the meaning to Treas. Reg. §1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(3)
and §1.338-4 and (ii) agree upon the proper allocations (the "Allocations") of
the ADSP among the assets of the Company in accordance with Treas. Reg.
§1.338(h)(10)-1(d) (3), §1.338-6, and §1.338-7 and Section 10.6 of the
Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that if the Purchase Price is
adjusted, including as a result of a final determination of the payments
contemplated by Section 1.8(b) hereof, and such Purchase Price adjustment is
finalized after ADSP and the Allocations have been determined hereunder, then
Parent and the Representative shall act in good faith as soon as practicable
and will make all reasonable efforts to so act within 14 days of the date such
Purchase Price adjustment is finalized to determine and agree upon the
appropriate adjustments to be made to ADSP and the Allocations as a result of
such Purchase Price adjustment. None of the Parties shall take any position on
any Tax Return inconsistent with the Allocations and each of the Parties shall
reflect the Allocations where relevant in all Tax filings, including IRS Form
8883.

  

  

10.8 Section 338(g) Election. Neither Parent nor the Company shall make any
election under Section 338(g) of the Code (or any comparable provisions of
state or local Income Tax law) or any successor provision.

  

  

10.9 Tax Matters. Parent shall promptly provide the Representative with
written notice of any audit, investigation or claim by any Taxing authority
that could give rise to an obligation on the part of any Shareholder to
indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party under this Agreement or any other Tax
that may be the Shareholders' responsibility. If any Taxing

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

authority conducts any audit or investigation relating to the Company for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or with respect to any Tax for which the Shareholders
are responsible including, without limitation, any item that could give rise
to an Estimated Tax Increase resulting from a Failed 338(h)(10) Election, the
Representative may, in his sole election, have the right to represent the
Company in such audit or investigation and to provide any response required in
connection therewith; provided that Parent shall receive copies of all filings
and documents and may participate at its own expense in such proceedings to
the extent that such proceedings relate to any Straddle Period, or otherwise
relates to a Tax for which the Shareholders may not be solely responsible. In
no event shall Parent and, after the Closing Date, the Company, settle any
audit or investigation relating to any period or portion thereof that ends on
or before the Closing Date or any Tax for which the Shareholders are
responsible without the prior written consent of the Representative, which
consent will be withheld in the Representative's sole discretion as it relates
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (but only if the Shareholders are fully
responsible for any such Tax) and otherwise shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed to the extent that it relates to any Straddle Period or relates to
any Tax for which the Shareholders may not be fully responsible.

  

  

10.10 Transfer Taxes and Fees. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and other governmental charges, and all
conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne one-half by the
Shareholders and one-half by the Parent. The Parent agrees to file all
required change of ownership and similar statements.

(a) The Company, Merger Sub and the Parent agree that, from the date hereof
through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by any Party without

may be required by law or the rules or regulations of any United States
securities exchange, in which case the Party required to make the release or
announcement shall allow the other Parties reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may make internal announcements to its employees.

  

  

(b) The Company, Merger Sub and the Parent shall mutually agree upon an
initial press release to be issued by the Parent and the Company immediately

rules or regulations of any United States securities exchange, in which case
the Party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other
Parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance

9.2 and Section 9.3, this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies
upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and

11.4 Succession and Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named

provided, however, that the Parent may, without the approval of the
Representative (i) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to

or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,

court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the
Parties agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or

expenses (including, without limitation, any of his legal or accounting fees
and expenses) in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to the extent such fees and expenses are paid prior to
Closing; otherwise all Transaction Expenses shall be paid by the Principal
Equity Holders.

requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include the masculine and feminine genders. The Parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation of this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden

"Failed 338(h)(10) Election" shall mean a final determination by the Internal

thousand dollars ($20,700,000). If the final determination for the Failed
338(h)(10) Election provides for a Tax assessment for the taxable year of
Parent in which the Closing occurs (such year, the "Closing Year"), then the
Failed 338(h)(10) Election Cap shall be twenty million seven hundred thousand
dollars ($20,700,000). If the final determination for the Failed 338(h)(10)
Election does not apply to the Closing Year either because of the expiring of
the statute of limitations period for the Closing Year or because the Internal
Revenue Service otherwise did not pursue what would have been a valid
assessment for such year resulting from the Failed 338(h)(10) Election, then
the first step in calculating the Failed 338(h)(10) Election Cap shall be to
determine the difference between (i) twenty million seven hundred thousand
dollars ($20,700,000); and (ii) the Tax benefits available to Parent and its
subsidiaries by reason of the Section 338(h)(10) Election during the Closing
Year (such difference, the "Modified Cap"). In addition, in determining the
Failed 338(h)(10) Election Cap in situations where the year in which the first
Tax assessment related to a final determination of a Failed 338(h)(10)
Election (such year, the "First Assessment Year") occurs in a taxable years
after the Closing Year because of the expiring of the statute of limitation
periods for one or more Tax Years or because the Internal Revenue Service
otherwise did not pursue what would have been a valid Tax assessment with
respect to such years resulting from the Failed 338(h)(10) Election ("Closed
Years"), the Failed 338(h)(10) Election Cap shall be further reduced by

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

reducing the Modified Cap proportionately based upon the number of Closed
Years that have passed between the Closing Year and First Assessment Year.
Specifically, where the First Assessment Year occurs after the Closing Year,
the Failed 338(h)(10) Election Cap shall be calculated as the product of (A)
the Modified Cap; and (B) the quotient determined where (1) the numerator
represents the difference between (x) fourteen and (y) the number of Closed
Years that have passed between the Closing Year and the First Assessment Year;
and (2) the denominator is fourteen.
