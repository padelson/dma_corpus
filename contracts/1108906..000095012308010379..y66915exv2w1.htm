 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of August 29, 2008, by and among Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation (" _Parent_ "), Crisp Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and Greenfield Online, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 _W_   _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_   _T_ _H_ : 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Sub and Parent has approved and declared advisable, this Agreement and the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent proposes to cause Sub (the " _Offeror_ ") to commence a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), at the Offer Price, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (such tender offer, as it may be amended and supplemented from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, after Offeror acquires the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than any Cancelled Shares, Remaining Shares or Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously determined that the terms of this Agreement constitute a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 15, 2008, by and among QGF Acquisition Company Inc., QGF Merger Sub Inc. and the Company (the " _Prior Agreement_ ")), the Company and its Board of Directors have taken all such actions as are necessary, advisable and proper to terminate the Prior Agreement, and the Prior Agreement has been validly terminated and is no longer in force or effect; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Company has paid $5,000,000 to QGF Acquisition Company Inc. in full satisfaction of the Company Termination Fee (as defined in the Prior Agreement); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto (intending to be legally bound) hereby agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE OFFER  

  

   Section 1.01 _The Offer_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and provided that none of the events set forth in clauses (iii)(A), (iii)(B), (iii)(C) or (iii)(D) of Annex II to this Agreement has occurred and is continuing, as promptly as practicable and in any event no more than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Offeror shall, and Parent shall cause Offeror to, commence, within the meaning of Rule l4d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the Offer. The obligation of Offeror to, and of Parent to cause Offeror to, accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered shall be subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Annex II (the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "); _provided_ that Parent and Offeror may, without the consent of the Company (but, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to Sections 1.01(c) and 1.01(d)), increase the Offer Price and waive any of the Tender Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition, which may not be waived without the prior written consent of the Company) and make changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer except that, without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Offeror nor Parent may change the form of consideration to be paid, decrease the Offer Price or the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer, reduce the time period during which the Offer shall remain open, or modify any of the Tender Offer Conditions or amend any other term of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock. The Company agrees that no Cancelled Shares or Remaining Shares will be tendered in the Offer. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable and in any event no more than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and Offeror shall file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer, which shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities Laws, and shall contain or incorporate by reference the offer to purchase relating to the Offer and forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement other appropriate documents (which documents, as amended or supplemented from time to time, are referred to herein collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Offeror further agree to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent and Offeror all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Companys stockholders that may be required under the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents, and Parent and Offeror shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel prior to their filing with the SEC (it being understood that the Company and its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable). Parent and Offeror agree to provide the Company (in writing, if written), and to consult with the Company and its counsel regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff (whether written or oral) with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof and any responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written and oral comments and proposed responses. Each 

     ##### 

  

    

of Parent, Offeror and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and
Offeror further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case, as and to the extent
required by Law. 

   

 (c) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, the "initial scheduled expiration date of the Offer" shall be twenty (20) business days (as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after (and including the day of) the date of its commencement (such date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Offeror shall not, and Parent agrees that it shall cause Offeror not to, terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Offeror and Parent may, without receiving the consent of the Company, extend the Expiration Date for any period required by applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the NASDAQ Global Market or any other stock exchange or automated quotation system applicable to the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Offeror shall, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, extend the Offer from time to time if at any scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer any of the Tender Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived; _provided_ that such extension shall be for a period that is not more than ten (10) Business Days after such previously scheduled Expiration Date (unless otherwise reasonably agreed by the parties). In the event the Acceptance Date occurs but Parent does not acquire a number of shares of Company Common Stock sufficient to enable a Short Form Merger to occur (assuming exercise of the Top-Up Option in full), Offeror may, without the consent of the Company, undertake one or more "subsequent offering periods" for the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act for a number of days to be determined by Parent, which shall be not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate (it being understood that any "subsequent offering period" shall not extend the Expiration Date). 

   

 (d) Subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, waiver by Parent or Offeror) of the Tender Offer Conditions, Offeror shall, and Parent shall cause Offeror to, immediately accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the first date of acceptance for payment and payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ " and the time of acceptance for payment and payment on the Acceptance Date, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") on or after the Expiration Date. If Offeror shall commence a subsequent offering period in connection with the Offer, Offeror shall immediately accept for payment and pay as soon as possible for all additional shares of Company Common Stock tendered during such subsequent offering period, subject to and in compliance with the requirements of Rule 14d-11(e) under the Exchange Act. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Offeror on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that Offeror becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. 

   

  Section 1.02 _Company Actions_. 

   

 (a) The Company hereby approves this Agreement and consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation (as hereinafter defined), subject 

    ##### 

  

    

only to the Companys rights to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.02. 

   

 (b) The Company shall file with the SEC, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall reflect, subject only to the provisions of Section 5.02, the Company Board Recommendation, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to stockholders of the Company as required by Rule 14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. To the extent practicable, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Offeror in mailing or otherwise disseminating the Schedule 14D-9 with the appropriate Offer Documents to the Companys stockholders. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall deliver copies of the proposed form of the Schedule 14D-9 to Parent within a reasonable time prior to the filing thereof with the SEC for review and comment by Parent and its counsel, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel (it being understood that Parent and its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable). The Company agrees to provide Parent (in writing, if written), and to consult with Parent and its counsel regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff (whether written or oral) with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt thereof and any responses thereto. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written and oral comments and proposed responses. Each of the Company, Parent and Offeror shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as and to the extent required by applicable Laws. 

   

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly provide Parent with (or cause Parent to be provided with) mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the shares of Company Common Stock as of a recent date, and shall provide Parent with such information and assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the stockholders of the Company. 

   

   Section 1.03 _Board Representation_. 

   

 (a) Subject to applicable Law, immediately upon payment by Offeror for shares of Company Common Stock accepted at the Acceptance Time, and from time to time thereafter as shares of Company Common Stock are acquired by Parent or Offeror, Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Offeror representation on the Board of Directors of the Company of at least that number of directors which equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and/or Offeror (including for purposes of this Section 1.03 such shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment) bears to the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the Companys Board of Directors, including, 

    ##### 

  

    

subject to applicable Law and the Company Certificate, increasing the size of
the Board of Directors and/or securing the resignations of incumbent
directors. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to enable individuals designated by Parent to constitute
the same percentage as is on the entire Board of Directors of the Company
(after giving effect to this Section 1.03) to be on (i) each committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company and (ii) subject to applicable Law and the
Company Certificate, each Board of Directors and each committee thereof of
each Subsidiary of the Company. The Companys obligations to
appoint designees to its Board of Directors shall be subject to compliance
with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. Subject to applicable Law, and
subject to Parent supplying the Company as promptly as practicable with the
information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder, at the request of Parent, the Company shall promptly
take, at its expense, all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 under the Exchange Act in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 1.03(a) and shall include in the originally filed Schedule 14D-9 and
otherwise timely mail to its stockholders all necessary information to comply
therewith. Parent will supply to the Company, and be solely responsible for,
all information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and
Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the Acceptance Time until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Board of Directors to always have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the date hereof, who are not employed by the Company and who are not Affiliates or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and who are independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ that, if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below two (2) for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Continuing Directors (or Continuing Director, if there is only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate any other Person(s) who shall not be an Affiliate or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Person(s) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director(s) for purposes of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the remaining Continuing Directors shall fill such vacancies as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days, and further provided that if no such Continuing Director is appointed in such time period, Parent shall designate such Continuing Director(s); _provided_ , _further_ , that if no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall designate two (2) Persons who shall not be Affiliates consultants, representatives or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the election or appointment of any of Parents designees pursuant to Section 1.03 and until the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of any obligation of, or action hereunder by, Parent or Sub (or Offeror), (iii) exercise, enforce or waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, (iv) take any action to seek to enforce any obligations of Parent or Sub (or Offeror) under this Agreement or (v) take any other action by the Company under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Continuing Directors shall have the 

     ##### 

  

    

authority to retain counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company)
at the reasonable expense of the Company for the purpose of fulfilling their
obligations hereunder and shall have the authority, after the Acceptance
Date, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the
performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

   

   Section 1.04 _Top-Up Option_. 

   

 (a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Offeror an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.04, to purchase up to that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to a number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Offeror and its Subsidiaries) at the time of such exercise, shall constitute the least amount required so that Parent and Offeror own more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis (as provided below) immediately after exercise of the Top-Up Option at a price per share as set forth below; _provided_ that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the Companys then authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock. For purposes of percentage of ownership calculations with respect to the Company under this Agreement, "fully diluted basis" assumes the conversion or exercise of all derivative securities or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof, other than any shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option. The purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be equal to the Offer Price, which price shall be payable either, at Offerors election, (A) entirely in cash or (B) in cash in an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the purchased Top-Up Option Shares and by the issuance of a full recourse note with a principal amount equal to the remainder of the exercise price. 

   

 (b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable by Offeror, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the Acceptance Time (so long as the exercise of the Top-Up Option would, after the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock thereunder, be sufficient to allow the Short Form Merger to occur), and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (A) no Law or Order (each as defined in Section 4.01(d)) shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of all or a portion of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (B) no Governmental Entity or self-regulatory organization including any stock exchange shall have threatened any action with respect thereto, (C) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Offeror constitutes more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, and (D) Offeror has accepted for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. Without limiting the obligations set forth in Section 6.03, if the Top-Up Option shall not be exercised in whole or part by Offeror within five (5) Business Days of the Acceptance Time to the extent necessary to allow the Short Form Merger to occur, the Offeror shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Company to obtain, as soon as practicable, such required stockholder approval or, pursuant to Section 6.01, the Stockholder Approval and to consummate the Merger. 

   

 (c) Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with Section 1.04(a), Parent shall so notify the Company and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of shares of 

     ##### 

  

    

Company Common Stock that are expected to be owned by Parent, Offeror or any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Offeror immediately preceding the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) a place and time for the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (and the Company shall
issue the Top-Up Option Shares at such designated time). The Company shall,
as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and
Offeror of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and
the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares, Parent or Offeror, as the case may be, shall pay
the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option
Shares pursuant to Section 1.04(a), and the Company shall cause to be issued
to Parent or Offeror a certificate or book-entry shares representing the Top-
Up Option Shares. 

   

 (d) Parent and Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares which Offeror may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Offeror is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.

ARTICLE III 

   

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
 CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Sub or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub: 

   

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing common stock of Sub, if any, shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Remaining Shares and Treasury Stock._ Each Remaining Share, if any, and each share of Company Common Stock that is held in treasury by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

      ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Subject to Section 3.02(j), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (the " _Remaining Shares_ ") and (ii) any Cancelled Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, subject to Section 3.02(j), all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (i) the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, (ii) the Company declares or pays any cash dividend on the Company Common Stock or (iii) the Company declares or pays any non-cash dividends or distributions on the Company Common Stock, then in any such case the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such action;  _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 3.01(c) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. The right of any holder of a share of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.02(c) shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law. 

   

 Section 3.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and shall use its reasonable best efforts to enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit (from and after the Effective Time) of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.01(c). All cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 3.02(a) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of book-entry shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of one or more Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, together 

    ##### 

  

    

with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.01(c), and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Section 3.02(b) may be made to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered
if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer) and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 3.02(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry
Share (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting
Shares, Cancelled Shares and Remaining Shares) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or will
accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No payment of Merger Consideration shall be paid to any such holder, in each case, until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have surrendered such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article III. Following the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the record holder of the Certificate representing whole shares of Company Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, or to the record holder of the Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable in respect therefor in accordance with this Article III. 

   

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III. 

   

 (e) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article III. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any person in respect of 

     ##### 

  

    

any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the
date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the entering into of an indemnity or the posting of a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III. 

   

 (i) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (j) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and has properly perfected dissenters rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder to the extent permitted by, and in accordance with the provisions and pursuant to the procedures of, Section 262 of the DGCL; 

     ##### 

  

    

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if any Dissenting Stockholder, under the
circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively
withdraws such holders demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (ii)
if any Dissenting Stockholder fails to establish such holders entitlement to
dissenters rights as provided in the DGCL or (iii) if any Dissenting
Stockholder takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which is
that such holder is not entitled to payment under Section 262 of the DGCL for
such holders shares, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall
forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into and represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (without interest) payable in respect of such shares
of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous
sentence. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in (and the Company shall provide Parent
the opportunity to participate in) all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with
respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares
without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

  Section 3.03 _Stock Options_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to provide that each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) shall at the Acceptance Time be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the per-share Merger Consideration exceeds the per-share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock then subject to such Company Stock Option which shall not theretofore have been exercised (the " _Option Settlement Amount_ " and for all the Company Stock Options, the " _Aggregate Option Settlement Amount_ "), without interest, and less all required tax withholdings. At the Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Company, cash in U.S. dollars, sufficient to pay the amount set forth in this Section 3.03(a) in respect of the Company Stock Options and the Company shall use the cash deposited by Parent to pay all holders of Company Stock Options the cash payments described in this Section 3.03(a) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Acceptance Time occurs, but in any event within five Business Days thereafter. Following the Acceptance Time, no Company Stock Option shall remain outstanding and all holders of a Company Stock Option that was outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall only be entitled to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 3.03(a). 

   

 (b) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options and to participants in the Companys 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights and shall obtain any consents from such persons reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.03(a) and Section 3.03(d). Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall (i) be permitted to accelerate the vesting of any Company Stock Option intended to be an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code (" _ISO_ " ), (ii) take any action necessary or advisable to permit a "broker-assisted cashless exercise" of any ISOs and (iii) adopt such resolutions as may be required to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.03(a) and Section 3.03(d). 

   

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) " _Company Stock Option_ " means any option or right to purchase Company Common Stock under any Company Stock Plan (other than the 

    ##### 

  

    

ESPP) and 611,800 options granted to Albert Angrisani, the Companys Chief
Executive Officer, outside of the Company Stock Plans (the " _CEO Option_ ");
and (ii) " _Company Stock Plans_ " means the Companys Amended and Restated
1999 Stock Option Plan, the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and the
ESPP. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary and satisfactory to Parent to terminate the ESPP effective as of or prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to avoid the commencement of any new offering period under the ESPP at or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, including but not limited to, amending the terms of the ESPP. Following the date of this Agreement, participants in the ESPP may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections under the ESPP from those in effect on the date of this Agreement. Each participants outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under any outstanding offering period as of the date of this Agreement under the ESPP shall terminate on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs, provided that the Company will permit each participant to purchase from the Company as many whole shares of Company Common Stock as the balance of the participants account will allow, at the applicable price determined under the terms of the ESPP for such outstanding offering periods using such date as the final purchase date for each such offering period, and any amounts remaining in a participants account after any such purchase will be refunded to the participant. 

   

 (e) Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Stock Options and any participant under the ESPP such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Stock Options or to the participant in the ESPP, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

the Company, (K) transfer assets of the Company or any Subsidiary to or from
the Company or any other Subsidiary as Parent may reasonably request and (L)

same level of access to information as is afforded to Parent and Parents
Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.02(a), provided that any such ISS
Buyer shall have first entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _ISS Buyer_ " shall mean any person

     ##### 

 

  

Person set forth as a direct competitor in Section 6.02(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Direct Competitor_ ") to the extent
that the Company reasonably determines that providing such cooperation or
information to the Direct Competitor could be harmful to the Company and any
such person shall not be deemed to be an ISS Buyer for purposes of
this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give to Parent or
its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Acceptance Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in subsections (F), (J), (K) and (L)
of this Section 6.02(a) shall require the Company to take any action that
would be effective prior to the Acceptance Time, and nothing in this Section
6.02(a) shall require the Company to take any action prior to the Acceptance
Time to the extent it would, in the Companys reasonable judgment, interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company. Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
documented and reasonable out-of-pocket third party costs incurred by the
Company in connection with any cooperation pursuant to this Section 6.02(a)
in the potential separation and sale of the ISS Business.

The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Any potential ISS Buyer that is identified to the Company in writing pursuant to Section 6.02(a) and that is not a Direct Competitor shall constitute a "Representative" of Parent under this Agreement and under the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

   

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper and advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) that the Tender Offer Conditions and conditions set forth in Article VII are satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, and approvals from Governmental Entities and non-governmental third parties and the making of all necessary registrations, notices and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (A) file as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 10 Business Days) with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") the notification and report form (the " _HSR Filing_ ") required under the HSR Act with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) make, as promptly as practicable, all notifications and 

     ##### 

  

    

other filings required (1) under any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or
competition laws (together with the HSR Filings, the " _Antitrust Filings_ ")
and (2) under any other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or
similar Law that the Company and Parent deem advisable or appropriate, in
each case, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and as promptly as practicable. The Antitrust Filings shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the Laws, as applicable. Subject to first
having used all reasonable efforts to negotiate a resolution of any
objections underlying such lawsuits or other legal proceedings, the Company
and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to defend and contest any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to
have any stay, temporary restraining order, or preliminary injunction entered
by any Governmental Entity vacated or reversed. 

   

 (b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, notifications and any other material actions pursuant to this Section 6.03, subject to applicable Law, by permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed material written communication to any Governmental Entity and by providing counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and submissions made by such party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Entity and any other information supplied by such party and such partys Affiliates to a Governmental Entity or received from such a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that material may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (y) as necessary to address good faith legal privilege or confidentiality concerns. Neither party shall file any such document or take such action if the other party has reasonably objected (and not withdrawn its objection) to the filing of such document or the taking of such action on the grounds that such filing or action would reasonably be expected to either (i) prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) cause a condition set forth in Article VII or Tender Offer Conditions to not be satisfied in a timely manner. Neither party shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other party. 

   

 (c) Each of the Company and Parent will promptly inform the other party upon receipt of any material communication from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company or Parent (or any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity that is related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. The parties agree not to participate, or to permit their Affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it so consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. Each party will advise the other party promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which the first party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other 

     ##### 

  

    

Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
will use all reasonable efforts to resolve any objections that may
be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Laws, including (subject
to first having used all reasonable efforts to negotiate a resolution to any
such objections) contesting and resisting any action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
have such statute, rule, regulation, decree, judgment, injunction or
other Order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including, without limitation, Section 6.03), no party is required to, and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the Company, Parent, or any of their Affiliates in any manner which, individually or in the aggregate with all other such requirements, conditions, understandings, agreements and Orders could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the combined business, financial condition or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the online advertising business of the online services business of Parent combined with the CSS Business of the Company after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will, upon the request of Parent, become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any of its Affiliates, so long as such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order is binding on the Company only in the event that the Closing occurs. Without the prior written consent of Parent (determined in its sole discretion), in no event shall the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates pay any consideration to, amend or enter into any agreement with, any non-governmental third party to obtain any consent to the Merger or to otherwise comply with Section 6.03(e). 

  

 (e) The Company and its Board of Directors shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.04 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation 

    ##### 

  

    

from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation, the Bylaws or any
indemnification Contract between such directors, officers, employees or
agents and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement), without further action, as of the Effective
Time and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of not less than
six years from the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.04 for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time. In the event (A) the Surviving Corporation transfers any material portion of its assets, in a single transaction or in a series of transactions, or (B) Parent takes any action to materially impair the financial ability of the Surviving Corporation to satisfy the obligations referred to in Section 6.04(a), Parent will either guarantee such obligations or take such other action to ensure that the ability of the Surviving Corporation, legal and financial, to satisfy such obligations will not be diminished in any material respect. 

   

 (c) Commencing at or prior to the Effective Time and until six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain (directly or indirectly through the Companys existing insurance programs) in effect directors and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries (a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent) on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts comparable to the insurance maintained currently by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to the beneficiaries of the current policies and with carriers having an A.M. Best "key rating" of A X or better, _provided_ that such substitution shall not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall first use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from such carriers a so-called "tail" policy providing such coverage and being effective for the full six year period referred to above, and shall be entitled to obtain such coverage in annual policies from such carriers only if it is unable, after exerting such efforts for a reasonable period of time, to obtain such a tail policy; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement as set forth in Section 6.04(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (or, in the case of a tail policy obtained pursuant to the preceding proviso, shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium therefor in excess of an amount equal to six times 300% of such last annual premium) and, if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.04(c), it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium (or an aggregate premium, as the case may be) equal to such maximum amount; and _provided_ , _further_ that Parent shall not 

    ##### 

  

    

acquire the insurance required by this Section 6.04(c) at or prior to the
Effective Time without the Companys prior consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.04: (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise. It is expressly agreed that the indemnified parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.04. 

   

 Section 6.05 _Fees_. 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.05, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement, if required, shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company. 

   

 (b) In the event that: 

    

 (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(f); or 

   

 (ii) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known, disclosed or proposed or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (and at such time the Antitrust Condition shall have been satisfied and none of the events set forth in clause (iii)(A) of _Annex II_ shall have occurred and be continuing) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and (C) within nine (9) months after such termination, the Company enters into, or submits to the stockholders of the Company for adoption, a definitive agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or consummates the transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ that, for purposes of this Section 6.05(b)(ii), all references to 15% in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be 50%) which in each case, need not be the same Takeover Proposal that shall have been publicly announced or made known at or prior to termination of this Agreement; 

 

then (in the case of the occurrence of any one or more of the events in
Sections 6.05(b)(i) and 6.05(b)(ii)) the Company shall pay Parent a one-time
Company Termination Fee (less any Expenses that may previously have been paid
or are payable in the circumstances as provided in Section 6.05(c) below), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds on the first Business Day
following (x) in the case of a payment required by Section 6.05(b)(i), the
date of termination of this Agreement, and (y) in the case of a payment
required by Section 6.05(b)(ii), the date of the consummation of such
Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company
Termination Fee_ " means an amount equal to $17,000,000. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c), then the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to Parents Expenses (not to exceed $3,500,000 in the aggregate) for which Parent has not theretofore been reimbursed by the Company, such payment to be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds following such termination within two Business Days following delivery to the Company of notice of demand for such payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Expenses_ " means, with respect to a party hereto, all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses, counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the sale process, including the authorization, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to (i) Section 8.01(b)(i) at a time when (A) the Antitrust Condition shall not have been satisfied or any of the events set forth in clause (iii)(A) of _Annex II_ shall have occurred and been continuing and (B) all of the other conditions set forth in _Annex II_ shall have been satisfied (other than the Minimum Tender Condition, which may but need not be satisfied), (ii) Section 8.01(b)(iii), or (iii) Section 8.01(d), then, without limitation as to any remedy the Company has pursuant to this Agreement, Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the $5,000,000 termination fee that the Company paid to QGF Acquisition Company Inc. under the Prior Agreement, such payment to be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds following such termination within two Business Days following delivery to Parent of notice of demand for such payment, it being agreed that such payment shall not be deemed to be liquidated damages. 

   

 (e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 6.05 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company and Parent would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if any party fails to pay when due the amount payable pursuant to this Section 6.05, and, in order to obtain such payment, the owed party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the owing party for the amounts set forth in this Section 6.05, the owing party shall pay to the owed party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on the terms set forth in this Section 6.05, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of receipt by the owed party of immediately available funds in such amount at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

   

 (f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 6.05 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Sub in the circumstances in which such termination fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. 

   

 Section 6.06 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to the announcement of any Change in Recommendation (or proposed Change in Recommendation) made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the express terms of Section 5.02 of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment 

    ##### 

  

    

upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent legally permissible: (i) each Company Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Acceptance Time; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, in the calendar year in which the Acceptance Time occurs Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents unless such conditions and requirements would not have been waived under the comparable Benefit Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year ending on the date such employees participation in the New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket requirements

applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

The provisions of this Section 6.08 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other Person shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan for any purpose.

party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally
available method. 

   

 Section 9.11 _Severability_.

 (B) (I) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.01(a), Section 4.01(b), Section 4.01(c) and Section 4.01(g)(ii)) shall not be true and correct (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect", "Material Adverse Change" and words of similar import set forth therein) as of the Acceptance Time as though such representations and warranties had been made at and as of such time (or, in the case of those representations and warranties that are made as of a particular date or period, at and as of such date or period), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, (II) each of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 4.01(a), 4.01(b) and 4.01(c) shall not be true and correct in all material respects as of the Acceptance Time as though each had been made at and as of the Acceptance Time (other than those of such representations and warranties that expressly relate to a particular date or period, in which case such particular representations shall have been true and correct in all respects as of such date or period; or (III) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.01(g)(ii) shall not be true and correct as of the Acceptance Time as though made as of the Acceptance Time; 

  

 (C) the Company shall not have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by the Company under this Agreement at or prior to the Acceptance Date other than those obligations for which Parent has provided a written waiver thereof; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (D) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; or 

  

 (E) immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall not have received a certificate on behalf of the Company signed by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company to the effect that none of the events set forth in clause (iii)(B) or clause (iii)(C) of this _Annex II_ have occurred and are continuing. 

  

 The foregoing conditions are for the benefit of Parent and Offeror and may be asserted by Parent or Offeror regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and other than the Minimum Tender Condition, may be waived by Parent or Offeror in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion, in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
