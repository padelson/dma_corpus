exercisable upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Section&nbsp;1.04, to purchase up to that
number of shares of Company Common Stock (the &#147;<U>Top-Up Option Shares</U>&#148;) equal to a number of
shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
directly or indirectly owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Offeror and its
Subsidiaries) at the time of such exercise, shall constitute the least amount required so that
Parent and Offeror own more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on a fully
diluted basis (as provided below) immediately after exercise of the Top-Up Option at a price per
share as set forth below; <I>provided </I>that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a
number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the Company&#146;s then authorized but unissued
shares of Company Common Stock. For purposes of percentage of ownership calculations with respect
to the Company under this Agreement, &#147;fully diluted basis&#148; assumes the conversion or exercise of
all derivative securities or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock regardless of the
conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof, other
than any shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option. The purchase price for the
Top-Up Option Shares shall be equal to the Offer Price, which price shall be payable either, at
Offeror&#146;s election, (A)&nbsp;entirely in cash or (B)&nbsp;in cash in an amount equal to the aggregate par
value of the purchased Top-Up Option Shares and by the issuance of a full recourse note with a
principal amount equal to the remainder of the exercise price.

of shares of Company Common Stock thereunder, be sufficient to allow the Short Form&nbsp;Merger to
occur), and prior to the earlier to occur of (i)&nbsp;the Effective Time and (ii)&nbsp;the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that the obligation of the Company
to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions
that (A)&nbsp;no Law or Order (each as defined in Section&nbsp;4.01(d)) shall prohibit the exercise of the
Top-Up Option or the delivery of all or a portion of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such
exercise, (B)&nbsp;no Governmental Entity or self-regulatory organization including any stock exchange
shall have threatened any action with respect thereto, (C)&nbsp;upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Offeror constitutes more than 90% of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be outstanding on a fully diluted basis
immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, and (D)&nbsp;Offeror has accepted for
payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn.
Without limiting the obligations set forth in Section&nbsp;6.03, if the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercised in whole or part by Offeror within five (5)&nbsp;Business Days of the Acceptance Time to the
extent necessary to allow the Short Form&nbsp;Merger to occur, the Offeror shall use its reasonable best
