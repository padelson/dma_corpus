amount that may be deducted under the terms of the WandI Insurance from any Loss

entitled to make any claims against Seller

excess of the one euro (EUR 1) financial limit in Section 10.2.1(c).

exceeds four million five hundred thousand euro (EUR 4,500,000) (the Loss
Threshold). In such case, subject to Sections 10.2.1(b) and 10.2.1(d), Seller

or (B) required by any enactment of Law or any change of Law or the published
practice of any Tax or other Governmental Entity in each case not in force at
the date of this Agreement or which takes effect retroactively; or (C) taken
under the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction Document; or (D) carried
out by any Group Company pursuant to or by reason of a legally binding
commitment or a legal requirement that existed on or before Closing;  

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

is actually recovered by Buyer or its Affiliates under a third-party insurance
policy in force (and Buyer and its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable endeavours to recover under the same, it being understood that this
limitation shall be calculated net of any deductibles, retentions or fees or
expenses of recovery, including retroactive premium adjustments); 

---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

has been included as Permitted Leakage; 

---|---|--- 
 



Page | 42 is (or the matter giving rise to such Loss is) specifically provided for
(whether by way of allowance, provision or reserve) in the Locked Box
Accounts or otherwise reduced the net assets in the Locked Box Accounts; 

---|---|--- 



     | (vi) |

has been reimbursed or otherwise paid in cash to Buyer or its Affiliates by a
third party (where such sum would not have been received by Buyer but for the
circumstances giving rise to that Management Warranty Claim), provided that
where Buyer recovers such an amount from a third party, the amount of the
Management Warranty Claim shall be reduced to the extent of the amount
recovered (less all costs, charges and expenses reasonably and properly
incurred by Buyer in making such recovery) or extinguished if the amount
recovered (less such costs, charges and expenses) exceeds the amount of the
Management Warranty Claim; it being understood that if Buyer or its Affiliate
has actually received compensation for such Loss from Seller pursuant to this
Agreement (the "Damages Payment"), and thereafter receives compensation for
the same Loss from a third party, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller an
amount equal to such compensation received from the third party (net of tax on
that amount and all costs, charges and expenses reasonably and properly
incurred by Buyer in making such recovery) or, if less, the Damages Payment. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

No liability shall arise in respect of any Management Warranty Claim and Buyer
shall not be entitled to compensation hereunder in respect of any Loss for a
Management Warranty Claim to the extent that Buyer had actual knowledge as at
the date of this Agreement (i) of the fact, matter, event or circumstance
giving rise to such Loss and (ii) that the Loss arising from such fact,
matter, event or circumstance gave rise to a Management Warranty Claim. For
the purposes of this Section 10.2.3(b), the "actual knowledge of Buyer" shall
mean the actual knowledge of (but only of) Prith Gandhi, Greg LaMastus and
Alison Nudd, and no other knowledge or awareness of Buyer or its employees,
officers, agents or advisers (whether actual or constructive) shall be imputed
to Buyer for the purposes of this Section 10.2.3(b).  

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

No liability shall arise in respect of any Management Warranty Claim to the
extent that the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to such
Management Warranty Claim has been Fairly Disclosed, but provided that, for
the avoidance of doubt, any matter Fairly Disclosed in the Supplementary
Disclosure Letter which relates to a fact, matter, event or circumstance
existing on or prior to the date of this Agreement shall not qualify the
Warranties given on the date of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

No liability shall arise in respect of any Management Warranty Claim and Buyer
shall not be entitled to compensation hereunder in respect of any Loss for a
Management Warranty Claim if and to the extent such Loss is contingent and not
an actual liability that is due and payable provided, however, that this does
not prevent Buyer from making such claim with respect to contingent Loss
within the time periods set forth in Section 10.2.2 and to finalise such claim
when such contingent Loss ceases to be contingent. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

No member of the Buyer Group shall be entitled to recover damages or obtain
payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in respect of
any one liability, Loss, shortfall, deficiency, breach or other set of
circumstances which gives rise to more than one claim insofar that such a
recovery, payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity would result in a
duplicative recovery for the Buyer Group, and for this purpose recovery by any
member of the Buyer Group shall be deemed to be a recovery by each of them. 

---|---|--- 
 



Page | 43 Buyer shall (and shall procure that each member of the Buyer Group shall), in
respect of each Management Warranty Claim, take all reasonable steps to avoid
or mitigate any Loss or damage which it may suffer in consequence of any
breach by Warrantor of any of the Management Warranties. 

---|---|--- 
 



   10.3 |

Limitations on Tax Warranty Claims 

---|--- 
 

No liability shall arise in respect of any Tax Warranty Claim and Buyer shall
not be entitled to compensation hereunder in respect of any Loss under a Tax
Warranty Claim, if and to the extent that:



     | (a) |

the Tax Liability arises as a result of any Group Company failing to submit
the returns and computations required to be made by it or not submitting such
returns and computations within the appropriate time limits or submitting such
returns and computations otherwise than on a proper basis, in each case after
Closing; or 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

any Relief (other than a Relief referred to in paragraph or of Schedule 1.104)
of any Group Company has reduced or eliminated the Tax Liability; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

the Tax Liability would not have arisen but for: 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

the making of a claim, election, surrender or disclaimer, the giving of a
notice or consent, or the doing of any other thing under the provisions of
any enactment or regulation relating to Tax, in each case after Closing and by
Buyer, any Group Company or any person connected with any of them other than
in the ordinary course of business of any Group Company as carried on at
Closing or where the making, giving or doing of which was taken into account
in the preparation of the Locked Box Accounts.; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the failure or omission on the part of any Group Company after Closing to make
any such valid claim, election, surrender or disclaimer, or to give any such
notice or consent or to do any other such thing in circumstances where the
making, giving or doing of which was taken into account in the preparation of
the Locked Box Accounts and in circumstances where any action required to be
taken by Buyer is provided in writing to Buyer (including in the Disclosure
Letter) on or before Closing; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

the Tax Liability is a liability to Tax comprising interest, penalties,
charges or costs in so far as attributable to the unreasonable delay or
default of Buyer or any Group Company after Closing; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

the Tax Liability arises as a result of circumstances giving rise to a breach
of Tax Warranty 23 due to the failure of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller or
another Warrantor to make a payment of Tax. 

---|---|--- 



   10.4 |

Notice of Loss 

---|--- 



     | (a) |

Where notice is given pursuant to Section 10.2.2 in respect of any Warranty
Claim or Tax Indemnity Claim, such notice shall contain (to the extent then
available to Buyer) such reasonable information regarding the nature and value
of such claim. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Any Warranty Claim shall (if it has not been previously satisfied, settled or
withdrawn) be deemed to have been withdrawn six (6) months after the notice
is given pursuant to 

---|---|--- 
 



Page | 44  Section 10.2.2 unless legal proceedings in respect of it have been commenced
by being both issued and served except where such claim relates to a
contingent liability in which case it shall be deemed to have been withdrawn
unless legal proceedings in respect of it have been commenced by being both
issued and served within six (6) months of it having become an actual
liability. No new claim may be made in respect of the facts, matters, events
or circumstances giving rise to any such withdrawn claim. 

---|--- 



   11. |

(ii) disclose any Confidential Information to any person other than its
Affiliates or Representatives or (iii) use any Technical Confidential
Information or (iv) disclose any Technical Confidential Information to any
person other than its Affiliates or Representatives, provided always that

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

---|---|--- 



     | (v) |

required for Buyer to claim compensation or enforce its rights towards the

---|---|--- 



     | (vi) |

made by Seller to CVC Capital Partners Limited, a CVC Person or their

including those persons whom Seller, CVC Capital Partners Limited, a CVC
Person or its or

Page | 45  their affiliates reasonably believe are likely to become direct or indirect
investors, together with their and their investors Representatives; or 

---|--- 
 



     | (vii) |

made with the prior written consent of Seller (in relation to a disclosure by
Buyer or their Affiliate or Representative) or Buyer (in relation to a
disclosure by Seller or their Affiliate or Representative). 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

All press releases and other public relations activities of the Parties in
relation to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder are
subject to mutual prior approval of Seller and Buyer (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) provided, however, that this
restriction shall not apply to the extent that the press release or public
announcement is required by Law, by any stock exchange or any regulatory or
other supervisory body, Governmental Entity, or other authority of competent
jurisdiction. The Party required to issue any press release or announcement
shall, to the extent permissible and reasonably practicable, allow the other
Parties reasonable time to comment thereon in advance of such issuance. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) |

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the obligations under the

following the Closing Date. 

---|---|--- 



   12.2 |

Retiring Directors 

---|--- 



     | (a) |

Buyer undertakes: (i) to procure that, from and after Closing, any person who
was at any time prior to Closing an employee, consultant, officer or director
of any Group Company (a Covered Person) who have resigned or have been
replaced in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, are
granted discharge (to the fullest extent permitted in accordance with
applicable laws) from liability for their management and administration until
(and including) the Closing Date or the earlier date of their resignation
(other than in respect of a Covered Persons fraud or wilful misconduct); and
(ii) to waive, release and discharge each Covered Person from any and all
claims, demands, proceedings, causes of action, orders, obligations and
liabilities arising out of any matter, cause or event occurring on or before
Closing (other than in respect of a Covered Persons fraud or wilful
misconduct) (a Pre-Closing Event) which each Group Company has or may at any
time have had against any Covered Person. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

To the extent that the memorandum and articles of association (or similar
constitutional documents) of a Group Company of which a Covered Person was an
employee, officer or director contains any indemnity and/or immunity
provisions in favor of a Covered Person immediately prior to Closing, Buyer
shall ensure that such provisions are not amended, repealed or
modified following Closing in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights of any such Covered Person in respect of Pre-Closing Events. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

For six years from Closing, Buyer shall ensure that each Group Company
maintains in force such "run-off" directors and officers liability insurance
policies as will enable each Covered Person to make claims arising out of any
Pre-Closing Event under those policies on terms and conditions that are not
materially disadvantageous to the Covered Person than the directors and
officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Group Companies as at
the date of this Agreement.  

---|---|--- 
 



Page | 46 Furthermore, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, and shall cause that the
Group Companies do not, directly or indirectly, make any claims or demands
against such Covered Persons or commence, institute or cause to be commenced,
any proceedings of any kind relating to any Pre-Closing Event against any
Covered Person and shall hold each of them harmless against any such claims,
save for situations where such individual is guilty of fraud or wilful
misconduct. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

The provisions of this Section 12.2 are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any Covered Person may have at law, by contract or otherwise. 

---|---|---

     | (c) |

Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. Each Party confirms that:

 



     | (i) |

it has not entered into this Agreement or any Transaction Document on the

which is not expressly incorporated in this Agreement and the Transaction

---|---|---

Transaction Document, no Party (or any of its Connected Persons) shall owe
any duty of care or have any liability in tort or otherwise to the other
parties (or their respective Connected Persons) in relation to the
Transaction, 

---|---|--- 
 

provided that this Section 14.5 shall not exclude any liability for (or remedy
in respect of) fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation.

its or their officers, employees, agents and advisers.



   14.6 |

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

The Connected Persons specified in Section 14.5 shall have the right to
enforce the relevant terms of that Section and this Section 14.6, and the
Covered Persons shall have the right to enforce the terms of Section 12.2 and
this Section 14.6, by reason of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act
1999. This right is subject to: (i) the rights of the parties to amend or
vary this Agreement without the consent of any Connected Person or Covered
Person; and (ii) the other terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

   14.7 |

Interpretation 

---|--- 



     | (a) |

The fact that a Party has drafted or participated in drafting this Agreement
or any provisions hereof does not in any way affect the interpretation of
this Agreement to the disadvantage of such Party. 

---|---|--- 
 



Page | 50 The headings and the table of contents of this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only and do not in any way limit or affect the meaning or
interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



   14.8 | Amendments and Waivers 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

Any amendment to or waiver of this Agreement is to be made in writing and will

Parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party waiving compliance with this
Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Failure by any Party at any time to require performance of any provisions of
this Agreement does not in any manner affect its right to enforce the same,
and the waiver by any Party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement
is not to be construed to be a waiver by such Party of any succeeding breach
of such provision or waiver by such Party of any breach of any other
provision hereof. 

---|---|--- 



   14.9 | Severability 
---|--- 

If any provision of this Agreement is declared to be invalid
or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be
affected thereby but will remain in full force and effect and binding upon the
Parties. Without limiting the aforesaid, the Parties shall attempt through
negotiations in good faith to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision
with a provision closest to the mutually intended meaning of such provision
and the spirit of this Agreement. The failure of the Parties to reach an
agreement on a replacement provision does not affect the validity of the
remaining part of this Agreement.



   14.10 | No Set-Off 
---|--- 

Unless expressly stated otherwise, all payments made by Buyer under this
agreement, or any of the documents referred to in it, shall be made free from

without the other Parties consent:

assign its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates and
designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder,
in which case Buyer shall remain responsible for the performance of its
obligations hereunder; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

assign its rights and interests hereunder to or charge by way of security to
