liability that otherwise may be required to be recorded pursuant to Financial
Accounting Standard 133, as it relates to derivatives, shall not be
included)); and (ii) the computation of the Adjustment Amount and Purchase
Price, together with all information used by Purchaser in making
such computation (items (i) and (ii) collectively and as adjusted pursuant

30 days after delivery of the Closing Adjustment Documents to the Seller, the

Purchaser disputes all or any portion of the Notice of Disagreement within
the 15-day period described in the previous sentence, and within 15 days
following the delivery to the Seller of the notice of such dispute the
Purchaser and the Seller do not resolve the Disagreement (as evidenced by a
written agreement between the Purchaser and the Seller), such Disagreement
shall be referred to an independent accounting firm mutually selected by the
Purchaser and the Seller for a resolution of such Disagreement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. The independent accounting firm shall
render its determination within 30 days and such determination with respect
to any Disagreement shall be final and binding upon the parties, and
the amount so determined shall be used to complete the final Closing
Adjustment Documents. The Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate with such
firm and provide such firm with access to their books, records, personnel and
representatives and those of their Subsidiaries and such other information as
such firm may require in order to render its determination. All of the fees
and expenses of any independent accounting firm retained pursuant to this
paragraph (c) shall be paid one-half by the Purchaser and one-half by
Sellers.   (d) In order to facilitate the prompt resolution of
the procedures contemplated by this Section 2.04, shortly prior to the
Closing Date the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with a preliminary draft
of the Closing Date Balance Sheet.   (e) Within three (3) Business Days of
the final determination of the Adjustment Amount in accordance with this
Section 2.04 or, if the Seller has given a Notice of Disagreement, within
three (3) Business Days after the Closing Adjustment Documents become final
and binding on the parties pursuant to Section 2.04(c):   (i) If the
Adjustment Amount shown in the final Closing  Adjustment Documents is
positive, then the Purchaser shall pay to the  Seller such Adjustment Amount,
by wire transfer to an account  identified to the Purchaser in writing;
and     (ii) If such Adjustment Amount is negative, then the  Sellers,
jointly and severally, shall pay to the Purchaser such  Adjustment Amount, by
wire transfer to an account identified to the  Seller in writing,  in
either case together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to
the prime commercial lending rate announced from time to time by RBC Centura

the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 ("ERISA"), and incentive and bonus, deferred compensation, stock
purchase, restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation rights or stock
based plan) (collectively, the "Company Compensation and Benefit Plans") is
listed in Paragraph 3.13 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule and each Company
Compensation and Benefit Plan that has received a favorable opinion letter
from the Internal Revenue Service National Office, including any master or

any trust agreement, insurance contract and, with respect to any employee
stock ownership plan, loan agreement, forming a part of any Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans, and all amendments thereto, have been made
available to the Purchaser.   (b) All Company Compensation and Benefit
Plans, other than "multi-employer plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37)
of ERISA (each, a "Multiemployer Plan"), are in substantial compliance with
ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws. Each Company Compensation and
Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA (the "ERISA Plans") that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
(a "Company Pension Plan") and that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (other than the Company\'s 401(k) Plan) has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all tax law changes
prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has
applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the
applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and
neither the Company nor any of    the Sellers is aware of any
circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code. Any voluntary employees\' beneficiary
association within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code that provides
benefits under a Company. Compensation and Benefit Plan has (i) received an
opinion letter from the IRS recognizing its exempt status under Section
501(c)(9) of the Code and (ii) filed a timely notice with the IRS pursuant to
Section 505(c) of the Code, and neither the Company nor any of the Sellers is
aware of circumstances likely to result in the loss of such exempt status
under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. There is no pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company or any of the Sellers, threatened material litigation relating
to the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan
that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired, could subject
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or penalty imposed
by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects
to incur a material tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA.   (c) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV
of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-
employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently
or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any
entity that is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of
ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal
liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV
of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA
Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section
4043 of ERISA for which the 30 day reporting requirement has not been waived
or extended, other than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Reg.
Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Company Pension Plan
or by any ERISA Affiliate since July 1, 2002.   (d) All contributions
required to be made under the terms of any Company Compensation and Benefit
Plan have been timely made or have been reflected on the Balance Sheet.
Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA
Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived)
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no
ERISA Affiliate of the Company has an outstanding funding waiver. It is not
reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to
any    Company Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be
materially increased by application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to
provide, security to any Company Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan
of an ERISA Affiliate of the Company pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the
Code.   (e) Under each Company Pension Plan that is a single-employer plan,
as of the last day of the most recent plan year, the actuarially determined
present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
contained in the Company Pension Plan\'s most recent actuarial valuation),
did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Company Pension
Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial condition of
such Company Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan
year.   (f) The Company\'s 401(k) Plan is identical (except for sponsor
identifying information) to the First Mercantile Trust Company plan that has
received a favorable IRS opinion letter dated August 7, 2001, a copy of which
has been provided to the Purchaser (the "First Mercantile Opinion Letter"),
and the Company has chosen only the options permitted by that plan. The
Company has followed the terms of the plan and is entitled to rely on
the First Mercantile Opinion Letter for the purposes of qualification.  
(g) Except as required by Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have any obligations
for retiree health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan except as set forth
in Paragraph 3.13(g) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule. The Company or its
Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan under the terms of such
plan at any time without incurring any material liability thereunder other
than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination.  
(h) Except as set forth in Paragraph 3.13(h) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, there has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the
expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Except as
set forth in Paragraph 3.13(h) of Sellers Disclosure Schedule, neither the
execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement nor the
consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (v) entitle
any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance pay or
any    increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after
the date hereof, (w) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in
any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any other

Plans, (x) limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Purchaser, to merge, amend or terminate any of the
Company Compensation and Benefit Plans, or (y) cause the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Purchaser, to record additional compensation expense
on its income statement with respect to any outstanding stock option or other
equity-based award.   (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liability or obligation with respect to any plan, agreement or
arrangement of the Company or any of its Affiliates providing equity-based
awards to Employees or current or former directors, consultants or
independent contractors of the Company.   SECTION 3.14 Labor Matters. Each

Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, any such laws respecting
employment discrimination, disability rights or benefits, equal opportunity,
affirmative action, workers\' compensation, employee benefits, severance
payments, labor relations, employee leave issues, wage and hour standards,
occupational safety and health requirements and unemployment insurance and
related matters. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or is bound by any collective bargaining Contract with a labor union or
labor organization, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject
of a proceeding asserting that the Company or any such Subsidiary has
committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor

threatened, nor are any of the Sellers or the Company aware of any activity

potentially deemed branches of any insured depository  institution parent of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.   (d) Application of Funds. All monies
received with  respect to each Mortgage Loan have been properly accounted for
and  applied.   (e) Loan Disbursement. At closing, all of the Mortgage 
Loans were fully disbursed in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.   (f) Payoff Statements. All payoff and assumption  statements
with respect to each Mortgage Loan were, at the time  provided, complete and
accurate in all material respects.   (g) Escrow Accounts. Unless otherwise
prohibited by law  or an executed escrow waiver, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries  has collected all escrows related to the Mortgage Loans, and
all escrow  accounts have been maintained by the Company and each of its 
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, to the Sellers\' and the Company\'s 
knowledge, all Prior Servicers in accordance, in all material respects,  with
all applicable laws, rules, regulations and requirements of  Investors,
insurers and     Governmental Entities (including without limitation the
Federal  government, states and subdivisions thereof), and in accordance
with  the applicable Mortgage Servicing Agreements. The Company and each of 
its Subsidiaries has credited to the account of mortgagors all interest 
required to be paid on any escrow account in accordance with applicable  law
and the terms of such agreements and loan documents.   (h) Single Family
Loans. All of the Mortgage Loans were  secured by one-to-four-family
residential real property or, to the  extent that a Mortgage Loan was secured
by property other than a  one-to-four-family residential property, such
Mortgage Loan was not a  Warehouse Loan and has not been sold to any Person
where the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries could have any recourse
obligation.   (i) ARM Adjustments. With respect to each Mortgage Loan  for
which the interest rate was not fixed for the term of the loan, the  Company
and each of its Subsidiaries has, since the date it commenced  servicing such
loan and, to the best of the Sellers\' and the Company\'s  knowledge, all
Prior Servicers have (i) properly and accurately entered  into its system all
data required to service such Mortgage Loan in  accordance with all
applicable laws and regulations, (ii) properly and  accurately adjusted the
interest rate on each interest adjustment date,  (iii) properly and
accurately adjusted the monthly payment on each  payment adjustment date,

laws, rules and regulations and  the terms of the related mortgage documents
regarding the interest rate  and payment adjustments.   (j) Pools. None of
the Mortgage Loans is or has been  included by Sellers, the Company or any of
the Affiliates of either in,  any pool or securitization. Neither the Company
nor any of its  Subsidiaries has sponsored or established any special purpose
vehicle  or entity that would be required to be consolidated with the Company
or  a Company Subsidiary pursuant to Interpretation No. 46 of the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board.   (k) Mortgage Insurance. Except as set forth in
Paragraph  3.17(k) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, each Mortgage Loan
that is  required to be covered by FHA insurance is insured under the
National  Housing Act or qualifies for insurance thereunder and    
timely and proper application has been made for such insurance. Each 
Mortgage Loan that is required to be guaranteed by the VA is guaranteed 
under the provisions of Chapter 37 of Title 38 of the United States  Code or
qualifies for such guarantee and timely and proper application  has been made
for such guarantee. As to each FHA insurance certificate,  each VA guarantee
certificate, and each Mortgage Loan that is required  to be insured by
private mortgage insurance, the Company and each of  its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, has complied with applicable  provisions of the insurance or
guarantee contract and Federal statutes  and regulations.   (l) Taxes and
Insurance. Each Mortgage Loan has been  covered by a policy of hazard
insurance and flood insurance, to the  extent required by the Mortgage
Servicing Agreements or loan purchase  agreement relating thereto or any
laws, rules, regulations or investor  or insurer requirements applicable to
such Mortgage Loan, all in a form  usual and customary in the industry, and
all amounts due and payable  under each policy have been paid prior to the
date such payments were  due; and all Taxes, assessments, ground rents or
other applicable  charges or fees due and payable as to each Mortgage Loan
have been paid  prior to the date such payments were due. Any and all claims
under such  insurance policies have been submitted and processed in
accordance with  the applicable Investor\'s requirements.   (m) Title
Insurance. To the extent required by the  applicable Investor, each Mortgage
Loan was covered by an American Land  Title Association lender\'s title
insurance policy or other generally  acceptable form of policy of insurance
acceptable to the relevant  Investor, and each such title insurance policy
was issued by a title  insurer acceptable to the applicable Investor and
qualified to do  business in the jurisdiction where the collateral securing
such loan  was located, and insured the originator and its successors and
assigns  as to the first priority lien of the mortgage in the original
principal  amount of the Mortgage Loan. The applicable Investor, as assignee
of  the originator\'s rights, is an insured of such lender\'s title
insurance  policy, and such lender\'s policy is in full force and effect.
Neither  the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the best of the
Sellers\'  or the Company\'s knowledge, any Prior Servicer has performed any
act or  omission that would impair the coverage of such lender\'s policy.  
(n) Audits and Inquiries. Paragraph 3.17(n) of the  Sellers Disclosure
Schedule contains a true and correct list of all of  the audits,
investigations, complaints and inquiries of the Company     and each of
its Subsidiaries by an Agency, a Governmental Entity, an  Investor, or a
private mortgage insurer commenced since January 1,  2000, Except for
customary ongoing quality control reviews and except  as disclosed in

by the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries,   (iii) indemnification by the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries in connection with Mortgage Loans,  
(iv) rescission of any insurance or guaranty  contract or agreement,   (v)
payment of a penalty to any Agency, an  Investor or a private mortgage

its Subsidiaries issues or has issued mortgage backed  securities. The
Company\'s Servicing Business is limited to FNMA  servicing.   SECTION 3.18
Transactions with Affiliates. Except as set forth in Paragraph 3.18 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, all transactions between or among (i) the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) any of their respective
Affiliates or any Company Related Person have been conducted on terms and
conditions substantially the same, or no less favorable to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as comparable transactions with a Person that is not
an Affiliate of the Company or its Subsidiaries or that would be offered to
such a Person for such a comparable transaction. All Contracts and material
business arrangements and transactions that have occurred or existed since
January 1, 1998, including a description of the nature of the
services    provided and the charge therefor if not provided pursuant to a
written Contract between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and

assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries that relate solely, and all
liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries that relate, to its business
as a servicer or master servicer of mortgage loans for the account of others.
The Servicing Business Agreement and the Subservicing Agreement provide to
the fullest extent permitted by law for no liability or recourse for damages
against Purchaser or its Affiliates, including after the Closing the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries, in any way. The Servicing Business Agreement
and the Subservicing Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.19(a) and
3.19(b) respectively.   SECTION 3.20 Disclosure. No representation or
warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement, or the exhibits and
schedules hereto, or in any certificate delivered to the Purchaser in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
contains or will contain any untrue statement of material fact. To the
Company\'s and the Sellers\' knowledge, none of the documents furnished to
the Purchaser in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby contains any untrue statement of material fact in light
of the circumstances under which such documents have been furnished.  
SECTION 3.21 Intellectual Property.   (a) Schedule 3.21(a) sets forth a true
and complete list of all (i) material and/or Registered Intellectual Property
owned by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, indicating for each
Registered item the registration or application number and the applicable
filing jurisdiction (collectively, the "Scheduled Intellectual Property") and
(ii) Intellectual Property Contracts (other than commercial "off-the-shelf"
or "shrink-wrap" software). The Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable,
exclusively owns (beneficially and of record where applicable) all Scheduled
Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
Permitted Encumbrances. The Scheduled Intellectual Property is valid,
subsisting and enforceable, and is not subject to any    outstanding
order, judgment, decree or agreement adversely affecting the Company\'s or
its Subsidiaries\' use thereof or its rights thereto. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has sufficient rights to use all Intellectual Property used
in its business as currently conducted and to be used in its business as
proposed to be conducted, all of which rights shall survive unchanged the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There is no
litigation, opposition, cancellation, proceeding, objection or claim pending,
asserted or threatened concerning the ownership, validity, registerability,
enforceability, infringement, use or licensed right to use any Intellectual
Property as concerns the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Scheduled
Intellectual Property or Licensed Intellectual Property. To the Company\'s or
the Sellers\' knowledge, no valid basis for any such litigation, opposition,
cancellation, proceeding, objection or claim exists. To the Company\'s or the
Sellers\' knowledge, no Person is violating any Scheduled Intellectual
Property right or other Intellectual Property right that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries holds exclusively.   (b) The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has taken all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy,
confidentiality and value of all Trade Secrets that are owned, used or held
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and to the Company\'s and the
Sellers\' knowledge, such Trade Secrets have not been used, disclosed to or
discovered by any Person except pursuant to valid and appropriate non-
disclosure and/or license agreements and those agreements have not been
breached. To the Company\'s and the Sellers\' knowledge, none of the
Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' current employees has any patents
issued or applications pending for any device, process, design or invention
of any kind now used or needed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
the furtherance of its business, which patents or applications have not been
assigned to the Company or its Subsidiaries. To the Company\'s and the
Sellers\' knowledge, the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
employees\' performance of their employment activities does not violate any
third party\'s Intellectual Property rights or any such employee\'s
contractual obligations to any third person.   (c) Each Intellectual
Property Contract is legal, valid, binding and enforceable against the other
party, and is in full force and effect, subject to applicable bankruptcy and
insolvency laws and general principles of equity, and will continue to be so
immediately following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. No claim has been threatened or asserted that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Company\'s or the Sellers\' knowledge
another Person, has breached any Intellectual Property Contract. There exists
no event, condition or occurrence that, with the giving of notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a breach or default by the Company
or    any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Company\'s or the Sellers\'
knowledge, another Person under any Intellectual Property Contract. No party
to any Intellectual Property Contract has given the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries notice of its intention to cancel, terminate, change the scope
of rights under, or fail to renew any Intellectual Property Contract. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the Company\'s or the
Sellers\' knowledge any other party to any Intellectual Property Contract,
has repudiated in writing any material provision thereof. To the extent that
Licensed Intellectual Property is sublicensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by a third Person, the Company\'s or its Subsidiary\'s
sublicensed rights shall continue in full force and effect even if the
principal third Person license terminates for any reason. Consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not place the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in breach or default of any Intellectual Property
Contract, or trigger any modification, termination or
acceleration thereunder, or effect any license under or Encumbrance on
Intellectual Property owned or held by the Purchaser immediately prior to the
Closing Date. To the Company\'s and the Sellers\' knowledge, the Licensed
Intellectual Property is valid, subsisting and enforceable and is not subject
to any outstanding order, judgment, decree or agreement adversely affecting
the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries use thereof or its rights
thereto.   (d) The IT Assets operate and perform in all material respects
in accordance with their documentation and functional specifications and
otherwise as required by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
in connection with its business, and have not materially malfunctioned or
failed within the past three (3) years. To the knowledge of Sellers and the
Company, the IT Assets do not contain any "time bombs," "Trojan horses,"
"back doors," "trap doors," "worms," viruses, bugs, faults or other devices
or effects that (A) enable or assist any Person to access without
authorization the IT Assets, or (B) otherwise significantly adversely affect
the functionality of the IT Assets, except as disclosed in its documentation.
To the Company\'s and the Sellers\' knowledge, no Person has gained
unauthorized access to the IT Assets. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has implemented reasonable backup and disaster recover
technology consistent with industry practices. To the Company\'s and the
Sellers\' knowledge, none of the IT Assets contains any shareware,
open source code, or other software the use of which requires disclosure or
licensing of Intellectual Property.   SECTION 3.22 Books and Records. The
books and records of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been
properly and accurately maintained, and there are no material inaccuracies or
discrepancies contained or reflected therein.     SECTION 3.23 Accounting
Controls. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has devised and
maintained systems of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances, in the judgment of the Sellers, that (i) all material
transactions are executed in accordance with management\'s general or
specific authorization; (ii) all material transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP consistently applied with respect to any criteria applicable to
such statements, (iii) access to the material property and assets of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is permitted only in accordance
with management\'s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the
recorded accountability for items is compared with the actual levels at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.   SECTION 3.24 Insurance Issued by the Insurance
Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Paragraph 3.24 of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule:   (a) All benefits claimed by any Person under any insurance
Contract issued by any Insurance Subsidiary have in all material respects
been paid (or provision for payment thereof has been made) in accordance with
the terms of the Contracts under which they arose, such payments were not
materially delinquent and were paid (or will be paid) without fines
or penalties; and   (b) the underwriting standards utilized and
ratings applied by each Insurance Subsidiary with respect to insurance
Contracts outstanding as of the date hereof have been previously disclosed to
the Purchaser and conform in all material respects to industry accepted
practices and, with respect to any such Contract reinsured in whole or in
part, conform in all material respects to the standards and ratings required
pursuant to the terms of the related reinsurance, coinsurance or other
similar Contracts.   SECTION 3.25 Reinsurance and Coinsurance. Paragraph
3.25 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of
all reinsurance or coinsurance treaties or agreements, including
retrocessional agreements, to which the Insurance Subsidiary is a party or
under which the Insurance Subsidiary has any existing rights, obligations or
liabilities. All such treaties or agreements as set forth in such Paragraph
3.25 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule are in full force and effect. Except
as set forth in Paragraph 3.25 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, to the
knowledge of Sellers and the Company, no party to a reinsurance or
coinsurance treaty or agreement to which the Insurance Subsidiary is a party
is in default in any material respect as to   any provision thereof, and
no such agreement contains any provision providing that the other party
thereto may terminate such agreement by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in Paragraph 3.25 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of Sellers and the Company,
there is no reason to believe that the financial condition of any other party
to any such agreement is impaired such that a default thereunder
may reasonably be anticipated, whether or not such default may be cured by
the operation of any offset clause in such agreement, and all amounts
recoverable under reinsurance, coinsurance or other similar Contracts to
which the Insurance Subsidiary is a party (including, but not limited to,
amounts based on paid and unpaid losses) are fully collectible. The Insurance
Subsidiary is entitled to take full credit in its Statutory Statements
pursuant to applicable laws for all reinsurance and coinsurance ceded
pursuant to any reinsurance or coinsurance treaty or agreement to which such
Insurance Subsidiary is party. Except as set forth in Paragraph 3.25 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, no insurer or reinsurer or group of affiliated
insurers or reinsurers accounted for the direction to the Insurance
Subsidiary or the ceding by the Insurance Subsidiary of insurance or
reinsurance business in an aggregate amount equal to two percent or more of
the consolidated gross premium income of the Insurance Subsidiary for the
year ended December 31, 2002.   SECTION 3.26 Security Deposits. Paragraph
3.26 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list
of all securities and amounts deposited by the Insurance Subsidiary with
state insurance departments and other Governmental Entities.   SECTION 3.27
Certain Policies. Paragraph 3.27 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule sets

written by or ceded to the Insurance Subsidiary with respect to any insured
currently or formerly involved in the manufacture, processing or distribution
of asbestos, tobacco, biomedical or other products, or to the knowledge of
Sellers or the Company, in research, development or providing technical
advice or information with respect to the manufacture of any such products,
including the name of the insured, the policy period and the policy limits.
No notices have been received by any of the Sellers, the Company or the
Insurance Subsidiary of claims made by the insured under any of
such policies. Except as set forth in Paragraph 3.27 of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, each such policy for each insured contains a product
liability exclusion, in the form set forth on Paragraph 3.27 of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, for each policy year.   SECTION 3.28 Actuarial
Reports. The Sellers or the Company have delivered to the Purchaser a true
and complete copy of    any actuarial reports prepared by actuaries,
independent or otherwise, with respect to the Insurance Subsidiary in the
last twelve (12 months], and all attachments, addenda, supplements and
modifications thereto (the "Company Actuarial Analyses"). To the knowledge of
Sellers and the Company, the information and data furnished by the Company or
the Insurance Subsidiary to its independent actuaries in connection with the
preparation of the Company Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all material
respects. Furthermore, each Company Actuarial Analysis was based upon an
accurate inventory of policies and contracts in force for the Insurance
Subsidiary at the relevant time of preparation, was prepared using
appropriate modeling procedures accurately applied and in conformity with
generally accepted actuarial standards consistently applied, and the
projections contained therein were properly prepared in accordance with the
assumptions stated therein.   SECTION 3.29 Reserves. The reserves for
payment of benefits, losses, claims, expenses and similar purposes (including
claims litigation) under all presently issued insurance policies and
reinsurance contracts and other material liabilities of the Insurance
Subsidiary reflected in, or included with, the Statutory Statements or the
Company Financial Statements were determined in accordance with presently
accepted prudent industry standards consistently applied, are computed on the
basis of generally accepted actuarial standards consistently applied
throughout the specified period and the immediately prior period, actuarial
assumptions that were in accordance with or more conservative than those
called for in relevant policy and contract provisions, are fairly stated in
accordance with sound actuarial and statutory accounting principles and are
in compliance with the requirements of applicable laws. Such reserves and
liabilities were adequate in the aggregate to cover the total amount of all
reasonably anticipated liabilities of the Insurance Subsidiary under all
outstanding insurance, reinsurance and other applicable agreements as of the
respective dates of such Statutory Statements and Company Financial
Statements. The admitted assets of the Insurance Subsidiary as determined
under applicable laws are in an amount at least equal to the minimum amounts
required by applicable laws. In addition, Sellers or the Company
have delivered to the Purchaser copies of all work papers used as the basis
for establishing the reserves for the Insurance Subsidiary at December 31,
2002.   SECTION 3.30 Risk-Based Capital; Insurance Regulatory Information

ratios.     SECTION 3.31 Retentions. Paragraph 3.31 of the

such arrangements may be terminated at Purchaser\'s option on the Closing
Date without the payment of a penalty.   SECTION 3.33 Employment Agreements.
Except as disclosed in Paragraph 3.33 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedules,
none of the Sellers has any employment, consulting or other agreements with
any directors, officers, employees or consultants of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. The board of directors of the Company has unanimously
approved the execution and delivery by the Company of the Employment
Agreements, and such approval satisfies the requirement of the Company\'s
Bylaws for unanimous board of directors\' approval of any amendment to any
employment agreements between the Company and the Executives.   SECTION
3.34 Risk Management Instruments. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,
option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar risk
management arrangements, whether entered into for the Company\'s own account,
or for the account of one or more of the Company Subsidiaries, or
their customers, were entered into in accordance with all applicable laws,
rules, regulations and regulatory policies; and each of them constitutes the
valid and legally binding obligation of the Company or one of the Company
Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditor\'s rights or by general
equity principles) and each is in full force and effect. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary, nor to Sellers\' or the Company\'s knowledge any
other party thereto, is in breach of any of its material obligations under
any such agreement or arrangement.   SECTION 3.35 Insurance Subsidiary
Loans. None of the Sellers, the Company, the Insurance Subsidiary or the
Company Subsidiaries has been notified or has reason to believe that any of
the    loans covered and reinsured by the Insurance Subsidiary have or are
likely to experience Losses that, in the aggregate, will exceed the first
layer of risk reinsured by the Insurance Subsidiary (above which layer the
Insurance Subsidiary would be responsible for Losses).   SECTION 3.36
Disclaimer of Additional and Implied Warranties. The Sellers are making no
representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied, except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement.   ARTICLE IV.   REPRESENTATIONS

of the Purchaser and its Affiliates reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish to the officers, employees and authorized
agents and representatives of the Purchaser copies of all correspondence
between the Company and its Subsidiaries and Agencies or Governmental
Entities and such additional financial and operating data and other
information regarding the assets, properties, goodwill and business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as the Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably request; provided, however, that such investigation shall not
unreasonably interfere with any of the businesses or operations of any of the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, no investigation conducted
by the Purchaser shall limit or affect in any way any of the representations
or warranties contained in Article III.   SECTION 5.03 Books and Records.
The Purchaser agrees that it shall preserve and keep all books and records of
the Company prior to the Closing in the Purchaser\'s possession for a period
of at least five years from the Closing Date. During such five-year period,
duly authorized representatives of the Sellers shall, upon reasonable notice,
have access thereto during normal business hours to examine, inspect and copy
such books and records for bona fide business purposes; provided, however,
that such investigation shall not unreasonably interfere with any of the
businesses or operations of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries).   SECTION 5.04
Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and applicable law, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as practicable, including such actions or things as the Purchaser or
the Sellers, respectively, may reasonably request in order to cause any of
the conditions to the Purchaser\'s or the Sellers\' respective
obligation to    consummate such transactions specified in Article VII of
this Agreement to be fully satisfied. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Sellers and the Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and representatives, to) consult
and fully cooperate with and provide assistance to each other in (i) promptly
obtaining all necessary consents, approvals, waivers, licenses, permits,
authorizations, registrations, qualifications, or other permission or action
by, and giving all necessary notices to and making all necessary filings with
and applications and submissions to, any Governmental Entity or other Person
as soon as reasonably practicable; (ii) seeking termination of any waiting
period under the HSR Act; (iii) providing all such information about such
party, its Subsidiaries and its officers, directors, partners and Affiliates
and making all applications and filings as may be necessary or reasonably
required in connection with any of the foregoing; and (iv) in general,
consummating and making effective the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that notwithstanding any other terms or provisions of this
Agreement, in no event shall any party or its Affiliates be deemed to have
any obligation to dispose of any assets or properties or to enter into any
agreement with any Person in order to obtain early termination or expiration
of the waiting period under the HSR Act or to obtain any other consents,
waivers, authorizations or approvals.   SECTION 5.05 Notice of Certain
Matters; Company Reports. (a) The Sellers shall give prompt written notice to
the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall give prompt written notice to the
Sellers, of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, occurrence
or failure to occur of which would be likely to cause any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the
Closing Date and (ii) any material failure of the Sellers or the Purchaser,
as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, and the Sellers
and the Purchaser, as the case may be, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to remedy such failure.   (b) Unless prohibited by
applicable law, the Sellers shall promptly provide the Purchaser with true
and complete copies of all Company Reports filed with a Governmental Entity
between the date hereof and the Closing Date.   SECTION 5.06 No
Solicitation. The Sellers shall not, and shall not authorize or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives, agents or other Persons controlled by
it to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage or solicit (including by way of
furnishing non-public    information), or take any other action to
facilitate, any inquiry or proposal from any Person (other than Purchaser and
its Affiliates and representatives) concerning any merger, consolidation,
sale of substantial assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar
transaction involving the Shares or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(ii) entertain, agree to, endorse, or participate in any discussions or
negotiations or provide third parties with nonpublic information relating to
any such inquiry or proposal. The Sellers agree to notify the Purchaser
promptly upon receipt of any such written inquiry or proposal.   SECTION
5.07 Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation. (a) For a period of four years from the
Closing Date, each of the Sellers agrees not to engage, directly or
indirectly, in the residential mortgage banking business in the United States
(the "Restricted Business") without the consent of Purchaser; provided,
however, that Sellers may originate residential mortgage loans as a part of
the general banking business of Sterling in the manner that Sterling
has heretofore originated such residential mortgage loans (it being
understood and agreed that the Sellers shall not be authorized hereunder to
establish any program to originate residential mortgages for the purpose of
reselling such mortgages in the secondary mortgage market). Each of the
Sellers has reviewed the provision of this Section 5.07 with legal counsel
and acknowledge that the Purchaser would be irreparably injured by a
violation of this Section, that the provisions of this Section are reasonable
and that the Purchaser could not be adequately compensated in damages for any
such violation, in light of the sensitivity of the non-public knowledge of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that the Sellers possess. Each of the
Sellers agree that the Purchaser, in addition to any other remedies available
to it for any breach or threatened breach of this Section, shall be entitled
to seek a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order or other
equivalent relief restraining Sellers from any such breach or threatened
breach.   (b) Notwithstanding Section 5.07(a), (i) each of the Sellers may,
without the prior consent of the Purchaser, acquire a Person that operates a
Restricted Business if Sellers divest, or enter into a definitive agreement
to sell or otherwise divest, such portion of such Person\'s business that is
a Restricted Business within six (6) months of such acquisition (even
if after the fourth anniversary of the Closing) and (ii)Parent may sell all
of its issued and outstanding capital stock to, or enter into a merger or
consolidation with, a Person that operates a Restricted Business.   (c) For
a period of four years from the Closing Date, each of the Sellers agrees not
to solicit for employment or hire any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is working for the Company    or any of its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing. The restriction set forth in this Section 5.07(c) shall
not apply to the solicitation or hiring of any employee of the Company (i)
who contacts the Sellers on his or her own initiative without any direct or
indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the Sellers or their
representatives, (ii) who contacted the Sellers in response to a
general advertisement, (iii) who acts as a secretary, receptionist or
administrative assistant or similar clerical capacity (but not including loan
processors, underwriters, closers or persons carrying out similar functions)
or as to whom Sellers have notified the Purchaser in writing that a Seller or
one of its Affiliates intends to solicit or hire such employee who was
working for the Company as of the Closing and Purchaser consents to such
solicitation or hiring in writing. Each of the Sellers agrees that the
Purchaser, in addition to any other remedies available to it for any breach
or threatened breach of this Section, shall be entitled to seek a preliminary
injunction, temporary restraining order or other equivalent relief
restraining Sellers from any such breach or threatened breach.   SECTION
5.08 Employee Benefits. (a) Following the Closing, the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries will be provided employee retirement, welfare
and other benefits, fringes, and perquisites that are either at least
generally comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company or its
applicable Subsidiary as of the Closing or generally comparable in
the aggregate to those provided by the Purchaser to similarly situated
employees of the Purchaser, as elected by the Purchaser in its sole
discretion. The Purchaser will cause its employee benefit plans in which such
employees are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of
eligibility and vesting thereunder, but not for purposes of benefit accrual,
the prior service of such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries as
if such service were with the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, to the same
extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company.
Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be subject to any
waiting periods or pre-existing condition limitations under the medical,
dental and health plans of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries in which they
are eligible to participate. Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
will retain credit for vacation pay that has been accrued as of the Closing
and, for purposes of determining the entitlement of such employees to
vacation pay following the Closing, the service of such employees with the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall be treated as if such service was with the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of the
Purchaser to amend or terminate at any time any of the Company Compensation
and Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms. With respect to the matters
described in this Section 5.08, the Company and its Subsidiaries will use
their commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the Purchaser
(and    consider in good faith the advice of the Purchaser) prior to
sending any broad-based notices or other communication materials of a general
nature to employees relating to benefits or compensation to be provided after
the Closing.   (b) Prior to the Closing, (i) the Company shall take
all actions necessary to terminate the Company\'s 401(k) Plan effective as of
the day prior to the Closing Date, including adopting resolutions of the
Company Board of Directors and (ii) effective as of the day prior to the
Closing Date, the persons serving as trustees (collectively, the "Existing
Trustees") shall resign as trustee of the Company\'s 401(k) Plan and
concurrently therewith the Purchaser shall designate a successor trustee to
assume the obligations of the Existing Trustees under the Company\'s 401(k)
Plan.   (c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary to terminate the Company\'s
Deferred Compensation Plan (including fully vesting all participants in their
Company contributions subaccounts) effective as of the day prior to the
Closing, including obtaining any necessary written consents and adopting
resolutions of the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of
Directors.   SECTION 5.09 Intercompany Accounts. The Sellers shall
settle, and cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to settle, at or prior to
the Closing, any intercompany accounts between the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Sellers and their Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, identified by
Purchaser.   SECTION 5.10 Excluded Business Removal.   (a) The Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transfer of the Servicing Business in accordance
with Section 3.19 prior to the Closing. The Sellers agree that neither the
Servicing Business Agreement nor the Subservicing Agreement may be amended,
nor any provision thereof waived, prior to the Closing without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser. The cash proceeds from such sale shall be
used (i) to pay down the Warehouse Credit Agreement with Sterling, (ii) to
invest in certificates of deposit with a maturity of one month or less at a
bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or (iii) in
any other manner approved in writing by the Purchaser; provided, however,
that nothing in this sentence shall require the Company to maintain any
minimum level of cash on hand.     (b) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers
shall cause the Company to transfer the interests owned by it or its
Subsidiaries in the Excluded Subsidiaries listed as such in paragraph 5.10 of
the Sellers Disclosure Schedule to the Seller or its Affiliates such that, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, Purchaser and its Affiliates, including
after the Closing the Company and its Subsidiaries, will be subject to no
liability or recourse with respect to the Excluded Subsidiaries in any
way.   (c) Prior to the Closing, pursuant to an agreement acceptable to the
Purchaser, the Sellers shall cause the Company to transfer its OREO to
Sterling at a price equal to the book value of the OREO on the balance sheet
of the Company as of June 30, 2003, included in Exhibit 2.04(a).   SECTION
5.11 Bank Purchase. Parent agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to offer for sale to Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser within one year
from the date of this Agreement, a "stripped charter" bank with its home
office in the State of Texas. If accepted, the purchase price for such bank
shall be equal to the sum of the net tangible book value of such bank plus a
$250,000 premium. The other terms of any such purchase and sale shall be as
agreed between Parent and Purchaser.   SECTION 5.12 Insurance. Sellers agree
that in the event of any claims against present and former directors and
officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events that
occurred prior to Closing that are eligible for coverage under insurance
issued to Sellers or any of their Affiliates, Sellers will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to file a claim for any such directors or
officers pursuant to such policy or policies.   SECTION 5.13 Sellers\' Names
and Marks. No later than the thirtieth (30th) Business Day following the
Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
to (a) change their legal names to names that do not contain the word
"Sterling" or any approximation thereof, and (b) cease to use any and all
trademarks, service marks and trade names owned by the Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (collectively
"Sellers\' Marks") in all respects, and to replace or remove Sellers\' Marks
on signage, advertising materials and other materials. The Sellers shall
cooperate with the Purchaser (but shall have no obligation to incur out-of-
pocket expenses unless the Purchaser agrees to reimburse the Sellers for such
expenses) prior to the Closing in order to assist the Purchaser in carrying
out its obligations under the immediately preceding sentence within the time
frame specified. The Purchaser agrees that the Sellers, in addition to any
other remedies available to them for any breach or    threatened breach of
this Section, shall be entitled to seek a preliminary injunction, temporary
restraining order or other equivalent relief restraining the Purchaser from
any such breach or threatened breach.   SECTION 5.14 Sale of Mortgage Loans.
The Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to sell Mortgage Loans that
are originated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the quantity of Mortgage Loans sold and the timing of such
sales).   SECTION 5.15 Legal Services Agreement. The Company shall
not amend or terminate the Legal Services Agreement, dated July 16, 2003,
between the Company and Harpole and Associates, P.C., without the Purchaser\'s
prior written consent.   SECTION 5.16 Assumption of Earnout. From and after
the Closing, the Purchaser will cause the Company to fully assume and perform
in all respects all of the obligations of Select Capital Mortgage Company, a
Washington corporation and Subsidiary of the Company as of the date hereof
("Select"), to Alliance Mortgage, Inc., a Washington corporation
("Alliance"), and its successors and assigns to pay the portion of the
deferred and outstanding purchase price owed by Select for the assets of
Alliance, represented by that certain Non-Negotiable Promissory Note A-4,
dated April 1, 2000 and due on or before March 31, 2004, in the original
principal amount of $78,871 (together with any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon and other changes thereto).   SECTION 5.17 Restructuring. The
Purchaser agrees to consider any proposal the Sellers may make to restructure
the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, but
shall be under no obligation to accept any such proposal.   ARTICLE VI.  
TAX MATTERS   SECTION 6.01 Section 338(h)(10) and 754 Elections. (a)
With respect to the acquisition of the Shares hereunder, if and to the
extent requested by the Purchaser in writing, the Sellers and the Purchaser
shall jointly make an election or elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and any corresponding elections under state, local and foreign tax laws
with respect to the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Election").
If such an Election is made, (i) the Sellers and the Purchaser shall, as
promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, cooperate with each other
to take all actions necessary and    appropriate (including filing such
forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required)
to effect and preserve a timely Election in accordance with Section
338(h)(10) of the Code or any successor provisions and the corresponding
provisions of state, local and foreign tax laws, (ii) the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall report the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement
consistent with the Election and shall take no position contrary thereto in
any Tax Return, in any discussion with or proceeding before any taxing
authority, or otherwise, unless otherwise required by applicable law
and (iii) Seller represents and covenants that (A) the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries for which an Election is made is and until the Closing Date,
will be, a member of a group of corporations which (for the taxable period
which ends on the Closing Date) files a consolidated return for United States
federal income tax purposes, and (B) will provide the IRS all information
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is
required by the Code, the United States Treasury Regulations and any similar
provision of any applicable state, local or foreign law.   (b) Schedule
6.01(b) sets forth the name of each Subsidiary of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that is taxed as a partnership for United States federal income
tax purposes and whether each such Subsidiary has made an election under
Section 754 of the Code or any similar provisions of state, local or foreign
tax law (a "Section 754 Election"). If and to the extent requested by the
Purchaser in writing after the date hereof, the Sellers shall use their best
efforts to cause any Subsidiary of the Company or its Subsidiaries that is
taxed as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes to make
a Section 754 Election.   (c) If an Election is made, the Purchaser will
determine a purchase price and a final allocation of that price among the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company Assets") that are
deemed to have been acquired pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or
state or local law equivalent (the "Final Allocation"). Sellers shall have
the right to object to the Final Allocation solely on the grounds that the
Final Allocation is not in accordance with the fair market value of the
Company Assets or is otherwise inconsistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the
Code, the United States Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
applicable similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. Any such
objection shall be delivered to the Purchaser in writing no more than 10
Business Days after the Final Allocation is delivered to the Sellers. If
Sellers object, Sellers and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve the objection. If Sellers and the Purchaser cannot resolve such
objection within 30 Business Days, the objection shall be referred to an
independent accounting firm of international standing mutually acceptable by
the Purchaser and the    Sellers for prompt resolution. The decision of
such accounting firm shall be binding on the Purchaser and the Sellers. The
Final Allocation shall be amended to reflect the decision of such accounting
firm or the results of any such negotiations.   (d) The Sellers and the
Purchaser (i) shall be bound by the Final Allocation for purposes of
determining any and all consequences with respect to Taxes of the
transactions contemplated herein (ii) shall prepare and file all Tax Returns
to be filed with any taxing authority in a manner consistent with the Final
Allocation and (iii) shall take no position inconsistent with the Final
Allocation in any Tax Return, in any discussion with or proceeding before any
taxing authority, or otherwise. In the event that the Final Allocation is
disputed by any taxing authority and in the event that the applicable statute
of limitations has not expired with respect to either the Sellers or the
Purchaser, the party receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify
and consult with the other parties hereto concerning resolution of such
dispute, and no such dispute shall be finally settled or compromised without
the mutual consent of the Sellers and the Purchaser, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.   SECTION 6.02 Tax Indemnities. (a) The Sellers
shall indemnify the Purchaser, the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries against all Taxes (including, without limitation, any obligation
to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a consolidated, combined
or unitary basis with respect to a group of corporations that includes or
included the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and Taxes resulting from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries ceasing to be a member of a tax group that
includes any person other than the Purchaser or its Affiliates) (i) imposed
on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable for any taxable year or period that
ends on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any taxable year or
period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period"), the portion of such taxable year or period ending on and including
the Closing Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any franchise or
similar Tax imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in 2004 which
amount may be determined by reference to the taxable income of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in 2003), (ii) imposed on the Sellers or any
Affiliates of the Sellers (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
for any taxable year, and (iii) imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may
otherwise be liable which are resulting from, attributed to, or caused by the
Election made according to Section 6.01(a) of this Agreement or Section 754
Election made according to Section 6.01(b) of this Agreement.     (b)
Except as provided in Section 6.02(a), the Purchaser shall indemnify the
Sellers against any liability imposed on the Sellers with respect to the
Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable year or
period that begins on the day after the Closing Date and, with respect to any
taxable year or period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date,
the portion of such taxable year or period beginning on the day after
the Closing Date.   (c) To the extent permitted by law or
administrative practice, the taxable year of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall end on and include the Closing Date. For purposes of
Sections 6.02(a) and (b), whenever it is necessary to determine the liability
for Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a portion of a
taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date,
the determination of the Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, for the portion of the year or period ending on, and the
portion of the year or period beginning on the day after the Closing Date,
shall be determined by assuming that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, had a taxable year or period that ended at the close of
the Closing Date, except that (i) real estate Taxes, or other property or
asset-based Taxes (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any
franchise or similar Taxes) and (ii) exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis shall be apportioned on a time basis
relative to the Closing Date.   SECTION 6.03 Tax Returns and Payments. (a)
The Sellers shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed (i) all
Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or
before the Closing Date and (ii) all Tax Returns due to be filed after the
Closing Date with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are
included on a consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return that is required
to be filed by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries) under the Code or any applicable provision of
state, local or foreign law (collectively, the "Seller Tax Returns").
Purchaser will prepare and file or cause to be prepared filed all other Tax
Returns due to be filed after the Closing Date by or with respect to the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, including Tax Returns for the Straddle
Period ("Straddle Returns").   (b) No later than 20 Business Days before the
due date (including any applicable extensions) of each Seller Tax Return,
Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser a copy of such Seller Tax Return (or,
in the case of a consolidated, unitary or combined Seller Tax Return that
includes the income or operations of persons other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries, a copy of a pro forma Tax Return including the income of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) for Purchaser\'s review.    Purchaser will
have the right to object to any item on any such Seller Tax Return 5 Business
Days of receipt of such Seller Tax Return to the extent the reporting of the
item is not consistent with the prior practice of the Company or its relevant
Subsidiary, or, in the case of a Seller Tax Return that is due to be filed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (i) the reporting of the item would
materially adversely affect the Purchaser, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates in a taxable year or
period ending on or after the Closing Date, or (ii) counsel for the Purchaser
advises Purchaser that it is not more likely than not that the proposed
manner of reporting such item on such Seller Tax Return will be upheld if
audited (the "Purchaser Objection"). The Sellers and the Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any Purchaser Objection. If the Sellers
and the Purchaser cannot fully resolve the Purchaser Objection within 5
Business Days of the date of the Purchaser Objection, the remaining disputed
items will be referred to an independent accounting firm of international
standing mutually acceptable to the Sellers and the Purchaser for prompt
resolution. At least two Business Days before any payment is due, the Sellers
shall transfer to Purchaser or such other Person as the Purchaser may direct,
any amount shown to be due with respect to any Seller Tax Return that is
required to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, taking into
account any changes that were agreed by the Sellers and Purchaser. Sellers
shall amend any pro forma Tax Return and the reporting of the requisite item
on any other Tax Return required to be prepared by Sellers pursuant to
Section 6.03(a) to reflect any change that was agreed by the Sellers and
Purchaser or made by the independent accounting firm.   (c) The Purchaser
will prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all other Tax Returns
not described in Section 6.03(a) or (b) that are due to be filed after the
Closing Date by or with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries,
including Tax Returns for the Straddle Period ("Straddle Returns"). The
Purchaser shall (i) notify the Sellers of any Taxes for which any Seller is
responsible pursuant to Section 6.02(a) that would be reflected on a pro
forma Straddle Return reflecting the Taxes for which the Seller is
responsible pursuant to Section 6.02(a) and that were not already paid by the
Sellers, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) promptly provide the Sellers such pro forma Straddle Return.
The Sellers will have the right to object to any item on any pro
forma income, franchise or similar Straddle Return within 5 Business Days of
receipt of such Straddle Return to the extent that the reporting of the item
(i)(A) is not consistent with the prior practice of the Company or its
relevant Subsidiary and such in compliance with applicable Tax law, and (B)
such prior practice was in accordance with the applicable Tax law and would
not materially adversely affect the Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates in a taxable    year
or period ending on or after the Closing Date or (ii) counsel for the Sellers
advises Sellers that it is not more likely than not that the proposed manner
of reporting such item on such Straddle Return will be upheld if audited (the
"Seller Objection"). The Sellers and the Purchaser shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any Seller Objection. If the Sellers and the Purchaser
cannot fully resolve such Seller Objection within 5 Business Days of the date
of the Seller Objection, the remaining disputed items will be referred to
an independent accounting firm of international standing mutually acceptable
to the Sellers and the Purchaser for prompt resolution. The Sellers shall
remit to the Purchaser (or any Person directed by Purchaser) the amount that
Seller owes or is deemed to owe pursuant to the procedures contained in this
Section 6.03(c) no later than 5 Business Days after receipt of such notice,
or if there is a Seller Objection, no later than the earlier of (i) 5
Business Days after the resolution of such Seller Objection or (ii) two
Business Days before the due date for the relevant Tax Return. The Purchaser
shall amend any Straddle Return to reflect any change that was agreed by the
Sellers and Purchaser or made by the independent accounting firm, and within
2 Business Days, refund any excess amount that such accounting firm
determines is due to the Sellers.   SECTION 6.04 Refunds. Any net refunds
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any successor to the
foregoing, of Taxes for which the Sellers are liable under Section 6.02 shall
be for the account of the Sellers. The Purchaser shall, at the reasonable
request of the Sellers, cause the Company or its relevant Subsidiary to file
for and obtain any refunds to which the Sellers are entitled under this
Section 6.04 unless (i) claiming the refund would adversely affect the
Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates in a taxable year or period ending on or after the Closing Date or
(ii) counsel for the Purchaser advises in writing that it is not more likely
that not that the full amount of such refund would be sustained, if subject
to audit. The Sellers shall reimburse the Purchaser, the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all of their expenses in connection therewith. In the event
that any refund of Taxes for which payment has been made pursuant to this
paragraph is subsequently reduced or disallowed, the Sellers shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Tax
liability, including interest and penalties, assessed against such payor by
reason of the reduction or disallowance.   SECTION 6.05 Contests. (a)
Notification of Contests. Each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand (the "Recipient"), shall notify the other party in
writing within 30 days of receipt by the Recipient of written notice of any
pending or    threatened audits, adjustments or assessments (a "Tax
Audit") that may affect the liability for Taxes of such other party.   (b)
Which Party Controls. (i) The Sellers shall have the right to represent the
Company and its Subsidiaries\' interests in any tax audit or administrative
or court proceeding relating to taxable years or periods ending on or before
the Closing Date that include the income or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. The
Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in the portion of any such audit
or proceeding relating to the income or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (a "Pre-Closing Company Tax Audit") and employ counsel of
its choice at its own expense. The Sellers shall keep the Purchaser informed
of the status of material changes in the Pre-Closing Company Tax Audit, and

comment on any material written correspondence received or proposed to be
delivered with respect to the tax position of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with any such Pre-Closing Company Tax Audit. The
Sellers shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any such claim for Taxes that would adversely
affect the liability for Taxes of the Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any period after the Closing Date
to any extent (including, but not limited to, the imposition of income tax
deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments, the
lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of
amortization or depreciation deductions, or the reduction of loss or credit
carryforwards) without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld.   (ii) The Purchaser shall have
the right to represent the  Company and its Subsidiaries\' interests in any
tax audit or  administrative or court proceeding with respect to any Straddle
Period.  The Sellers shall have the right to participate at its expense in
the  defense of any such claim to the extent that the Sellers would be 
required to indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.02(a), and to 
employ counsel of its choice at its own expense. The Purchaser shall  keep
the Sellers informed of the status of any such audit or  proceeding, and
shall provide the Purchaser with a reasonable  opportunity to review and
comment on any material written  correspondence received or proposed to be
delivered with respect to the  tax position of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection  with any such audit or proceeding. The Purchaser
shall not be entitled  to settle or to cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to settle,  either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any  such     claim to the extent that Sellers would be
required to indemnify the  Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.02(a) without the
prior written consent  of Sellers, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.   (iii) The Purchaser shall have the sole right to
represent  the Company and its Subsidiaries\' interests in any other tax
audit or  administrative or court proceeding.   SECTION 6.06 Information
Reporting Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates, including
the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing, for the amount of any
Taxes imposed on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (i) with respect to
information returns filed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates within 24
months after the Closing Date where such Tax arises out of actions taken or
omitted to be taken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in reliance upon
the representations in Section 3.15 of this Agreement or the covenants in
this Section 6.06 with respect to such information returns or (ii) because
prior to the Closing Date, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries did
not receive (and retain in its files) a properly completed Form W-8, W 9, or
similar form from a Person from whom it was then required to obtain (unless
the Company and/or its Subsidiaries complied with any applicable back-up
withholding requirements) or was not properly withholding on payments to the
payee.   SECTION 6.07 Closing Date Transactions. The Purchaser and
the Sellers agree to report all transactions not in the ordinary course of
business occurring on the Closing Date after the Purchaser\'s purchase of the
Shares on the Purchaser\'s federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted
by United States Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). The
Purchaser and the Sellers further agree to report all transactions occurring
on the Closing Date but prior to the Closing that result in either income or
expenses on the Sellers\' consolidated federal income Tax Return, unless
otherwise required by applicable Tax law. The Sellers shall not enter into
any transaction outside of the ordinary course of business that would cause
any income that otherwise should have been reported as occurring prior to the
Closing on the Closing Date to be treated as having occurred after the
Closing on the Closing Date or any expense that otherwise should have been
treated as occurring after the Closing on the Closing Date as having occurred
before the Closing on the Closing Date.   SECTION 6.08 Assistance and
Cooperation. After the Closing Date, the Sellers, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall each:     (a) assist the other in the
preparation of any Tax  Returns which such other party is responsible for
preparing or filing  in accordance with this Article VI; and   (b) make
available to the other and to any taxing  authority as reasonably requested
all information, records, and  documents relating to Taxes of the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries.   SECTION 6.09 Miscellaneous. (a) The Sellers and
the Purchaser agree to treat all payments made by either to or for the
benefit of the other (including any payments to the Company or its
Subsidiaries) under this Article VI, and any other payments made under this
Agreement, as adjustments to the Purchase Price.   (b) For purposes of this
Article VI, the "Purchaser"  shall include each member of the Affiliated
group of corporations or  entities of which it is or becomes a member.  
(c) Any tax allocation or sharing agreement or  arrangement, whether or not
written, that may have been entered into by  Sellers or any of their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, shall be terminated as to  the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing Date.   (d) The obligations of the Sellers and the
Purchaser set  forth in this Article VI shall be unconditional and absolute
and shall  survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable
statutes of  limitation (including any waivers or extensions thereof);
provided,  however, that any claim for indemnification shall survive beyond
such  date if written notice thereof stating the indemnification asserted
or  claimed has been given to the indemnifying party prior to the date on 
which the related obligation to indemnify shall terminate.   ARTICLE

Other Consents and Notices. The Sellers and the  Company shall have received
any required consents from all parties to  any material Contract to which the

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   SECTION 8.01 Termination. This Agreement
may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:   (a) by the mutual
written consent of the Sellers and the  Purchaser;     (b) by either the
Sellers or the Purchaser, if the  Closing shall not have occurred prior to
December 31, 2003; provided,  however, that (A) the right to terminate this
Agreement under this  Section 8.01(b) shall not be available to the Sellers
when the Sellers\'  failure to fulfill any of their obligations under this
Agreement shall  have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the
failure of the  Closing to occur prior to such date, and (B) the right to
terminate  this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b) shall not be available
to the  Purchaser when the Purchaser\'s failure to fulfill any of its 
obligations under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall  have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such  date;   (c)
by the Purchaser (with written notice to the  Sellers), in the event of
either: (i) a breach of any representation or  warranty contained herein by
Sellers, which breach cannot be or has not  been cured within 30 days after
the giving of written notice to the  Sellers of such breach; or (ii) a breach
of any of the covenants or  agreements contained herein by the Sellers or
their Affiliates, which  breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30
days after the giving  of written notice to the Sellers of such breach and,
in the case of (i)  or (ii), such breach, individually or in the aggregate
with other  breaches of the sort referred to in (i) or (ii), would cause
the  conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) not to be satisfied or would 
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially  impair the
ability of the Purchaser or the Sellers to consummate the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) by the Sellers (with written notice to
the  Purchaser), in the event of either: (i) a breach of any representation 
or warranty contained herein by the Purchaser, which breach cannot be  or has
not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice  to the
Purchaser of such breach; or (ii) a breach of any of the  covenants or
agreements contained herein by the Purchaser, which breach  cannot be or has
not been cured within 30 days after the giving of  written notice to the
Purchaser of such breach and, in the case of (i)  or (ii), such breach,
individually or in the aggregate with other  breaches of the sort referred to
in (i) or (ii), would cause the  conditions set forth in Section 7.01(a) not
to be satisfied or would  reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay
or materially  impair the ability of the Purchaser or the Sellers to
consummate the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 8.02

any time prior to the Closing, the Purchaser or the Seller may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the

limitations stated in this Article IX, from and after the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser and each of
its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries following the
Closing Date) from and against any and all Losses (but only after such
Losses, other than those described in Section 9.01(a)(ii) or (v), exceed
$1,000,000 in the aggregate, in which event the Sellers shall be liable only
for the amount of all such Losses in excess of such threshold) and, as
provided in Section 6.02 of this Agreement, Taxes that any of them actually
suffer, incur or sustain arising out of or attributable to (whether or not
arising out of third party claims):   (i) Any breach of any representation
or warranty  made by the Sellers in this Agreement or any certificate or 
other document executed and delivered by any of them (or by  any of their
officers or directors) in connection with the  transactions contemplated
hereby;   (ii) Any breach of any covenant to be performed  by the Sellers
or their Affiliates in connection with the  transactions contemplated
hereby;   (iii) Any legal proceedings or investigations  pending or
threatened against the Company or its Subsidiaries  or Affiliates or
violations of law, Contracts or duties or  standards of care occurring on or
before the Closing Date;     (iv) Any required contribution by the
Purchaser  under any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in  Section
3(1) of ERISA) of the Company attributable to periods  on or before the
Closing Date; or   (v) Any of the matters identified in Exhibit 
9.01(a)(v), to the full extent not covered by any of clauses  (i)-(iv)
above.   (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this  Article IX,
and subject to the limitations stated in this Article IX,  from and after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend  and hold harmless the
Sellers and each of their respective Affiliates  from and against any and all
Losses (but only after such Losses exceed  $1,000,000 in the aggregate, in
which event the Purchaser shall be  liable only for the amount of all such
Losses in excess of such  threshold) which any of them actually suffer, incur
or sustain arising  out of or attributable to (whether or not arising out of
third party  claims) (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by
the  Purchaser in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered to Sellers 
by Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or  (ii)
any breach of any covenant to be performed by the Purchaser in  connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby   (c) In no event shall Sellers\'
aggregate obligation to  indemnify the Purchaser and its Affiliates exceed an
amount equal to  $50,000,000 and in no event shall the Purchaser\'s aggregate
obligation  to indemnify the Sellers and its Affiliates exceed an amount
equal to  $50,000,000.   (d) In calculating the amount of any Loss for
which the  Purchaser and its Affiliates may be entitled to indemnification
under  this Article, there shall be taken into consideration the amount of
any  payments the indemnified party or its Affiliates in fact receives 
pursuant to insurance policies issued by insurance companies (other  than the
Insurance Subsidiary) to the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries (but not
pursuant to insurance policies issued to the  Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates) as a direct consequence of the  circumstances to which the Losses
related or from which the Losses  resulted or arose.   (e) The
indemnification obligation of the parties  pursuant to this Article IX shall
not, except in the case of fraud,  include punitive or exemplary damages;
provided that any punitive or  exemplary damages recovered by a third party
against a party     entitled to indemnity pursuant to this Article IX
shall be included in  the Losses recoverable under such indemnity.   (f)
The indemnified party shall promptly notify the  indemnifying party of the
discovery by it of, or the assertion against  it of, any claim or potential
liability for which indemnification is  provided herein or the commencement
of any action or proceeding in  respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder; provided, however,  that the failure promptly to give such notice
shall affect any  indemnified party\'s rights hereunder only to the extent
that such  failure shall (i) actually materially and adversely affect any 
indemnifying party or its rights hereunder or (ii) result in the  indemnified
party failing to give notice of a claim for indemnification  prior to the
expiration of the survival period set forth in Section  10.01 hereof to which
the claim relates.   (g) The right of an indemnified party under this
Section  9.01 shall be subject to the following conditions and limitations:
(i)  notice of any claim for indemnification under Section 9.01(a)(i) or 
Section 9.01(b)(i) shall have been given prior to the expiration of the 
survival period of the representation or warranty to which the claim 
relates; (ii) notice of any claim for indemnification with respect to 
Article VI, shall have been given prior to the expiration of the  applicable
statute of limitations (giving effect to any extensions  thereof) for the
assertion of claims by the relevant Tax authority;  (iii) with respect to a
claim for indemnification arising out of or  involving an assertion by a
third party of liability on the part of an  indemnified party, the
indemnified party shall advise the indemnifying  party of all facts relating
to such assertion within the knowledge of  the indemnified party, and shall
afford the indemnifying party the  opportunity, at the indemnifying party\'s
cost and expense, to defend  against such claims for liability; in any such
action or proceeding,  the indemnified party shall have the right to retain
its own counsel  and to participate in the defense, but the fees and expenses
of such  counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i)
the  indemnifying party and indemnified party mutually agree in writing to 
the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such  suit,
action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include  both the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party and, in the  reasonable judgment
of the indemnified party, representation of the  indemnifying party and the
indemnified party by the same counsel would  be inadvisable due to actual or
potential differing or conflicts of  interest between them.     (h) The
indemnifying party shall have the right to settle  or compromise any claim or
liability subject to indemnification under  this Section 9.01 that is
susceptible to being settled or compromised;  provided, however, that any
such settlement shall require the consent  of the indemnified party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld; provided further, however, that
the consent of the  indemnified party shall not be required if (i) the terms
of the  settlement require only the payment of damages and payment of the
full  amount of the relevant indemnification obligation to the indemnified 
party is assured and (ii) the indemnified party is not otherwise  adversely
affected by the terms of the settlement.   (i) For the limited purposes of
determining the Seller\'s  indemnification obligations under this Article IX,
(i) the  "materiality" test established by the use of the terms material, 
materially, material adverse effect or similar words to that effect in  this
Agreement and (ii) the qualification established by the use of the  term
"knowledge" or similar words to that effect in this Agreement  shall be
deemed to have been met whenever a party has incurred,  suffered or sustained
a Loss.   (j) With respect to the timing of payments for the  matters
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(v), the Purchaser and  its
Affiliates shall be entitled to indemnification payments under this  Article
IX against any Losses in respect of such matters at the end of  each
successive six-month period starting on the date that is six  months after
the Closing Date (or if such day is not a Business Day, on  the next
succeeding Business Day) (or the earlier date within any such  six-month
period on which such Losses as to which they have theretofore  not received
indemnification payments exceed $250,000), to the full  extent of such
Losses.   (k) Following the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy  of the
Sellers and the Purchaser with respect to any and all claims  relating to the
matters addressed in Sections 9.01(a) and 9.01(b) shall  be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article  IX; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply to claims (i)  by the Purchaser to enforce
the provisions of Article II (but only if  Section 7.02 is satisfied); (ii)
by the Sellers to enforce the  provisions of Article II (but only if Section
7.01 is satisfied) (iii)  by the Purchaser to enforce Section 5.06 or 5.07;
(iv) by the Sellers  to enforce Section 5.13; (v) by Sellers or Purchaser to
enforce Section  10.02, 10.07 or 10.14; (vi) by the Sellers or the Purchaser
to enforce  the provisions of Article VI or this Article IX;     and
(vii) by the Sellers or the Purchaser asserting common law fraud.   (l)

the remedies provided by this Agreement and  applicable law, the parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the Sellers  shall be entitled to specific
performance for any breach of the  Purchaser\'s obligations under Article II
of this Agreement, provided  that all of the conditions to Closing set forth
in Section 7.02 shall  have been satisfied and that the Purchaser has no
right to terminate  the Agreement under Section 8.01, and (ii) the Purchaser
shall be  entitled to specific performance for any breach of the Sellers\' 
obligations under Article II of this Agreement, provided that all of  the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.01 shall have been  satisfied
and that the Sellers have no right under Section 8.01 to  terminate the
Agreement.   ARTICLE X.   GENERAL PROVISIONS   SECTION 10.01 Survival of
