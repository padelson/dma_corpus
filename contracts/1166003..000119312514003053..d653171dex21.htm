corporation (" _ _Parent__ "), and Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Tennessee
corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _ _Merger
Sub__ ").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _ _Company Board__ ")
has (i) determined that this Agreement is in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders, and has adopted and approved this Agreement with
Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company in accordance with the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the " _
_TBCA__ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement (the " _ _Merger__ "), and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of
this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company; 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have each
adopted, approved and declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement
providing for the Merger in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation
Law and the TBCA, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, as well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I __

_The Merger _

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time and in accordance with the TBCA, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
" _ _Surviving Corporation__ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company under the laws of the State of Tennessee, with all of its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except as otherwise set forth in this _Article I_.

1.2 _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall
take place at the offices of Winston and Strawn LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York,
New York, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the third business day (the " _
_Closing Date__ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in _Article V_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature   are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver
of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement; _provided_ _that_ , the Closing shall not occur during the period
from and including April 1, 2014 through and including April 30, 2014 (the " _
_Marketing Period__ ") without the prior written consent of Parent if (and
only if) Parent delivers a written notification to the Company, at any time
between March 22, 2014 and including March 31, 2014, certifying that (A)
Parent intends to obtain Financing pursuant to the Financing Commitment (or
alternative debt financing pursuant to alternative debt financing commitment
letters that (1) do not include additional or different conditions to closing
(as compared to the Financing Commitment) that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or delay the funding of the Financing or the consummation of
the Transactions beyond the date the parties hereto are obligated to close
pursuant to this _Section 1.2_ (giving effect to this proviso) and (2)
provide for a syndication period as a requirement to such alternative
financing); and (B) assuming the accuracy of the representations set forth in
_Section 3.1_ and compliance by the Company with its agreements under this
Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing or such alternative debt financing, as the case may be, will not be
satisfied on or prior to the date on which the parties hereto are obligated to
close pursuant to this _Section 1.2_ (giving effect to this proviso) (it
being understood that, if all of the conditions set forth in _Article V_
shall have been satisfied or waived during the Marketing Period (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), and such
conditions remain satisfied or waived on May 1, 2014 then the Closing shall
occur on May 1, 2014 unless Parent agrees for the Closing to occur earlier).
Nothing herein shall prohibit Parent from seeking to replace all or a portion
of the Financing or such alternative debt financing with proceeds from an
equity financing consummated during the Marketing Period. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _ _business day__ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59
p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks
are required or authorized to remain closed in the City of New York.

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause the articles of merger (the " _ _Tennessee
Articles of Merger__ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee as provided in Section 48-21-107
of the TBCA. The Merger shall become effective on the effective date of the
Tennessee Articles of Merger (the " _ _Effective Time__ ").

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects provided for
in this Agreement, the Tennessee Articles of Merger and the applicable
provisions of the TBCA.

 

1.5 _Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. The charter of the
Company (the " _ _Charter__ ") shall be amended as a result of the Merger to
be in a form determined by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
and, as so amended, shall be the charter of the Surviving Corporation, until
duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws. The bylaws of the
Company (the " _ _Bylaws__ ") in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws.

 

1.6 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the
Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have
been duly elected or appointed and

 



2  qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Charter and the Bylaws. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of
Merger Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time until their successors shall have been duly elected or

_Shares__ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and not, in each case, held on
behalf of third parties and (ii) Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company and not, in each case, held on behalf of
third parties (each, an " _ _Excluded Share__ " and collectively, " _
_Excluded Share__ s")) shall be converted into the right to receive
the following consideration upon the surrender of a certificate formerly

Entry Shares__ "): (x) $6.00 in cash, without interest (the " _ _Per Share
Cash Consideration__ ") and (y) a fraction of a share of common stock, par

given Share shall mean the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share
Stock Consideration. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to
be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, each Certificate

---|---|--- 
 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to

4  unreasonably withheld or delayed) (and pursuant to an agreement in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the " _ _Exchange
Agent__ "), in trust in a separate account for the benefit of holders of
Shares, (i) a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the
Exchange Agent to make the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration under
_Section 2.1(a)_ and (ii) uncertificated book-entry shares representing an
aggregate number of registered shares of Parent Common Stock to which holders
of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ (such cash and Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent

Agent shall invest the cash portion of the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent, _provided_ that such investments shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section
2.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent
that there are losses with respect to any such investments or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt cash
payment under _Section 2.1(a)_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to promptly replace, restore or increase the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments under _Section
2.1(a_).

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
2.2(f)_) to the Exchange Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree,
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in  _Section 2.2(f)_) or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor (A) a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to
(x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof as provided in  _Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares
multiplied by (y) the Per Share Cash Consideration plus cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and (B)
and a whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form) equal to (1) the number of Shares represented
by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in 
_Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (2) the Exchange Ratio
with any resulting fractional share paid as cash in lieu thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.5_, and such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon

 



5  due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon
due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registrations of transfer on the stock transfer books of the Company of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the shareholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment
of the Per Share Merger Consideration upon due surrender of its Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) or
Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _ _Person__ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including
not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity
or other entity of any kind or nature. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _ _Governmental Entity__ " shall mean any United States or foreign
governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court or other
legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity.

(e) _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable under this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid
over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as 

 



6  indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Share Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such
Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

2.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
Shares (a " _ _Company Option__ ") under the Stock Plans, vested or unvested,
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to
receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in
any event no later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an
amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the excess,
if any, of (i) the sum of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration plus (B) an
amount in cash equal to the product of (I) the Parent Stock Price multiplied
by (II) the Per Share Stock Consideration, in each case, determined in
accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_ of this Agreement (the " _ _Option Cash
Amount__ "), over (ii) the exercise price per Share under such Company Option,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
To the extent the exercise price of a Company Option is greater than or equal
to the Option Cash Amount, such Company Option shall be cancelled for no
consideration.

 

(b) _Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Share subject
to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions (a " _ _Restricted Share__
") and each outstanding restricted stock unit (a " _ _Restricted Stock Unit__
"), in each case, granted under the Stock Plans, shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3)
business days after the Effective Time), the Per Share Merger Consideration
with respect to each such outstanding Restricted Share and each such
outstanding Restricted Stock Unit, determined in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)_ of this Agreement, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment; _provided_ , that the applicable Taxes required to be
withheld shall be withheld from the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration
payable in respect of each holders Restricted Shares or Restricted Stock
Units.

(c) _Performance Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each performance stock
unit (a " _ _Performance Stock Unit__ ") under the Stock Plans, to the extent
unvested, shall vest as follows: (i) for completed performance periods, the
portion of the Performance Stock Unit eligible for vesting based on
achievement of the applicable performance targets set forth in the applicable
award agreement for such completed performance periods shall vest and (ii) for
performance periods that have not been completed as of the Effective Time, the
Performance Stock Units for such incomplete performance period shall vest as
if the target level of performance had been achieved as of the Effective Time
(Performance Stock Units that vest as a result of (i) and (ii) herein, the " _
_Vested PSUs__ "). Vested PSUs shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) business days after
the Effective Time) the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to each
such Vested PSU, determined in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_ of this

 



7  Agreement, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment; _provided_ , that the applicable Taxes required to be withheld
shall be withheld from the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration payable in
respect of each holders Performance Stock Units.

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt resolutions and provide any notices required to

_Sections 2.3(a)_, _2.3(b)_ and _2.3(c)_.

 

2.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes

Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of
a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration and payments pursuant to _Section 2.3_ shall be equitably
adjusted; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.4_ shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

2.5 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or with respect to
Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Shares converted by virtue of the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, shall
receive, in lieu of such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, from the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.5_, a
cash payment representing such owners proportionate interest, if any, in the
proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the
Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of
Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of shares
of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Shares pursuant to
_Section 2.2(b)_.

2.6  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

(a) _Certificates_. All Parent Common Stock to be issued under  _Section
2.1(a)_ shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and
whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of
the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after
the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No

paid to any holder of an unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_)
is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to
the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section
2.2(f)_), there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the Certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange thereof,

 



8  without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record

 _Representations and Warranties_

 

3.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth (i)
in the Company Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that a disclosure
therein is applicable to any particular representation or warranty set forth

looking statements" section in such Company Reports) or (ii) in the
corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to
Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _ _Company
Disclosure Letter__ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed

9  assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or
to have such power or authority, are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Change. The Company has
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys and its

Subsidiary__ " is as defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated

_Exchange Act__ ") and (iii) " _ _Company Material Adverse Change__ " means
any event, change, effect, development, circumstance, condition or occurrence
(each, a " _ _Change__ ") that, when considered individually or in the

obligations under, and consummate the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement (together with the Merger, the " _ _Transactions__ ") or (y) the
business, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;  _provided_ that no change or
development resulting from the following shall constitute or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse
Change under clause (y):

in the United States or other countries in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries conduct operations, including (1) any changes generally affecting
the securities, credit or financial markets, (2) any changes in interest or
exchange rates or (3) effect of any potential or actual government shutdown,
except to the extent such changes, developments, effects or events have a
disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, relative to others in the industry or industries in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries operate;

(B) changes, developments, effects or events in or affecting the industry or
industries in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries operate (including
such changes, developments, effects or events resulting from general economic

worsening of such conditions threatened or existing on the date of this
Agreement, except to the extent that such changes, developments, effects or
events have a disproportionate

 



10  adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
relative to others in the industry or industries in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate;

 

(E) changes, developments, effects or events after the date hereof in
applicable Laws or the definitive interpretations thereof, except to

(F) changes, developments, effects or events after the date hereof in United
States generally accepted accounting principles (" _ _GAAP__ ") or any

a whole, relative to others in the industry or industries in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries operate;

Change; and

(I) a decline in the price or trading volume of the Companys common stock;
_provided_ that the exception in this clause shall not prevent or otherwise
affect a determination that any change, development, effect or event
underlying such decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a
Company Material Adverse Change.

As used in this Agreement, " _ _Affiliate__ " means with respect to any
Person, any other Person which, directly or indirectly, controls, or is
controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person. As used in this
definition, " _ _control__ " (including, with its correlative meanings, " _
_controlled by__ " and " _ _under common control with__ ") shall mean the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of management or policies of a Person, whether through the ownership
of securities or partnership or other ownership interests, by contract or
otherwise.

(b) _Capital Structure_.

 

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 150,000,000
Shares, of which 35,388,493 Shares were outstanding as of the close of
business on January 3, 2014, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.01 per share, none of which were outstanding as of the date hereof.
All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of January 3, 2014, other
than 143,000 Shares reserved for issuance under the Companys 2002 Stock
Option Plan (the " _ _2002 Plan__ "), 942,307 Shares reserved for issuance
under the Companys 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan "(the " _ _2006 Plan__ ")
and 2,393,115 Shares reserved for issuance under the Companys 2012 Omnibus
Incentive Plan (the " _ _2012 Plan__ ," and together with the 2002 Plan and
the 2006 Plan, the " _ _Stock__

 



11   _ _Plans__ "), in each case, including pursuant to awards outstanding, the
Company has no Shares reserved for issuance. _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of Company Options,
Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units as of
the close of business on January 3, 2014 outstanding under the Stock Plans,
including, where applicable, the holder, date of grant, term (in the case of
Company Options), number of Shares and, where applicable, exercise price. Each
of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity securities of each
of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by one or more wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge,
security interest, claim or other encumbrance (other than certain Permitted
Tax Liens) (each, a " _ _Lien__ "). " _ _Permitted Tax Liens__ " are liens
that relate to Taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed
upon the Company that are not yet due and payable or that are being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have
been established on the Companys books and records. Except as set forth
above, there are no (A) preemptive or other outstanding rights, options,
warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights,
repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of
any kind that obligate the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries to
issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the
Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or (B) any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving
any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any equity securities of the
Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (the items referred to in
clauses (A) and (B) of or with respect to any Person, collectively, " _
_Rights__ "), and no such Rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.

(ii) Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the
Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens. _Section 3.1(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter lists each Subsidiary of the Company and its
jurisdiction of organization, its authorized capital stock or share capital,
and the number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or share
capital and the record owner(s) thereof. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns beneficially or of record any shares of capital stock or
other Rights in any other Person that is not a Subsidiary of the Company. The
Company is not subject to any obligation or requirement to provide material
funds to or make any material investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in any Subsidiary. Except as set forth above, the
Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the shareholders of the Company on any matter.

 

(iii) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the
voting of the capital stock and other Rights of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(iv) None of the Company Options have been granted in contemplation of the
Merger or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

 



12 (c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement
and, subject only to approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a shareholders
meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the " _ _Company Requisite
Vote__ "), to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of
Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles regardless of whether
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (the " _
_Bankruptcy and Equity Exception__ ").

(ii) The Company Board has (A) determined that the Merger is in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders, adopted, approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions and resolved, subject to
_Section 4.2(d)_, to recommend approval of this Agreement by the holders of
Shares (the " _ _Company Recommendation__ "), (B) directed that this
Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their approval at a
shareholders meeting duly called and held for such purpose and (C) received
the opinion of each of its financial advisors to the effect that the
consideration to be received by the holders of the Shares in the Merger is
fair from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, to such
holders.

amended (the " _ _Securities Act__ "), and in which the Proxy Statement will
be included as a prospectus (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _ _Form S-4__ "), and the declaration of effectiveness of the
Form S-4, (D) under the rules of NASDAQ National Market (" _ _NASDAQ__ ")
and (E) pursuant to any applicable foreign or state securities or blue sky
laws (collectively, clauses (A) through (E), the " _ _Company Approvals__ "),
no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by the Company
with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any Governmental
Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the Transactions, except
those that the failure to make or obtain would not, (x) individually

 



13  or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Change or (y) prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation
of the Transactions.

 

(ii) Assuming compliance with the matters referenced in _Section 3.1(d)(i)_,
receipt of the Company Approvals and the receipt of the Company Requisite
Vote, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not constitute or result
in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Charter or Bylaws of
the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the
creation or acceleration of any obligations pursuant to, any lease, license,
contract, note, mortgage, indenture, agreement, arrangement or other
instrument or obligation (each, a " _ _Contract__ ") binding upon the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C) a violation of, or conflict
with, any Order or Laws to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such
breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change
that, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Change or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the Transactions.

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, (A) its annual report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, (B) its

other statements required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC under
the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since January 1, 2013 (the " _
_Applicable Date__ ") (clauses (A) through (D) collectively, the " _ _Company

respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange

regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Report. As of
its respective date, and, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, no Company Report contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading. As of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments from any comment letters received by the
Company from the SEC relating to reports, statements, schedules, registration
statements or other filings made by the Company with the SEC. The Company has
made available to Parent true and complete copies of all written
comment letters from the staff of the SEC received since January 1, 2010

reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP. No significant deficiency, material weakness or fraud
that involves management or other employees was identified in managements
assessment of internal controls as of December 31, 2012. The Company
maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined by Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by
the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis
to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings
with the SEC to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure within
the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and the Exchange Act
and the Securities Act. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Companys
outside auditors and the Audit Committee of the Company Board all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely

financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that

regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company
Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications were and are
true and complete on the date such certifications were made and as of the date

from federal income tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code, and the
Company is not aware of any circumstances reasonably likely to result in the
loss of the qualification of such Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any fiduciary has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the
taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could
subject any ERISA Plan or any related trust, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any person that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an
obligation to indemnify, to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of

obligations with respect to any Stock Plans or other benefit under any
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company), (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
Company Employee, independent contractor, officer or director, or result in
any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Benefit
Plan, Non-U.S. Benefit Plan or related trust, or (iii) result in any payment
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)

financing used to consummate the Transactions, the Affiliate guarantors of
such debt financing and their respective Subsidiaries. For purposes of this

4.2 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 4.2_, the Company shall
and shall cause each of its Affiliates and its Representatives to: (i)
immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations
with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
and promptly (but in any event within five (5) business days) after the date
of this Agreement, if not already done so prior to the date of this Agreement,
instruct any Person who entered into a confidentiality agreement with the
Company that has not expired or been terminated in connection with any actual
or potential Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all such information or
documents in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement and
(ii) from the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VI_ , not,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information)
any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (B) other than informing Persons of the provisions contained in this
_Section 4.2_, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any non-
public information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, an Acquisition Proposal, or (C) approve, recommend or enter
into, or propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or
similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle (whether
written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 4.2(a)_ or
any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time from and after the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the
Company, directly or indirectly, receives a bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal from any Person, under circumstances not involving any
breach of this _Section 4.2_, if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) in light of such Acquisition
Proposal, the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
constitute a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then the

 



40  Company may, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, (i)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties, assets,
employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to the Person who has made such Acquisition Proposal or
its Representatives or potential sources of financing; _provided_ that the
Company shall not provide any non-public information or access concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person unless such non-public
information and access has been previously provided to, or is substantially
simultaneously provided to, Parent and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives and potential sources of financing regarding
such Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement__ " means any customary confidentiality agreement
that contains provisions that are no less favorable to the Company in any
material respect than those contained in the Confidentiality and Non-
Disclosure Agreement, dated September 23, 2013, between the Company and Parent
(the " _ _Confidentiality Agreement__ ") (including standstill restrictions);
_provided_ that such confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance
by the Company with any of the provisions of this _Section 4.2_.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) notify (which notice shall be provided orally and in writing and
shall identify the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and set forth in
reasonable detail the material terms thereof) Parent after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt) provide copies to Parent of any written proposals, indications
of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall keep Parent informed of any
material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised written
proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such
Acquisition Proposal) on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours) and
upon the request of Parent shall apprise Parent of the status of such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will
not enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with this _Section 4.2_.

 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 4.2(d)_, the Company Board
shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or
publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or
make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer
or exchange offer (other than a recommendation against such offer or a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, in each case that includes a
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation) (it being understood that the
Company Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to such a
tender offer or exchange offer until the close of business as of the tenth
business day after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action being
considered a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), (D) adopt, approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to adopt,

 



41  approve or recommend to shareholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal
or (E) fail to publicly recommend against an Acquisition Proposal and reaffirm
the Company Recommendation within ten (10) business days of the request of
Parent (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change__ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with  _Section 4.2(b)_). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Company
Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company Board may (x) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
6.3(a)_, if, after receiving such bona fide, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal,
the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (I) in light of
such Acquisition Proposal, the failure to so make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of
the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (II) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (1) the
Company has given Parent at least five (5) business days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall include a copy
of the Superior Proposal, a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto and a
written summary of the material terms of any Superior Proposal not made in
writing, including with respect to any financing commitments relating
thereto), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) following
the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good
faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal would
nevertheless continue to be reasonably likely to constitute a Superior
Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect and (4)
in the event of each amendment to the financial terms (including the form,
amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of
such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to
Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1)
above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (1) of this proviso
shall commence, during which time the Company shall be required to comply with
the requirements of this _Section 4.2(d)_ anew with respect to such
additional notice, including clauses (1) through (4) above of this proviso,
except that the new notice period under clause (1) of this proviso shall be
three (3) business days; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company has
complied in all material respect with its obligations under this _Section
4.2_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company Board
may change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly
propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Recommendation (" _ _Intervening Event Recommendation
Change__ "), if, in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to make such
Intervening Event Recommendation

 



42  Change would reasonably be likely to constitute a violation of the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, in such event, shall not be
obligated to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such action shall not be in response to an
Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal (which is addressed under _Section
4.2(d)_) and prior to taking such action, (i) the Company Board has given
Parent at least five (5) business days prior written notice of its intention
to make such Intervening Event Recommendation Change and a reasonable
description of the Intervening Event that serves as the basis of such
Intervening Event Recommendation Change, (ii) the Company has negotiated, and
has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during
such notice period after giving any such notice, to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for making such
Intervening Event Recommendation Change and (iii) at the end of such
notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to make an Intervening Event
Recommendation Change would nevertheless reasonably be likely to constitute a
violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law if the
revisions proposed were to be given effect ( _provided_ that any change to
the material facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event shall
not require a new notice and shall not require such party to further comply
with the requirements of this  _Section 4.2(e)_, including clauses (i)
through (iii) above of this proviso).

(f) Nothing contained in this  _Section 4.2_ or in _Section 4.8_ shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the Companys shareholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in the Company Boards
determination in good faith based after consultation with outside counsel,
the failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to constitute a
violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law or its obligations under applicable federal
securities Law; _provided_ , that any such position or disclosure (other than
any stop, look and listen communication that includes a reaffirmation of the
Company Recommendation) shall be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly and
concurrently reaffirms that Company Recommendation.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Acquisition Proposal__ " means (i)
any inquiry, proposal or offer for or with respect to (or expression of
interest by any Person that it is considering or may engage in) a merger,
joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or
similar transaction involving 15% or more of the total voting power of any
class of equity securities of the Company, (ii) any inquiry, proposal or
offer (including tender or exchange offers) to (or expression by any Person
that it is considering or may seek to) acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, in one or more transactions, 15% or more of the outstanding
Shares or other securities of the Company representing 15% or more of the
total voting power of the Company or (iii) any inquiry, proposal or offer to
(or expression by any Person that it is considering or may seek to) acquire in
any manner (including the acquisition of stock in any Subsidiary of the
Company), directly or indirectly, in one or more transactions, assets or
businesses of the Company or its

 



43  Subsidiaries, including pursuant to a joint venture or partnership,
representing 15% or more of the consolidated total assets (including equity
securities of its Subsidiaries), in each case, other than the Transactions.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Superior Proposal__ " means a bona
fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (i) that if consummated would
result in a third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third
party and the Company, the shareholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 80% of the outstanding Shares or more than
80% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, (ii) that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its outside financial advisors, is reasonably capable of being
completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its outside financial advisors (taking into account any changes to
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal,
and all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the Person making
such proposal, and this Agreement), is more favorable to the shareholders of
the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger and (iv) the
definitive documentation in respect of which does not contain any due
diligence condition.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Intervening Event__ " means a
material event, development, occurrence, state of facts or change that was
not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board on the date of this
Agreement, which event, development, occurrence, state of facts or change
becomes known to the Company Board before the Company Requisite Vote; 
_provided_ , that (i) in no event shall any event, development, occurrence,
state of facts or change that has had or would reasonably be expected to have
an adverse effect on the business, financial condition or operations of, or
the market price of the securities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
constitute an Intervening Event unless such event, development, occurrence,
state of facts or change has had a Parent Material Adverse Change and (ii) in
no event shall the receipt, existence of or terms of an Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiry relating thereto or the consequences thereof constitute an
Intervening Event.

no event more than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this
agreement), (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement and (ii) Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC the Form S-4 in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as necessary
to consummate the Transactions. The Company and Parent will cause the Proxy
Statement to be disseminated to the holders of the Shares as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Subject to _Section
4.2(d)_ and _4.2(e)_ , (i) the Proxy Statement

 



44  will contain the Company Recommendation, and (ii) the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of
the approval of this Agreement and to take all other actions necessary or
advisable to obtain the Company Requisite Vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, each of the Company and Parent (i) shall provide the
other and/or its counsel an opportunity to review and comment on such document
(including the proposed final version of such document), (ii) shall consider
in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the other or their
respective counsels and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond
to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(b) The Company and Parent will provide for inclusion or incorporation by
reference into the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement all reasonably required

written correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand,

reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any such comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy

thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any
stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated. Parent shall also take any other action (other than qualifying to
do business in any jurisdiction in which Parent is not now so qualified)
required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such actions.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent agrees to promptly (i) correct any
information provided by it specifically for use in the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information
provided by it specifically for use in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement to
include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the
statements in the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Company
and Parent further agrees to cause the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement as so
corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to the holders of the Shares (and will use its reasonable efforts
to incorporate any reasonable comments of the other party and/or its counsel
prior to such filing and dissemination), in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Laws.

 



45 4.4 _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company shall take all actions in accordance
with applicable Law, its constituent documents and the rules of NASDAQ to

Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting without
Parents consent; _provided_ that without Parents consent, the Company may
adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting (i) after consultation with

amendment to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement is provided to the shareholders
of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company
Special Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Special Meeting
is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy), to the extent
necessary to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of
the Company Special Meeting or (iii) if the Company has delivered the notice
contemplated by _Section 4.2(d)_ and the time periods contemplated by
_Section 4.2(d)_ have not expired, to the extent necessary so that the
Company Special Meeting shall not be held earlier than five (5) business days
following the time at which such time periods have expired (or such later date

part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Transactions as soon as practicable, including preparing and

after the Effective Time (except in the case of subclause (iii), which shall
be for a period ending on December 31, 2014), Parent will cause the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to provide the Company Employees who
remain employed by the Company and its Affiliates following the Effective

wage, as applicable, that is not less than the base salary or regular hourly

Letter. 

 



48  Until such time as Parent shall cause the Continuing Employees to
participate in the applicable employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or
any Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the " _ _Parent Benefit Plans__ "),
the continued participation of the Continuing Employees in the Benefit Plans
under the terms in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement
shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this clause (it being
understood that participation in Parent Benefit Plans may commence at
different times with respect to each of the Parent Benefit Plans).

 

(b) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees
or their respective beneficiaries and dependents are otherwise eligible to
participate effective as of or at any time following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) recognize all
service of such Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its

pension plan or as would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) waive any
pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence

independent contractor, or Continuing Employee or their respective legal
representatives or beneficiaries or any other Person or (ii) any right to
continued employment with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. Nothing contained in this _Section 4.9_ is intended to
be or shall be considered to be an amendment or adoption of any Benefit Plan,
program, Contract, arrangement or policy of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation nor shall it interfere with
Parents, the Surviving Corporations or any of the Surviving Corporations
Subsidiaries right to amend, suspend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan
_,_ _except as otherwise expressly provided by, and subject to the terms of_

and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.

 

4.11 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Laws, each present and former director and officer of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ ",
and individually, an " _ _Indemnified Party__ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties service
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or services performed by such Indemnified Parties at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the
Transactions. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also pay
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnified Party in
advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws,
_provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides, to the
extent required by applicable Laws, an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the Side A
and Side B coverage parts (directors and officers liability) of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _ _D andO Insurance__") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the Companys existing
policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by
reason of his or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such
six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent
or the Surviving Corporation be required to

 



50  expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
set forth in this  _Section 4.11_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 4.11_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. Parent
shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations under this  _Section 4.11_.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 4.11_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Charter
or Bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable
Contracts or Laws. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby
agree that all provisions relating to exculpation, advancement of expenses
and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of an Indemnified Party as provided in the Charter
or Bylaws of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as of
the date hereof, shall remain in full force and effect for a six-year period
beginning at the Effective Time.

4.12  _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and
the members of their respective boards of directors shall, to the fullest
extent practicable, grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

4.13 _Listing of Shares of Parent Common Stock_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger or reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger to
be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Closing.

 

4.14 _Parent Vote_. Immediately after execution of this Agreement by the
parties hereto, Parent will cause a written consent to be executed by all of
the record holders of the stock of Merger Sub to adopt and approve this
Agreement in accordance with Sections 48-17-104 and 48-21-104 of the TBCA.

 

4.15 _Financing Cooperation_.

Company and each of its Subsidiaries granted in connection therewith shall be,

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 4.15_ to the contrary, in
fulfilling its obligations pursuant to  _Sections 4.15(a)_ and _(b)_ , (i)
none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives shall be required

other liability in connection with any debt and/or equity financing prior to
the Effective Time or (C) require the Company to obtain any third-party audit
other than as obtained in the ordinary course of the Companys business or as
required under  _Section 4.15(a)_,

 



53  (ii) any requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (iii) Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company or cause
the Company to be reimbursed for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses or damages actually suffered or incurred
by them directly in connection with the arrangement of any such financing
(other than to the extent related to information provided by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives).

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent acknowledges and agrees that Closing is not conditioned upon Parent
obtaining any financing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Financing (or in the event any portion or all of the Financing
becomes unavailable or otherwise undesirable, alternative debt or equity
financing (in an amount sufficient, together with the remaining Financing, if
any, and any other sources available to Parent and Company, to fund the
payment of the cash consideration under the Agreement (including the Per Share
Cash Consideration payable hereunder) and the repayment of the Subject
Indebtedness) from the same or other sources) as and to the extent (but
only to the extent) required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to pay the related fees and expenses on the Closing Date.
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing (or replacement thereof). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice (i) upon becoming aware
of any material breach or default by any party to the Financing Commitment or
definitive agreements related to the Financing, (ii) of the receipt of (A) any
notice or (B) other communication, in each case from any Person with respect
to any material breach of any Person of its obligations under the Financing
Commitment or default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Financing Commitment or definitive agreements related to the Financing or any
provisions of the Financing Commitment or definitive agreements related to
the Financing.

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that in the event that the lenders
commitments under the Financing Commitment as in effect on the date hereof
are automatically reduced by an amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds (as
defined in the Financing Commitment in effect as of the date hereof) of
indebtedness for borrowed money or issuances of equity securities by the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the first full paragraph under
Section 1 of the Financing Commitment as in effect as of the date hereof, then
Parent shall (subject to the requirements of Section 2.6 of the Revolving
Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of October 18, 2013, by and among the Parent,
certain Subsidiaries thereof, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as
administrative agent, and the other parties thereto) deposit such Net
Cash Proceeds in a segregated account of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries to
be used to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or for
any other purposes following the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms).

 

(f) If the Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) (a) requires at the Closing the
proceeds of the Financing pursuant to the Financing Commitment in order to
finance any portion of the Transactions and (b) is unable to deliver a third-
party solvency opinion to the Agent (as defined in the Financing Commitment)
in order to satisfy a condition, if any, to the 

 



54  consummation of such Financing, then Parent shall ensure that the amount of
the Dividend (as defined in the Financing Commitment), and the use of the
proceeds thereof, shall be such that delivery of such a solvency opinion is
not a condition to the consummation of the Financing. If Parent (a) reasonably
expects to require at the Closing the proceeds of the Financing pursuant to
the Financing Commitment to finance any portion of the Transactions, then
Parent shall cause 3PD, Inc. and its Subsidiaries not to make or agree to make
any material acquisition of a business or line of business from another person
or entity (other than from the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) or acquire
another person or entity (other than from the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries), or make a non-ordinary course material disposition of assets
(other than to the Investor or any of its Subsidiaries) without the prior
written consent of the Arranger (as defined in the Financing Commitment), in
each case, to the extent that the taking of any such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a failure to satisfy the conditions to the
consummation of such Financing or (b) requires at Closing the proceeds of the
Financing pursuant to the Financing Commitment to finance any portion of the
Transactions, Parent shall cause the conditions specified in Paragraph 10(b)
and (c) of Exhibit C to the Financing Commitment to be satisfied or waived on
or prior to the Closing Date.

4.16 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any Action against the Company
and/or its directors or officers relating to the Transactions and consult with
Parent in connection with material strategic decisions relating to the defense
or settlement of any such Action. Without limitation to _Section 4.1_, the
Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any Action against
the Company and/or any of its directors or officers relating to the
Transactions, without the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

4.17 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys rights
or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (i)
nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

 

4.18 _Section 16 Matters_. Assuming that the Company delivers to Parent, in a
timely fashion prior to the Effective Time, all requisite information
necessary for Parent to take the actions contemplated by this _Section 4.18_,
the Company and Parent each shall take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to ensure that any dispositions of Shares (including derivative
securities related to such stock) resulting from the Merger by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time are
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief, at law or in equity,
that may be available to a party under this Agreement, including monetary
damages in the event that this Agreement is terminated or in the event that
the remedies provided for in this _Section 7.6_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted and (b) nothing contained in this _Section 7.6_
shall require any party to institute any action or proceeding for (or limit
any partys right to institute any action or proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section 7.6_ before exercising any termination right
under _Article VI_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any action or proceeding pursuant to this _Section 7.6_
or anything contained in this _Section 7.6_ restrict or limit any partys
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article
VI_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available
then or thereafter. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and/or other equitable relief
on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby acknowledges and agrees (i) that
it hereby irrevocably waives any requirement for the security or posting of
any bond in connection with such relief and (ii) that the prevailing party in
any such action or proceeding shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs
and expenses associated with seeking such relief, including all attorneys
fees.

7.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto),
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both
written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

 



66 7.9 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) as provided in Section _
4.11_ (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), (b) following
the Effective Time, for the provisions of _Article II_ , (c) for the right of
the Company, on behalf of its shareholders, to pursue damages in the event
of Parents and/or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement, which right is
hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub and (d) for
the Non-Recourse Parties as provided in _Section 6.5(c)_ (Effect
of Termination and Abandonment), Parent and the Company hereby agree that
their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.9_, the Financing
Sources are hereby made third party beneficiaries of _Section 7.5(c)_. The
third-party beneficiary rights referenced in clause (c) of the preceding
sentence may be exercised only by the Company (on behalf of its shareholders
as their agent) through actions expressly approved by the Company Board, and
no shareholder of the Company whether purporting to act in its capacity as a
shareholder or purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on
behalf of the Company, shall have any right or ability to exercise or cause
the exercise of any such right. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto.

7.10  _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

7.11 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such similar Taxes and fees (including penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and
Merger Sub when due.

 

7.12 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

7.13 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Entity declares any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof
to any Person or any circumstance, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the parties
will negotiate in good faith in order to substitute a suitable and equitable
provision therefor in order to carry out as closely as possible, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 



67 7.14 _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part
of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of
the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a
Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be
construed to have the same meaning as the word "shall". The term "or" is not
exclusive.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

 

7.15 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary in
lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall
be deemed references to such other subsidiary, except that
all representations and warranties (other than the representations and
warranties with respect to the number of shares and par value of Merger Sub
common stock set forth in _Section 3.2(h)_ (Capitalization of Merger Sub),
for which Parent may provide updated information as of such date) made in
this Agreement with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement
shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other
subsidiary as of the date of such designation, _provided_ that any such
designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or
otherwise materially impede the rights of the shareholders of the Company
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement
is void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.
