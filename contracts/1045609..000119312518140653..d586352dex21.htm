Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except, in all
cases, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, in
accordance with this _Section 3.1(b)_, including the right, if any, to

like change with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or
Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, outstanding after the date hereof

18  LTIP Units, and (ii) vested Company LTIP Unit eligible for conversion into a
Partnership OP Unit prior to or at the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into a Partnership OP Unit pursuant to the
Partnership Agreement. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding Company LTIP Unit not previously converted into a Partnership
OP Unit, if any, shall be automatically converted into Parent LTIP Units in
an amount equal to the Exchange Ratio, with Parent OP waiving any fees
associated with the conversion of such Company LTIP Units that would otherwise
be payable by the holders of such Company LTIP Units, and, for purposes
of applying the limitation set forth in Section 8.6(H) of the Parent
Partnership Agreement, any Parent LTIP Units issued to a holder of Company
LTIP Units pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as issued on the date
on which the corresponding Company LTIP Units were issued to such holder by
the Partnership. Each holder of Parent LTIP Units shall be admitted as an LTIP

Common Stock that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the
fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock determined immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time over the per share exercise price
of the Company Option, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

 

(d) _Treatment of Company Phantom Shares_. At the Company Merger Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Phantom Share will vest in full and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that any payments or settlement in
respect of Company Phantom Shares shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the award and all payments shall comply with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code.

(e) _Company Equity Incentive Plan_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, the Company and Parent agree that the Company shall, and shall be

appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act
as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment and delivery of the

form issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ equal to the aggregate Merger

sufficient to pay the aggregate Fractional Share Consideration. Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time following the Company Merger Effective Time, any dividends or
other distributions, if any, to which a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock may be entitled pursuant to _Section 3.4(e)_. Such book-entry shares of
Parent Common Stock, aggregate Fractional Share Consideration and the amounts
of any dividends or other distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this _Section 3.4(a)_ are collectively referred to in this
Agreement as the "Exchange Fund". The Exchange Fund shall be for the sole

for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Share and Partnership OP Unit Transfer Books_.

 

(i) From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the unit transfer books of the Partnership or Parent OP of

books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further

after the Company Merger Effective Time, the holders of Certificates (or Book-
Entry Shares) representing ownership shares of the Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall cease
to have rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Companys
transfer agent for any reason shall be exchanged as provided in this _Section
3.4 _with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby.

 



20 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as possible after the Company
Merger Effective Time (but, in any event, no later than three (3) Business
Days following the Company Merger Effective Time), Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) that immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_: (i) a letter of transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal")
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) shall pass
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), to the Exchange Agent, which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such
form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree upon, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in
exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement, together with any amounts payable in respect of the Fractional
Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.8_ and dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.4(e)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Exchange Agent, or to such other agent or agents reasonably
satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III,_ plus any
Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.8_ and any amounts that such holder
has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.4(e)_ to be
mailed or delivered by wire transfer, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the later to occur of (A) the Company Merger Effective Time or (B)
the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof), and the Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) so
surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.4_, each Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) shall
be deemed, at any time after the

 



21  Company Merger Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon
such surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article
III_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender
of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof).

(d) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the
Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration (or any amounts payable in
respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section
3.1(b)_ or distribution to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
3.4(e)_) that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article
III_. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry
Shares shall automatically upon the Company Merger Effective Time be entitled
to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Company Merger Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_, together with any
amounts payable in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance
with _Section 3.8_ and any distribution to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.4(e)_ for each Book-Entry Share. Payment of the Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and distributions with respect
to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such
Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any
cash payable upon the conversion of any Book-Entry Share.

 

(e) _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Company Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
unsurrendered Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions
shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the
Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder in accordance with this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or the conversion of such
Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Company Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Agreement, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Company Merger Effective
Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. At the Company
Merger Effective Time, holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company other than the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_,
together with any amounts payable in respect of the Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.8_ and dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.4(e)_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) representing shares of
Company Common Stock (or automatic conversion in the case of Book-Entry
Shares) in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



22 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any Fractional Share Consideration and any applicable dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock) which remains
undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for six (6)
months after the Company Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock prior to
the Company Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_
shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof
for payment of the Merger Consideration.

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Parent Parties, the Company Parties, the
Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate
thereof, shall be liable to any Person if any portion of the Exchange Fund has
been delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of such holders
or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto.

 

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Parent. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or other income produced by, such investments
shall be paid to Parent. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve
Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this 
_Article III_. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of any of the cash payments contemplated by 
_Section 3.4(e)_ or _Section 3.8_, Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all
times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments in accordance
with _Section 3.4(e) _and _Section 3.8_.

 

Section 3.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, to the
extent required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article
III_.

Section 3.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parties, each of their
respective Representatives and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and the
Fractional Share Consideration (and any other consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement or deemed paid for Tax purposes),

 



23  such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
payments under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. Any such amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.7 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights, or
rights of objecting stockholders under Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL, shall
be available with respect to the Mergers or other transactions contemplated
hereby, including any remedy under Sections 3-201 et seq. of the MGCL.

Section 3.8 _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to
the Company Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share
of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the VWAP of Parent Common Stock.

arrangement or understanding to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party exists or has actually occurred), each of the Company
Parties, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Parent Parties
that:

 

Section 4.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Compliance with Law_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Maryland.  _Section 4.1(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule lists the jurisdictions in which the Company is
duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation. The
Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation
and is in good standing under the Laws of any other jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it therein or in
which the transaction of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or reasonably be expected
to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, operate, lease, hold and encumber its
properties and carry on its business as now conducted.

(b) A true, correct and complete list of each of the Companys Subsidiaries

is listed in _Section 4.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each of the
Company Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited partnership or limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each Company Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification or licensing, except for jurisdictions in

Material Adverse Effect. To the Companys Knowledge, none of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has received written notice that any Permit will be
terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
business. All such Permits are valid and in full force and effect and there
are no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened administrative or
judicial Actions that would reasonably be expected to result in modification,
termination or revocation thereof, except which modification, termination or
revocation would not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since
January 1, 2016, the Company and each Company Subsidiary has been in material
compliance with the terms and requirements of such Permits.

 



30 Section 4.8 _SEC Reports, Financial Statements and Internal Controls_.

 

(a) Each of the Company Parties has, since January 1, 2016, filed with or
otherwise furnished to (as applicable) the SEC on a timely basis all reports,
schedules, forms, registration statements, definitive proxy statements and
other documents required to be filed or furnished by it under the Exchange Act
or the Securities Act (the "Securities Laws"), together with
all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") (such documents, together with any
documents and information incorporated therein by reference, collectively,
the "Company SEC Reports"), all of which were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Laws. As of
their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports (other than preliminary
materials) (a) complied (or with respect to Company SEC Reports filed after
the date hereof, will comply) as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Laws and (b) at the time of filing or
being furnished (or effectiveness in the case of registration statements) did
not (or with respect to Company SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will
not) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been
modified or superseded by later Company SEC Reports filed or furnished and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement and provided that no
representation or warranty is made hereunder as to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
that were not supplied by or on behalf of the Company or the Partnership.
Neither the Company nor the Partnership has any outstanding and unresolved
comments from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Reports. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly
presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the
consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows of the
Company included in or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations, retained earnings or cash flows,
as the case may be, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP and the
applicable rules, accounting requirements and regulations of the SEC
consistently applied during the periods involved, except to the extent such
financial statements have been modified or superseded by later Company SEC
Reports, and except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by
Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act and pursuant to Sections
13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and for normal year-end audit adjustments
which would not be material in amount or effect. With the exception of the
Partnership, no Company Subsidiary is required to file any form or report with
the SEC.

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement, including any contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including any structured

 



31  finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or such Companys or
Company Subsidiarys audited financial statements or other Company SEC
Reports.

(c) There are no liabilities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary of a
nature that would be required under GAAP to be set forth on the financial
statements of the Company or the notes thereto, other than liabilities (i)
adequately provided for on the balance sheet of the Company dated as
of December 31, 2017 (including the notes thereto) as required by GAAP, (ii)
incurred under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) that will be discharged or paid in full prior to
the Closing Date, or (iv) incurred in the ordinary course of business,

(d) Since the end of the Companys most recent audited fiscal year, there
have been no significant deficiencies or material weakness in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated) and no
change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company is not aware
of any change in its internal control over financial reporting that has
occurred since December 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2016, (x) the Company has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to the Company and required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, (y) to the Companys Knowledge, such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of the Company to material
information relating to the Company required to be included in the reports the
Company is required to file under the Exchange Act, and (z) the Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed to the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and
the audit committee of the Company Board (A) all known significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely
to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) any known fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. As of the date of this Agreement, the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder, and the statements contained in all such certifications were, as
of their respective dates made, complete and correct in all material
respects.

under the Laws of the State of Maryland. Parent is duly qualified or licensed
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the Laws
of any other jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it therein or in which the transaction of its business

or reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent
has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, lease, hold
and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now conducted.

 



45 (b) Parent OP is a limited partnership duly formed, validly existing and in

organization. Each Parent Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership
of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification or

Adverse Effect. Each Parent Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority
to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business

Merger, to the filing of the Articles of Merger with the SDAT and, with
respect to the Partnership

proceedings or organizational action on the part of Parent OP are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, subject, with respect to the Partnership Merger, to the filing of the

otherwise furnished to (as applicable) the SEC on a timely basis all reports,
schedules, forms, registration statements, definitive proxy statements and
other documents required to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities
Laws, together with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act (such documents, together with any documents and information incorporated
therein by reference, collectively, the "Parent SEC Reports"), all of which
were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of
the Securities Laws. As of their respective dates, Parent SEC Reports (other
than preliminary materials) (a) complied (or with respect to Parent SEC
Reports filed after the date hereof, will comply) as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Laws and (b) at the time of

date hereof, will not) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent such statements
have been modified or superseded by later Parent SEC Reports filed or
furnished and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement and
provided that no representation or warranty is made hereunder as to statements
made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus that were not supplied by or on behalf of Parent or the
Parent OP. Neither Parent nor Parent OP has any outstanding and unresolved
comments from the SEC with respect to Parent SEC Reports. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
Parent SEC Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements
of income, retained earnings and cash flows of Parent included in or
incorporated by reference into Parent SEC Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations, retained earnings or cash flows, as the case may be, of Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein, in each case in
accordance with GAAP and the applicable rules accounting requirements and
regulations of the SEC consistently applied during the periods involved,
except to the extent such financial statements have been modified or
superseded by later Parent SEC Reports, and except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the
Exchange Act and pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and for
normal year-end audit adjustments which would not be material in amount or
effect. No Parent Subsidiary is required to file any form or report with the
SEC.

(b) None of Parent, Parent OP or any Parent Significant Subsidiary is a party
to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar contract or arrangement, including any
contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent,
Parent OP and any Parent Significant Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate of Parent, Parent OP or any Parent Significant
Subsidiary, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K), where the result,
purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent, Parent OP, any
Parent Significant Subsidiary or such Parents, Parent OPs or Parent
Significant Subsidiarys audited financial statements or other Parent SEC
Reports.

 



51 (c) There are no liabilities of Parent, Parent OP or any Parent Subsidiary of
a nature that would be required under GAAP to be set forth on the financial
statements of Parent or the notes thereto, other than liabilities (i)

31, 2017 (including the notes thereto) as required by GAAP, (ii) incurred
under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) that will be discharged or paid in full prior to the Closing
Date, or (iv) incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with

(d) Since the end of Parents most recent audited fiscal year, there have
been no significant deficiencies or material weakness in Parents internal
control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated) and no change in
Parents internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Parents internal
control over financial reporting. Parent is not aware of any change in its
internal control over financial reporting that has occurred since December
31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, Parents internal control over financial reporting. Since January 1,
2016, (x) Parent has designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by Parent in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to Parents
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure, (y) to Parents Knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in timely alerting the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of Parent to material information required to be included
in the reports Parent is required to file under the Exchange Act, and (z)
Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed to Parents independent registered public accounting firm and the
audit committee of Parent Board (A) all known significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of Parents internal control
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in
any material respect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (B) any known fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting. As of the date
of this Agreement, the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of Parent have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and the statements
contained in all such certifications were, as of their respective dates made,
complete and correct in all material respects.

Section 5.8 _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to Parents
Knowledge, threatened against Parent, Parent OP or any of the Parent
Significant Subsidiaries which has or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of
Parent, Parent OP or any Parent Significant Subsidiary nor any of the Parent
Properties is subject to any outstanding order, writ, judgment, injunction,
stipulation, award or decree of any Governmental Authority which has or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



52 Section 5.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, from January 1, 2018 through the date hereof, Parent, Parent
OP and the Parent Significant Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in
all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

material respects, and (b) has paid (or had paid on their behalf) all

Subsidiaries) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of any Securities Laws. No representation or warranty is made

COVENANTS

 

Section 7.1 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus;
Company Stockholder Meeting; Listing Application_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
(i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare, and cause to be filed with
the SEC, the Form S-4 with respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable in the
Company Merger, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and (ii)
Parent shall prepare and cause to be submitted to the NYSE the
application and other agreements and documentation necessary for the listing
of the Parent Common Stock issuable in the Company Merger on the NYSE. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A)
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act and Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4
effective for so long as necessary to complete the Mergers. Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to have the application for the listing of
the Parent Common Stock accepted by the NYSE as promptly as is practicable
following submission. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to the
other Party any and all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the
holders of its capital stock as may be required or reasonably requested to be
disclosed in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of
the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the preparation and filing of
the NYSE listing application. The Parties shall notify each other promptly of
the receipt of any

 



68  comments from the SEC or the NYSE and of any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
from the NYSE for amendments of supplements to the NYSE listing application
or for additional information. Each Party shall, as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
NYSE, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC or with respect to
the NYSE listing application received from the NYSE and advise the other Party
of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4 received from the SEC or from the NYSE with respect to the NYSE
listing application. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from
the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and to
any comments from the NYSE with respect to the NYSE listing application.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to (1) filing the Form S-4 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC, or
(2) submitting the NYSE listing application to the NYSE or responding to any
comments of the NYSE, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and
provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or
response) and shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments thereon made by the other Party or its counsel and, with respect
to clause (1) above, each of the Company and Parent also shall have consented
to the filing contemplated therein (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall advise the Company, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, (x) of the time of effectiveness of the Form
S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Company Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to have any such stop order or suspension
lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated and (y) of the time the NYSE listing
application is accepted. Parent shall take any other action required to be
taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, NYSE rules and regulations,
any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the Parent
Common Stock in the Company Merger, and the Company shall furnish to Parent
all information concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions. Parent shall also
take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, any
applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the New OP Units in
the Partnership Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company, the Partnership and the holders of the Partnership
OP Units as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.
The Parent Parties shall have the right, to the extent necessary (and
following consultation with the Company), to prepare and file a Form S-4 with
respect to the New OP Units (the "OP Unit Form S-4") to be issued in
connection with the Partnership Merger. The Company Parties will cooperate in
the preparation of the OP Unit Form S-4 pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Parent Parties
determine to prepare and file the OP Unit Form S-4, (I) the Parent Parties
shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such determination, the OP Unit Form S-4, (II) all
references in this Agreement to "Form S-4" (including this _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 8.1(d)_) shall be deemed to refer to the Form S-4 and the OP Unit
Form S-4, collectively.

 



69 (b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any event occurs with respect to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
Parent, Parent OP or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or any change occurs with
respect to other information to be included in the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, which is required to be described in an amendment of,
or a supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the other Party
of such event and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing
with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date on which the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act, the Company shall establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
Companys stockholders for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder
Approval (together with any adjournments or postponements thereof,
the "Company Stockholder Meeting"). The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder
Meeting and to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Company be required to cause the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed prior to the thirty-fifth (35th) day
following the date hereof. The Company Recommendation shall be included in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, unless a Change in
Company Recommendation has occurred in compliance with _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_
or _Section 7.4(b)(v)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 7.1(c)_, if, on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholder
Meeting solely for the purpose of and for the times reasonably necessary to
solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , that the Company Stockholder Meeting is not postponed
or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for
which the Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
postponement or adjournments required by applicable Law) without the consent
of Parent.

Section 7.2 _Other Filings_. In connection with and without limiting the
obligations under _Section 7.1_, as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Parent OP each shall (or shall cause
their applicable Subsidiaries to) use their commercially reasonable efforts
to properly prepare and file any other filings required under the Exchange Act
or any other Law relating to the Mergers (collectively, the "Other Filings").
Each of the Parties shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) promptly
notify the other Parties of the receipt of any comments on, or any request for
amendments or supplements to, any of the Other Filings by the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority or official, and each of the Parties shall supply the
other Parties with copies of all correspondence between it and each of its
Subsidiaries and representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the members
of its staff or any

 



70  other appropriate governmental official, on the other hand, with respect to
any of the Other Filings, except, in each case, that confidential
competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such
exchanges. Each of the Parties shall promptly obtain and furnish the other
Parties with (a) the information which may be reasonably required in order to
make such Other Filings and (b) any additional information which may be
requested by a Governmental Authority and which the Parties reasonably deem
appropriate; _provided_ that the Parties may, as they deem advisable and
necessary, designate any sensitive materials provided to the other under
this  _Section 7.2_ as "outside counsel only" (in which case such materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient without the advance written
consent of the Party providing such materials). Without limiting the
foregoing, each Party shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any request by the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority or official for information, documents or other
materials in connection with the review of the Other Filings or the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) provide to the other Party, and
permit the other Party to review and comment in advance of submission, all
proposed correspondence, filings, and written communications to the SEC or any
other Governmental Authority or official with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. To the extent reasonably practicable,
neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party prior
notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, without giving the other party the opportunity to attend or
participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such
Governmental Authority.

 

Section 7.3 _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, but subject to the obligation to act in good faith, and
subject at all times to the Companys and its directors and Parents and its
directors, as applicable, right and duty to act in a manner consistent with
their duties, each of the Parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the Mergers and to cooperate with
each other in connection with the foregoing, including the taking of such
actions as are necessary to obtain any necessary consents, approvals, orders,
exemptions and authorizations by or from any public or private third party,
including any that are required to be obtained under any Law or any contract,
agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
Parent, Parent OP or any Parent Subsidiary, as applicable, is a party or by
which any of their respective properties or assets are bound, to defend all
lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Mergers, to effect all necessary registrations and Other
Filings and submissions of information requested by a Governmental Authority,
and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be lifted or
rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely
affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the Mergers.

 

Section 7.4 _Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly provided by this Agreement, from and after the date
hereof, the Company shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers

 



71  and directors not to, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and its Subsidiaries other Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information), any
inquiries, indications of interest or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any nonpublic information
or data to any Person relating to, an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiries, proposals, indications of interest or offers that constitute, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company or its Representatives may contact a Person who
has submitted an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal for the
sole purpose of clarifying the terms of such Acquisition Proposal in
connection with determining whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or
would reasonably be likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, prior to any such contact, the Company must comply with its
obligations under _Section 7.4(b)(ii)_ with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal and must disclose to Parent the terms that the Company and its
Representatives are seeking to have clarified by such Person, (iii) approve or
execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or
other similar agreement providing for any Acquisition Proposal (an
"Acquisition Agreement"), or (iv) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section 7.4(a)_ shall not prohibit the
Company or its Representatives from informing any Third Party of the terms of
this _Section 7.4_ and referring such Third Party to any publicly-available
copy of this Agreement.

 

(b)(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board shall be permitted to take the following actions, prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting, in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal by such Person made after the date of this Agreement
(provided that the Acquisition Proposal by such Person did not result from a
breach of _Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.4(c)_) and which the Company Board
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
its financial advisors) either constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal, if the Company Board concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with their duties as directors under applicable Law: (A)
engage in discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal
with the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, and (B) provide any
nonpublic information or data to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal
after entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to taking any of the actions described in
the immediately preceding clause (A) and clause (B), the Company must comply
with its obligations under _Section 7.4(b)(ii)_ with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal and must notify Parent that it intends to take such
action with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of any nonpublic information or data provided to the
Person who made such Acquisition Proposal prior to or simultaneously with
furnishing such information to such Person to the extent such nonpublic
information or data has not been previously provided to Parent. For purposes
of this _Section 7.4(b)_, an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a
confidentiality agreement between the Company, on the one hand, and a
counterparty, on the other hand, having confidentiality and use provisions
that are no more favorable to such counterparty than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such confidentiality agreement shall not contain any standstill.

 



72 (ii) The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent orally, and promptly thereafter in writing, of the
receipt by the Company, the Company Board or any of their respective
Representatives of any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making such
inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer, and the material terms and
conditions of, such inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer
(including a copy thereof if in writing and any material documentation or
correspondence that sets forth any such terms). The Company shall (A) promptly
(but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent, orally and
promptly thereafter in writing, of any changes or modifications to the
material terms of the Acquisition Proposal and (B) keep Parent informed on
a reasonably current basis regarding material developments, discussions and
negotiations concerning any such Acquisition Proposal.

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section 7.4(b)(v)_,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to the Parent Parties the
Company Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal, (C) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, (D) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal
subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act in any
solicitation or recommendation statement made on Schedule 14D-9 within ten
(10) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing, (E) if an Acquisition
Proposal or any material modification thereof is made public or is otherwise
sent to the holders of Company Common Stock, fail to issue a press release or
other public communication that reaffirms the Company Recommendation within
ten (10) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing, (F) authorize,
cause or permit the Company or any of its Affiliates to enter into any
Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.4(b)(i)_), or (G) propose, resolve or agree to
take any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (A) through (F) (any action
set forth in this _Section 7.4(b)(iii)_, a "Change in Company
Recommendation").

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal and at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Change in Company
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_, if
and only if (A) an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
(provided that the Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of
_Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.4(c)_) is made to the Company and is not
withdrawn, (B) the Company Board has concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C)
the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with their duties as directors under applicable Law, (D) four (4) Business
Days (the "Notice Period") shall have elapsed since the Company has given
written notice to Parent advising Parent that the Company intends to take
such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor,
including the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal that
is the basis of the proposed action 

 



73  (a "Superior Proposal Notice"), which Superior Proposal Notice shall not be
deemed a Change in Company Recommendation for any purpose of this Agreement,
(E) during such Notice Period, the Company has considered and, if requested
by Parent, engaged and caused its Representatives to engage in good faith
discussions with Parent regarding any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and (F) the Company Board, following
such Notice Period, again concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent)
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with their duties as directors
under applicable Law and that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) if, during
the Notice Period, any material revisions are made to the Superior Proposal
(it being understood that a material revision shall include any change in the
purchase price or form of consideration in such Superior Proposal),
the Company Board shall give a new Superior Proposal Notice to Parent prior
to the expiration of the Notice Period and shall comply in all respects with
the requirements of this _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ and the Notice Period shall
thereafter expire on the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the
date of the delivery of such new Superior Proposal Notice ( _provided_ that
the delivery of a new Superior Proposal Notice shall in no event shorten the
four (4) Business Day duration applicable to the initial Notice Period) and
(2) in the event the Company Board does not determine in accordance with the
immediately preceding _clause (F)_ that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, but thereafter determines to make a Change in Company
Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(e) _with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(whether from the same or different Person), the foregoing procedures referred
to in this _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ shall apply anew.

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
circumstances not involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal and at any
time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board may make a Change in Company Recommendation if and only if (A) an
Intervening Event has occurred, (B) the Company Board has concluded in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with their duties as directors under
applicable Law, (C) four (4) Business Days (the "Intervening Event
Notice Period") shall have elapsed since the Company has given written notice
(which written notice shall not be deemed a Change in Company Recommendation
for any purpose of this Agreement) to Parent advising that the Company intends
to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor,
(D) during such Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company has considered
and, if requested by Parent, engaged and caused its Representatives to engage
in good faith discussions with Parent regarding any adjustment or
modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and (E) the
Company Board, following such Intervening Event Notice Period, again
reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors, and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent)
that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their duties as directors
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Company
Board does not make a Change in Company Recommendation following such
Intervening Event Notice Period, but thereafter determines to make a Change in
Company Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)(v)_ in circumstances
not involving an Acquisition Proposal, the foregoing procedures referred to in
this _Section 7.4(b)(v)_ shall apply anew.

 



74 (vi) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit the Company or
its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, from (A) taking and disclosing to
its respective stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making a statement contemplated
by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, (B) making any other disclosure to its stockholders with regard
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board reasonably determines (after consultation with its
outside counsel) is required by applicable Law or (C) issuing a "stop, look
and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such disclosure that addresses the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to
be a Change in Company Recommendation unless the Company Board in connection
with such communication publicly states that the Company Recommendation has
not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the Company, without
disclosing any Change in Company Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Company Board may not make a Change in Company Recommendation unless in
compliance with _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section 7.4(b)(v)_.

 

(c) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees that it will and will
cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their Representatives to, (i) cease
immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Third Parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) terminate any such Third Partys access to
any physical or electronic data rooms and (iii) request that any such Third
Party and its Representatives (A) destroy or return all confidential
information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries furnished by or
on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and (B) destroy
all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that
contain, reflect or analyze such confidential information, in the case of the
foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), to the extent required by and in accordance
with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement between the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries and such Person. The Company agrees that it
will promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives of
the obligations undertaken in this _Section 7.4_. Any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.4_ by any officer, director or
investment banker of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed
to be a breach of this _Section 7.4_ by the Company for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any Change in Company Recommendation, unless such Change
in Company Recommendation is with respect to a Superior Proposal and this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_, the Company shall cause
the approval of the Company Mergers to be submitted to a vote of its
stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

(e) Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby is the only matter, other than any say-on-golden parachute vote that
may be required pursuant to Section 14A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14a-21(c) thereunder and a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies, in the event
there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting
to obtain the approval of the Companys stockholders, which the Company shall
propose to be acted on by its stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



75 (f) The Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Mergers prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

Section 7.5 _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_. 

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent (the
"Indemnifying Party") shall, for a period of six (6) years from the Company
Merger Effective Time: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at
the date hereof, was previously, or is during any of the period from the date
hereof until the Company Merger Effective Time, serving as a manager,
director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and acting in such capacity (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") to the fullest extent that a Maryland corporation is permitted to
indemnify and hold harmless its own such Persons under the applicable Laws of
the State of Maryland, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any
Claim with respect to matters occurring on or before the Company Merger
Effective Time and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim
Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from
such Claim; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the
Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent that a Maryland corporation is
permitted to indemnify and hold harmless its own such Persons under the
applicable Laws of the State of Maryland, as now or hereafter in effect, any
Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating with respect to any Claim in advance of the
final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security, but subject to Parents receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it
is ultimately determined under applicable Laws or any of the Company
Governing Documents that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, any Indemnified Party
delivers to Parent a written notice asserting that indemnification is required
in accordance with this _Section 7.5_ with respect to a Claim, then the
provisions for indemnification contained in this  _Section 7.5_ with respect
to such Claim shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Company Merger
Effective Time and shall continue to apply until such time as such Claim is
fully and finally resolved. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in, or seek termination
with respect to, any actual or threatened Claim in respect of which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless
such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out of such Claim. No
Indemnified Party shall be liable for any amounts paid in any settlement
effected without its prior express written consent.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parent Parties agrees that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time now
existing in favor of the current or former

 



76  directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Governing Documents and
indemnification or similar agreements of the Company shall survive the
Company Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or modified in a manner
adverse to the Indemnified parties, for a period of six (6) years following
the Company Merger Effective Date; _provided_ that if, at any time prior to
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, any
Indemnified Party delivers to Parent a written notice asserting
that indemnification is required in accordance with this _Section 7.5_ with
respect to a Claim, then the provisions for indemnification contained in this
_Section 7.5_ with respect to such Claim shall survive the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time and shall continue to apply
until such time as such Claim is fully and finally resolved.

 

(c) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and
fully pay the premium for, and Parent shall maintain in full force and effect
(and the obligations under to be honored), during the six (6) year period
beginning on the date of the Company Merger Effective Time, a "tail" prepaid
directors and officers liability insurance policy or policies (which policy
or policies by their respective express terms shall survive the Mergers) from
the Companys current insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries existing directors and officers
liability policy or policies for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance for Claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
aggregate premium payable for such "tail" insurance policy exceed an amount
equal to 250% of the annual premium paid by the Company for its
directors and officers liability insurance as set forth in _Section
7.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (such amount being the "Maximum
Premium"). If the Company is unable to obtain the "tail" insurance described
in the first sentence of this _Section 7.5(c)_ for an amount equal to or less
than the Maximum Premium, Company shall be entitled to obtain as much
comparable "tail" insurance as reasonably available for an aggregate cost
equal to the Maximum Premium.

(d) If any of Parent or its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving company, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section
7.5_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.5_ are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and other
Person referred to in this _Section 7.5_ (who are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_), his or her heirs and his or her
personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent and the Company, and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse
to the Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, assigns and heirs)
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (including the
successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The exculpation and
indemnification provided for by this _Section 7.5_ shall be in

 



77  addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or exculpation which an Indemnified Party and other Person
referred to in this _Section 7.5_ is entitled, whether pursuant to
applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

Section 7.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
contracts, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i)
furnish Company or Parent, as applicable, with such financial and operating
data and other information with respect to the business, properties, offices,
books, contracts, records and personnel of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or Parent, Parent OP and Parent Subsidiaries, as applicable, as
the Company or Parent, as applicable, may from time to time reasonably
request, (ii) with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
subject to the terms of the Company Leases, facilitate reasonable access for
Parent and its authorized Representatives during normal business hours, and
upon reasonable advance notice, to all Company Properties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall
affect or be deemed to modify any of the representations or warranties made by
the Company Parties or the Parent Parties, as applicable, hereto and all such
access shall be coordinated through the Company or Parent, as applicable, or
its respective designated Representatives, in accordance with such reasonable
procedures as they may establish. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor Parent shall be required by this  _Section 7.6_ to provide the
other Party or the Representatives of such other Party with access to or to
disclose information (A) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a Third Party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice (if the Company or Parent, as
applicable, has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission
or consent of such Third Party to such disclosure), (B) the disclosure of
which would violate any Law or legal or contractual duty of the Party or any
of its Representatives, (C) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege or would cause a risk of a loss of
privilege to the disclosing Party or (D) if it reasonably determines that such
access is reasonably likely to materially disrupt, impair or interfere with
its, or its Subsidiaries, business or operations; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Parties will work in good faith to determine a means to provide
access that will not materially disrupt, impair or interfere with such
business or operations. Each of the Company and Parent will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses
of the other Party that may result from the requests for access, data and
information hereunder. Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, each
of the Company Parties and each of the Parent Parties shall not, and shall
cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or
otherwise communicate with parties with which the other Party has a
business relationship (including tenants/subtenants) regarding the business
of such other Party or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of such other Party (provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.6(a)_ shall be deemed to
restrict a Party and its respective Representatives and Affiliates from
contacting such parties in pursuing its own business activities (operating in
the ordinary course)).

 

(b) Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, each of the Company and
Parent shall hold, and will cause its respective Representatives and
Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ in

 



78  confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will
otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
remain in full force and effect pursuant to the terms thereof notwithstanding
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the termination thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Section 7 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate and be of no further force or effect. 

Section 7.7 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Change in
Company Recommendation or any action taken by the Company or the Company
Board pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.4_, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, the Company and Parent shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements or
filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and, except as otherwise permitted or required by this
Agreement, none of the Company or the Parent shall issue any such press
release or make any such public statement or filing prior to obtaining the
consent of the other Party(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may, without
the prior consent of the other Parties, issue any such press release or make
any such public statement or filing as may be required by Law, order or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if (a) for any
reason it is not reasonably practicable to consult with the other Party
before making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) the Party issuing such
press release or making such public statement has used its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party and to obtain such Partys
consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner through no fault of
such issuing Party.

 

Section 7.8 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing and ending on the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing (or if earlier, the date of the
employees termination of employment with Parent, Parent OP and the Parent
Subsidiaries), Parent shall, and shall cause each Parent Subsidiary (including
the Partnership and Parent OP), as applicable, to, provide each individual
who is an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior
to the Closing and who remains employed by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (including the Partnership and
Parent OP) immediately following the Closing (each a "Continuing Employee"
and collectively, the "Continuing Employees") with compensation and benefits,
that are mutually agreed between the Parent Parties and each such
Continuing Employee.

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause Parent OP and the Parent Subsidiaries to,
provide credit for each Continuing Employees length of service with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit level under any vacation, severance or
paid time-off arrangement (but not for purposes of any benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plan) under each plan, program, policy, agreement
or arrangement of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries (including the Partnership
and Parent) to the same extent that such service was recognized under a
similar plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, except that no such prior service credit will be required
or provided to the extent that (i) it results in a duplication of benefits,
or (ii) such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company
Employee Program.

 



79 (c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall use, and shall
cause the Surviving Entity to use, commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each Company Employee Program in which any Continuing Employee participates
that provides health or welfare benefits to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and service conditions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Continuing Employees, other than limitations applicable under the
corresponding Company Employee Program or to the extent that such pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable
Company Employee Program and (ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses
of Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) that were applied
toward the deductible and out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding
Company Employee Program in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-
pocket maximums or co-payments under a corresponding Company Employee Program
during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

(d) During the Interim Period, the Parent Parties and the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall, and agree to cause their applicable Affiliates to,
cooperate with each other to accomplish the matters addressed by this _Section
7.8_ and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries agree, upon the reasonable
request of Parent, to assist the Parent Parties with respect post-closing
employment matters relating to employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 7.8_ shall (i) confer any rights upon any
Person, including any Continuing Employee or former employee of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, other than the Parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii) constitute or create
an employment agreement or create any right in any Continuing Employee or any
other Person to any continued employment or service with or for the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, Parent OP, the Parent Subsidiaries, or the
Surviving Entity, or to any compensation or benefits of any nature or
kind whatsoever, (iii) constitute or be treated as an amendment,
modification, adoption, suspension or termination of any Company Employee
Program, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, Parent, Parent OP, the Parent Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Entity, or (iv) alter or limit the ability of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, Parent, Parent OP, the Parent Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Entity to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them.

 

Section 7.9 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts (before and, as relevant, after the Company Merger
Effective Time) to cause the Company Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Provided the Company shall
have received the opinion of counsel referred to in  _Section 8.3(e)_ and
Parent shall have received the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section
8.2(e)_,

 



80  the Parties shall treat the Company Merger as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code and no Party shall take any position for Tax
purposes inconsistent therewith, except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related
interests, penalties or additions to Tax, "Transfer Taxes"), and shall
cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. Subject to 
_Section 6.3_, from and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the
Parent Parties shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding
from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, Partnership OP Units or Company LTIP Units, all Transfer Taxes.

(c) Each of Parent and its Affiliates covenants and agrees that from
and after the Closing it will, or will cause its Affiliates to take all
actions, or forbear from taking all actions, within its control, as necessary
to ensure that each of the Company and Parent will be classified as a REIT for
the taxable year of such entity that includes the Closing Date, and will not
take or permit any of its Subsidiaries to take, within their control, any
action which is inconsistent with such REIT qualification. The Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to cause each TRS of the Company to jointly elect
with Parent to be treated as a TRS of Parent, effective as of the Closing
Date.

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent OP agrees to file
composite state income Tax Returns for its taxable year in which the Closing
occurs covering all holders of New OP Units and all holders of Parent LTIP
units issued pursuant to _Section 3.3_ who elect in writing to be included
in such composite state income Tax Returns. In connection with the foregoing,
Parent OP will send election materials to all holders of New OP Units and all
holders of Parent LTIP Units issued pursuant to  _Section 3.3_ for which it
has valid contact information in the same form and at the same time as such
materials are sent to the other limited partners of Parent OP. Parent OP
currently plans and intends to offer the same opportunity for subsequent
taxable years, in which case holders of New OP Units and all holders of Parent
LTIP Units issued pursuant to _Section 3.3_ will be offered the opportunity
to be included in Parent OPs composite state income Tax Returns to the same
extent that such opportunity is offered to the other limited partners of
Parent OP.

(e) Parent OP shall adopt the "traditional method" as set forth in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-3 (and any analogous provision of state or local
income tax law) with respect to any variation between the adjusted tax basis
and fair market value, as of the Partnership Merger Effective Time, of any of
the Company Properties or any other assets deemed transferred by the
Partnership to Parent OP for federal income tax purposes.

 

(f) During the Interim Period the Parties will cooperate in good faith to
negotiate transactions acceptable to both the Company and Parent in their
sole discretion, which may include: (i) identifying certain assets that the
Parties may desire to be purchased by one or

 



81  more Parent Subsidiaries or the Affiliates of the Parent Parties from one or
more Company Subsidiaries during the Interim Period as part of one or more
"like-kind exchanges" under Section 1031 of the Code by such Parent
Subsidiaries, (ii) identifying certain assets that the Parties may desire to
be purchased by one or more Company Subsidiaries from one or more Parent
Subsidiaries or the Affiliates of the Parent Parties during the Interim
Period as part of one or more "like-kind exchanges" under Section 1031 of the
Code by such Company Subsidiaries, and (iii) in each case causing such
purchases or sales to be completed during the Interim Period pursuant to such
terms as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company, in their sole discretion,
and as may be necessary for such purchases or sales to constitute part of one
or more like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code. Notwithstanding
or in limitation of the foregoing, no Party shall be required to negotiate or
consummate any transaction contemplated by this _Section 7.9(f)_ that such
Party determines in its sole discretion may adversely affect such Party or,
in the case of the Company, the holders of Partnership OP Units or, in the
case of Parent, the holders of Parent Partnership Units.

 

Section 7.10 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_

 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received
by such Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Promptly after becoming aware, the Company shall give written notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give written notice to Company, if (i) any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes
untrue or inaccurate such that, if uncured, it would be reasonably expected
to result in any of the applicable closing conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ not being capable of being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date; or (ii) it
fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement such that, if uncured, it would result in any of the applicable
closing conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ not to be satisfied; _provided_
, _however_ , that no such notification (or failure to give such
notification) shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
if, to the Companys Knowledge or the Parents Knowledge, as applicable, the
occurrence of any state of facts or Event would cause, or would reasonably be
expected to cause, any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article
VIII_ not to be satisfied or satisfaction to be reasonably delayed.

aside any dividend or other distribution to its respective stockholders
without the prior written consent of Parent (in the case of the Company) or
the Company (in the case of Parent); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
written consent of the other Party shall not be required (but written notice
shall be given) for (i) in the case of the Company, the authorization and

regular distributions that are required to be made in respect of the
Partnership OP Units and Company LTIP Units in connection with any dividends
paid on the shares of the Company Common Stock and (ii) in the case of Parent,
for the authorization and payment of quarterly distributions at a rate not in

avoidance of doubt, the regular distributions that are required to be made in
respect of the Parent OP Units in connection with any dividends paid on the

the Closing Date, then the holders of Company Common Stock and the holders of
Parent Common Stock, respectively, shall also receive a distribution for such
quarter, whether in full or pro-rated for the applicable quarter, as necessary
to result in the holders of Company Common Stock and the holders of Parent
Common Stock receiving dividends covering the same periods prior to the
Closing Date and (B) the Parties will cooperate such that any such quarterly
distribution by the Company and Parent shall have the same record date and the
same payment date in order to ensure that the stockholders of the Company and
the stockholders of Parent receive the same number of such dividends prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent, as applicable, shall be permitted
to declare and pay a dividend to its stockholders, the record date and payment
date for which shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior
to the Closing Date, distributing any amounts determined by such Party (in
each case in consultation with the other Party) to be the minimum dividend
required to be distributed in order for such Party to qualify as a REIT and to
avoid to the extent reasonably possible the incurrence of income or excise Tax
(any dividend paid pursuant to this paragraph, a "REIT Dividend").

(c) If either Party determines that it is necessary to declare a REIT
Dividend, it shall notify the other Party at least 20 days prior to the date
of the Company Stockholder Meeting and such other Party shall be entitled to
declare a dividend per share payable (i) in the case of Company, to holders
of Company Common Stock, in an amount per share of Company Common Stock equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the REIT Dividend declared by Parent
with respect to each share of Parent Common Stock by (B) the Exchange Ratio
and (ii) in the case of Parent, to holders of Parent Common Stock, in an
amount per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the REIT
Dividend declared by the Company with respect to each share of Company Common
Stock and (y) the Exchange Ratio. The record date and payment date for any
dividend payable pursuant to this _Section 7.18(c)_ shall be the close of
business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

best efforts to cause the resale of the Parent Common Stock that may be
issued upon redemption of the New OP Units to be included on its existing
registration statement promptly following the Closing (but, in any event, on
or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after the Closing Date).

agreements contained in _Section 7.6(b)_ (Confidentiality), _Section 7.7_
(Public Announcements), this _Section 9.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Section
9.3_ (Termination Fees and Expense Amount), _Section 9.4_ (Payment of
Expense Amount or Termination Fee) and _Article X_ (General Provisions) and
the definitions of all defined terms appearing in such sections shall survive
any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except as set forth in this _Section 9.2_, nothing shall
relieve any Party from liabilities or damages arising out of any fraud or
Willful Breach by such Party of this Agreement. If this Agreement is
terminated as provided herein, all filings, applications and other submissions
made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn
from the Governmental Authority or other Person to which they were made.

Section 9.3 _Termination Fees and Expense Amount_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant
to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or  _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(c)_, and, after the date hereof and prior to the termination of
this Agreement, the Company (i) receives or has received a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company that has been publicly
announced or otherwise communicated to the Company Board prior to the time of
the Company Stockholder Meeting (with respect to a termination under _Section
9.1(b)(i)_) or prior to the date of termination of this Agreement (with
respect to a termination under _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section 9.1(c)_),
and (ii) before the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of
termination of this Agreement, the Company consummates an Acquisition
Proposal or enters into an Acquisition Agreement, then the Company shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Parent, subject to the provisions of _Section
9.4(a)_, the Termination Fee minus, if previously paid pursuant to _Section
9.3(c)_, the Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated by Parent, not later than the earlier of consummation of such
transaction arising from such Acquisition Proposal or the execution of such
Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
_Section 9.3(a)_, the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty (50%)".

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company pursuant to _Section
9.1(e) _or (ii) Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_, then, in each case, the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent, subject to the provisions
of _Section 9.4(a)_, the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds
to an account designated by Parent, within two (2) Business Days of such
termination.

 



92 (c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_, the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Expense Amount, by wire
transfer to an account designated by Parent, within two (2) Business Days
after the date of such termination.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that:

 

(i) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee or the Expense Amount on more than one occasion; and

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company
is required to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ or
_Section 9.3(b)_ and the Termination Fee is paid to Parent (or its designee),
the payment of the Termination Fee will be the Parent Parties sole and
exclusive remedy against the Company Parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of this
Agreement by any of the Company Parties.

 

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination Fee nor the Expense Amount is
a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee or amount is due and
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which fee or amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and (iii) without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this  _Section 9.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 9.3_, such that the Company
shall pay Parent its costs and Expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ on the date of payment
for the period from the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 9.4 _Payment of Expense Amount or Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that the Company is obligated to pay Parent the Expense
Amount and/or Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent from the
Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee deposited into escrow in accordance with
the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Expense Amount
and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, and (ii) the sum of (A) the
maximum amount that can be paid to Parent (or its designee) without causing
Parent (or its designee) to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2)(A) through (H) or 856(c)(3)(A) through (I) of the Code

 



93  ("Qualifying Income"), as determined by Parents independent certified
public accountants, plus (B) in the event Parent receives either (1) a letter
from Parents counsel indicating that Parent has received a ruling from the
IRS described in _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_ or (2) an opinion from Parents outside
counsel as described in _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_, an amount equal to the excess
of the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, less the amount
payable under clause (A) above. To secure the Companys obligation to pay
these amounts, the Company shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash
equal to the Expense Amount or the Termination Fee, as applicable, with an
escrow agent selected by the Company and on such terms (subject to _Section
9.4(b)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the
escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Expense Amount or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 9.4(a)_ shall be
made at the time the Company is obligated to pay Parent such amount pursuant
to _Section 9.3_ by wire transfer or bank check.

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense Amount or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be
released to Parent (or its designee) unless the escrow agent receives any one
or combination of the following: (i) a letter from Parents independent
certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid
by the escrow agent to Parent (or its designee) without causing Parent (or its
designee) to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from Parents accountants revising
that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to
Parent (or its designee), or (ii) a letter from Parents counsel indicating
that Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent
(or its designee) of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as
applicable, would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded
from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code (or alternatively, indicating that Parents outside counsel has rendered
a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent (or its designee) of
the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the
escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Expense Amount and/or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, to Parent (or its designee). The Company
agrees to amend this _Section 9.4(b)_ at the request of Parent in order to
(x) maximize the portion of the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as
applicable, that may be distributed to Parent (or its designee) hereunder
without causing Parent (or its designee) to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve Parents chances of
securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 9.4(b)_ or (z) assist
Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as
described in this _Section 9.4(b)_. The escrow agreement shall also provide
that any portion of the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable,
that remains unpaid as of the end of the taxable year shall be paid as soon as
possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this _Section 9.4_; _provided_ , that the obligation of the
Company to pay the unpaid portion of the Expense Amount and/or Termination
Fee, as applicable, shall terminate on the December 31 following the date
which is five (5) years from the date of this Agreement and any such unpaid
portion shall be released by the escrow agent to the Company. The Company
shall not be a party to such escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of
or have liability resulting from the escrow agreement.

 



94 (c) Except at set forth in _Section 9.3_ and this _Section 9.4_, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees and
expenses whether or not the Mergers are consummated.

 

Section 9.5 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties, at any time before or after the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained; provided, however, that after the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, no amendment shall be made which by Law
requires further approval by such stockholders without obtaining such
approval.

Section 9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, the Parties may to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other Parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto, and (c) waive compliance by any other Party with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party against which such waiver or
extension is to be enforced. The failure of a Party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.

Section 10.3 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_. Except for _Article II_ and  _Article III_, _Section 7.5_ and

person other than the Parties or their respective heirs, successors,
executors, administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is 

 



97  invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 10.7 _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The Partnership Merger shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of

the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Maryland without regard to
its rules of conflict of laws.

 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to and

any inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to request and/or consent to the assignment of any such
proceeding to the Maryland Courts Business and Technology Case Management
Program. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect the rights of any
Party to pursue appeals from any judgments or order of the Maryland Court as

appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland as such Partys agent
for acceptance of legal process, and (ii) that service of process may also be
made on such Party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt

service. Service made pursuant to (i) or (ii) above shall have the same legal
force and effect as if served upon such Party personally within the State of
Maryland.

Section 10.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and
the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Except as set forth in this
_Section 10.8_, it is agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article IX_ the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any other
Party and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 



98 (c) The Parties right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to the grant of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of
this Agreement by any other Party (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity), and each Party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 10.8(c)_. In the event any Party seeks an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such Party shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction all in accordance with the terms of this _Section
10.8(c)_.

Section 10.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Party (including by means of electronic
delivery). Facsimile and electronic .pdf transmission of any signed original
document shall be deemed the same as delivery of an original.

THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 10.10_.

Section 10.11  _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language of
this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any

regard to events of authorship or negotiation.
