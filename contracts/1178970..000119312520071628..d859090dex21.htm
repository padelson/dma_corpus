Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time:
(a) SBBX shall merge with and into PFS, with PFS as the resulting or
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"); and (b) the separate
existence of SBBX shall cease and all of the rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, properties, assets, liabilities and obligations of SBBX shall be
vested in and assumed by the Surviving Corporation. As part of the Merger,
each share of SBBX Common Stock (other than the Exception Shares) will be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
terms of Article III hereof.

2.2. _Effective Time._

 

The closing ("Closing") shall be that date and time (the "Closing Date")
selected by PFS upon no less than two business days written notice to SBBX,

following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law)
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article IX (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of those
conditions), or such other date and time that may be mutually agreed to in
writing by the parties. On or before the Closing Date, PFS and SBBX,
respectively, shall cause to be filed (i) a certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL
and (ii) a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
New Jersey. The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time
specified in the certificates of merger (such date and time, the "Effective
Time"). 

2.3. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._

2.5. _Effects of the Merger._

 

At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects as set
forth in the DGCL and the NJBCA.

 

2.6. _Tax Consequences._

 

It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and
361 of the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
Closing, each party hereto shall use its best efforts to cause the Merger
to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be
taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which
action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Closing,
neither PFS, nor any of its affiliates, shall knowingly take any action, cause
any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to
be taken, which action or failure to act could cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

2.7. _Additional Actions._

If, at any time after the Effective Time, PFS shall consider or be advised
that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts
are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in PFS its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of SBBX, or (ii) otherwise carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, SBBX and its officers and directors shall be
deemed to have granted to PFS an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and
deliver, in such official corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments or
assurances in law or any other acts as are necessary or desirable to (a)
vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in PFS its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of SBBX or
(b) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of PFS are authorized in the name of SBBX or otherwise to take any
and all such action.

2.8. _Alternative Structure_.

 

PFS may, at any time prior to the Effective Time, change the method of
effecting the combination of PFS and SBBX, and Provident Bank and SB
One Bank, respectively, (including the provisions of this Article II) if and
to the extent it deems such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable;
_ provided_, ___however_ , that no such change shall (a) alter or change the
Merger Consideration; (b) adversely affect the tax treatment of SBBXs
shareholders pursuant to this Agreement; (c) adversely affect the tax
treatment of PFS or SBBX pursuant to this Agreement; or (d) be
reasonably likely to materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event PFS makes such a
change, SBBX agrees to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in
order to reflect such change.

 

2.9. _Bank Merger._

Certificate") immediately following the Effective Time.

ARTICLE III

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES

 

3.1. __ __ __ __ _Conversion of SBBX Common Stock; Merger Consideration._

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of PFS, SBBX or the holders of any of the shares of SBBX Common Stock,
the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:

3.1.1. Each share of PFS Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

3.1.2. Each share of SBBX Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is held by SBBX as treasury stock or held by
SBBX, any Subsidiary of SBBX, PFS or any Subsidiary of PFS (all such shares of
SBBX Common Stock, but excluding shares of SBBX Common Stock held in any
employee benefit plans or related trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual
funds and the like or otherwise held in any fiduciary or agency capacity or
as a result of debts previously contracted, the "Exception Shares") shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be paid or provided with respect thereto.

3.1.3. Subject to Section 3.1.4, each share of SBBX Common Stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Exception Shares but including SBBX Restricted Stock) shall be converted
into the right to receive 1.357 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of PFS Common Stock (the "Merger
Consideration"). Each share of SBBX Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any
such shares of SBBX Common Stock (each, an "Old Certificate", it being
understood that any reference herein to "Old Certificate" shall be deemed to
include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of shares of SBBX Common Stock) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (x) the Merger Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, this
Section 3.1.3 and

 



9

    

 the other terms of this Article III, (y) cash in lieu of fractional shares
that the shares of SBBX Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have
been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 3.1.3 and
Section 3.1.4, without any interest thereon, and (z) any dividends or
distributions that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.2.3, in the case of each of the foregoing, without interest and
subject to all applicable withholding of Tax in accordance with Section 3.2.7.
Old Certificates previously representing shares of SBBX Common Stock shall be
exchanged for evidence of shares in book-entry form or, at PFSs option,
certificates (collectively, referred to herein as "New Certificates"),
representing the Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares
issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such Old Certificates
in accordance with Section 3.2.1, without any interest thereon and subject to
all applicable withholding of Tax in accordance with Section 3.2.7.

3.1.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of PFS Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to PFS Common Stock shall be payable on
or with respect to any fractional share interests, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of PFS. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
PFS shall, following the Effective Time, pay to each former holder of SBBX
Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of
PFS Common Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without
interest, determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share (rounded to
the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of PFS Common Stock
that such holder would otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1.3 and (ii) the PFS Closing Price (the "Fractional
Share Consideration"). For purposes of determining any fractional share
interest, all shares of SBBX Common Stock owned by a SBBX shareholder shall be
combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of PFS Common
Stock issuable to such SBBX shareholder.

3.1.5. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of PFS Common
Stock or SBBX Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number or
kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a
recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, reverse stock
split or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio
to give holders of SBBX Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

3.2. _________Procedures for Exchange of SBBX Common Stock._

 

3.2.1. _Exchange of Certificates_. Prior to the Effective Time, PFS shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to SBBX to act as the
exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). As
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than
five (5) business days thereafter, PFS shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares
of SBBX Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1 (i) a letter of transmittal which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration
that such holder shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with,
and subject to, Section 3.1.3, and any cash in lieu payable in respect of
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1.4, and any
dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 3.2.3. From and
after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of the Old Certificates (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal
duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing the
Merger Consideration to which such holder of SBBX Common Stock shall
have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, Section
3.1.3,

 



10

    

 and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
surrendered Old Certificate pursuant to Section 3.1.4 and (B) any dividends
or distributions that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
surrendered Old Certificate pursuant to Section 3.2.3, and the Old Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrue on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old
Certificates or any dividends payable under Section 3.2.3. Until each Old
Certificate is surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2.1, such Old
Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration (together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of
fractional shares issued in consideration therefor, without interest), subject
to all applicable withholding of Tax in accordance with Section 3.2.7. The
Exchange Agent shall accept such Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. If any New Certificate representing shares of
PFS Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New
Certificate representing shares of PFS Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or required
for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

3.2.2. _Exchange Fund._ At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, PFS
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in accordance with
this Section 3.2 (a) New Certificates representing the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 3.1.3 and exchanged pursuant to
Section 3.2.1 and (b) cash in an amount sufficient to pay any cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of PFS Common Stock (such cash and New Certificates
described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "); _provided_ that no such investment income or losses
thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders
of Old Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be solely for the benefit of and paid to PFS.

 

3.2.3. _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The holder of
an Old Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and
outstanding SBBX Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time,
with respect to such SBBX Common Stock except to surrender the Old Certificate
in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement.
No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to PFS Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate
in accordance with this Section 3.2. After the surrender of an Old
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.2, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of PFS Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate.

3.2.4. _Closing of Transfer Books_. After the Effective Time, there shall be
no transfers on the stock transfer books of SBBX of the SBBX Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or distributions payable
with respect thereto in accordance with Section 3.2.3 and cash in lieu of
fractional shares issued in consideration therefor in accordance with Section
3.1.4), subject to all applicable withholding of Tax in accordance 3.2.7, that
the holder presenting such Old Certificates is entitled to, as provided in
this Section 3.2 as provided in this Section 3.2.

3.2.5. _Return of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the shareholders of SBBX for one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered or paid to PFS. Any former

 



11

    

 shareholders of SBBX who have not theretofore complied with this Article III
shall thereafter look only to PFS for payment of the Merger Consideration
(together with any dividends or distributions payable with respect thereto in
accordance with Section 3.2.3 and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in
consideration therefor in accordance with Section 3.1.4) in respect of each
former share of SBBX Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of PFS, SBBX, the Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder
of shares of SBBX Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

 

3.2.6. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Old
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent or PFS, the posting
by such person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent or PFS
may reasonably require, the Exchange Agent or PFS, as applicable, will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the Merger
Consideration (together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration
therefor) in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

3.2.7. _Withholding._  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, PFS
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to
deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of PFS Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Article III or any other amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of SBBX Common Stock such amounts as
PFS (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the
extent that such amounts are properly withheld by PFS or the Exchange Agent,
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the SBBX Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and
withholding were made by PFS or the Exchange Agent.

3.2.8. _Reservation of Shares_ _._ PFS shall reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of PFS Common Stock for the purpose of issuing
shares of PFS Common Stock to the SBBX shareholders in accordance with this
Article III.

 

3.3. _SBBX Equity Awards._

 

3.3.1. _Treatment of SBBX Stock Options._ At the Effective Time, each SBBX
Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised
shall be canceled and converted, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, into the right to receive an amount of cash equal
to the product of (i) the excess of (A) the Per Share Stock Consideration,
over (B) the exercise price of such SBBX Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares of SBBX Common Stock subject to said SBBX Stock Option
(whether vested or unvested). Any SBBX Stock Option with an exercise
price that equals or exceeds the Per Share Stock Consideration shall be
canceled with no consideration being paid to the option holder with respect to
such SBBX Stock Option. PFS, SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary, as directed by PFS,
shall pay the consideration described in this Section 3.3.1, less required
withholding taxes, within five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date.

 

3.3.2. _Treatment of SBBX Restricted Stock._ Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each share of SBBX Restricted Stock that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest (with any
performance-based vesting condition to be determined based upon either: (i)
the actual performance of the performance goals as of a date reasonably
proximal to the Effective Time based upon pro-rated performance metrics
through such date; or (ii) if actual performance is not determinable,
achievement at target level) and shall be cancelled and converted at
the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, into the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share of SBBX Restricted Stock

 



12

    

 in accordance with Section 3.1.3, (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares that
the shares of SBBX Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.1.3 and Section 3.1.4, and (C) any accrued but unpaid
dividends or distributions on such shares of SBBX Restricted Stock. The
Surviving Corporation shall issue the consideration described in this Section
3.3.2, less applicable tax withholdings, within five (5) business days
following the Closing Date.

3.3.3. _Certain Actions of SBBX._ At or prior to the Effective Time, SBBX,
the Board of Directors of SBBX and/or its compensation committee, as
applicable, shall adopt resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.3.

statements contained in this Article IV are correct and complete as of the

(as though made then and as though the Closing Date were substituted for the
date of this Agreement throughout this Article IV), except as set forth in
the SBBX Disclosure Schedules delivered by SBBX to PFS on the date hereof, and
except as to any representation or warranty which relates to a specific date.
SBBX has made a good faith effort to ensure that the disclosure on
each schedule of the SBBX Disclosure Schedules corresponds to the section
referenced herein. However, for purposes of the SBBX Disclosure Schedules, (i)
no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation
or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or
warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of an item
in the SBBX Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by SBBX that such item represents a
material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on SBBX and (iii) any
disclosures made in the SBBX Disclosure Schedule with respect to a section of
this Article IV shall be deemed to qualify any other section of this Article
IV (A) specifically referenced or cross-referenced in such disclosure or (B)
to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross-reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure applies to such other sections of this Article.

 

4.2. _________Organization._

 

4.2.1. SBBX is a New Jersey corporation duly organized and validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey, and is duly
registered with the FRB as a bank holding company under the BHCA. SBBX has the
corporate power to own its properties and assets, to incur its liabilities and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. SBBX is duly licensed
or qualified to do business in the states of the United States and foreign
jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on SBBX.

4.2.2. SB One Bank is a bank duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey. SB One Bank has the full
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on SBBX. The deposits of SB One Bank are insured by the FDIC to the
fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums and assessments required to
be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due. SB One Bank is a
member in good standing of the FHLB and owns the requisite amount of stock
therein.

 



13

    

4.2.3. SBBX Disclosure Schedule 4.2.3 lists every SBBX Subsidiary, and
for each SBBX Subsidiary, its jurisdiction of incorporation, SBBXs
percentage ownership and the name and number of shares held by any other
person who owns any stock. SBBX owns all the capital stock of the SBBX
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any lien or encumbrance. Each SBBX Subsidiary
(other than SB One Bank) is a corporation, limited liability company or other

laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and each has all
requisite company, partnership or corporate (as applicable) power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on SBBX. Other than shares of capital stock of the SBBX Subsidiaries

(other than with respect to health or disability insurance). All such
insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect, and within

transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. There is no injunction, order,
award, judgment, settlement, decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon or

and that meets the requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT
Act and the regulations thereunder.

4.11.2. Neither SBBX nor any SBBX Subsidiary has any Knowledge of, nor
has SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary been advised of, or has any reason to believe
that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause SBBX or any SBBX
Subsidiary: (a) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the
CRA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating
for CRA purposes by Bank Regulators of lower than "Satisfactory"; (b) to be

regulations promulgated thereunder, any order issued with respect to anti-
money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign
Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule
or regulation; or (c) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with
the applicable requirements contained in any federal and state privacy or data
security laws and regulations. Neither SBBX nor any SBBX Subsidiary is a
party to any agreement with any individual or group regarding CRA matters.

the security or confidentiality of Personal Data (clauses (i) through (iii), a

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SBBX.

authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all
filings, applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and
Bank Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted except where the
failure to hold such permits, licensees, authorizations, orders or approvals,
or the failure to make such filings, applications or registrations would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on SBBX or SB One Bank; all such permits, licenses,
certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect
in all material respects and, to the Knowledge of SBBX, no suspension or
cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is

5.1. _________General._

 

PFS represents and warrants to SBBX that the statements contained in this
Article V are correct and complete as of the date of this Agreement and will
be correct and complete as of the Closing Date (as though made then and as
though the Closing Date were substituted for the date of this Agreement
throughout this Article V), except as set forth in the PFS Disclosure
Schedules delivered by PFS to SBBX on the date hereof, and except as to any
representation or warranty which relates to a specific date. PFS has made a
good faith effort to ensure that the disclosure on each schedule of the PFS
Disclosure Schedules corresponds to the section referenced herein. However,
for purposes of the PFS Disclosure Schedules (i) no such item is required to
be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence
would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed
untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the PFS Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission by PFS that such item 

 



28

    

 represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such
item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on PFS and
(iii) any disclosures made in the PFS Disclosure Schedule with respect to a
section of this Article V shall be deemed to qualify any other section of this
Article V (A) specifically referenced or cross-referenced in such disclosure
or (B) to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding
the absence of a specific cross-reference) from a reading of the disclosure
that such disclosure applies to such other sections of this Article.

to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. PFS is duly licensed
or qualified to do business in the states of the United States and foreign

standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or
leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on PFS. The deposits of Provident Bank are insured by

assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due. Provident Bank is a member in good standing of the FHLB and owns the

and direct control of PFS and the PFS Subsidiaries or their accountants
(including all means of access thereto and there from), except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls described below in this Section 5.6.4. PFS (i) has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal

and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by

PFSs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B)

As of their respective dates, the PFS Securities Documents complied as to form
with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as
applicable, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder in all material respects. As of their respective dates and as of
the date any information has been incorporated by reference therein, the

fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC
with respect to any of the PFS Securities Documents.

correct, and complete in all material respects. All material Taxes of PFS and
each PFS Subsidiary (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due
have been fully and timely paid. Each of PFS and each PFS Subsidiary has
withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid
in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor,
stockholder, independent contractor or other third party. Neither PFS nor any

Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the assets of PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary. PFS has made available to PFS true and complete copies of any
private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition
agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6)

member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return

Code) in a distribution of stock intending to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code. Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has
participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). At no time during the past five (5) years
has PFS been a United States real property holding corporation within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

5.8. _Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage._

5.8.1. PFS and each PFS Subsidiary has good and, as to real property,
marketable title to all material assets and properties owned by PFS or each
PFS Subsidiary in the conduct of their businesses, whether such assets and
properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and
property reflected in the balance sheets contained in the PFS Regulatory
Reports and in the PFS Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto
(except to the extent that such assets and properties have been disposed of in
the ordinary course of business, since the date of such balance sheets),
subject to no material encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or
pledges, except (i) those items which secure liabilities for public or
statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or other
obligations to FHLB and FRB, inter-bank credit facilities, or any transaction
by a PFS Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, (ii) statutory liens for
amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith, (iii)

the right under valid and existing leases of real and personal properties used
by PFS and its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or
use all such properties as presently occupied and used by each of them.

5.8.2. PFS and each PFS Subsidiary are insured with reputable insurers against
such risks and in such amounts that management of PFS reasonably determined
to be prudent, sufficient and consistent with industry practice, and PFS and
each PFS Subsidiary are in compliance in all material respects with their
insurance policies. Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has received notice
from any insurance carrier during the past five years that (i) such insurance
will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or
(ii) premium costs (other than with respect to health or disability
insurance) with respect to such policies of insurance will be materially
increased. There are presently no material claims pending under such policies
of insurance and no notices have been given by PFS or any PFS Subsidiary under
such policies (other than with respect to health or disability insurance).
All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect.

 

5.9. _Legal Proceedings._

 

Except as set forth in PFS Disclosure Schedule 5.9, there is no suit, action,
investigation or proceeding pending or, to PFS Knowledge, threatened against
or adversely affecting PFS or any PFS Subsidiary (and to PFSs Knowledge there
are no facts or circumstances that reasonably could be expected to be the
basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) (1) that involves a
Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator, or (2) that, individually or in the
aggregate, if determined adversely to PFS or any such PFS Subsidiary, would be

 



33

    

 (A) material to its businesses, or (B) reasonably likely to prevent or delay
it from performing its obligations under, or consummating the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement. There is no injunction, order, award,
judgment, settlement, decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon or entered
into by PFS or any PFS Subsidiary (or that, upon consummation of the Merger,
would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates) or to
which their respective assets are subject.

5.10. _Compliance With Applicable Law._

 

5.10.1. To PFSs Knowledge, PFS and each PFS Subsidiary is in compliance in

laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures, that has not been declared
ineffective by any Governmental Entity and that meets the requirements of
Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.

 

5.10.2. Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has any Knowledge of, nor has PFS
or any PFS Subsidiary been advised of, or has any reason to believe that any
facts or circumstances exist, which would cause PFS or any PFS Subsidiary: (a)
to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the CRA, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for
CRA purposes by Bank Regulators of lower than "Satisfactory"; (b) to be
deemed to be operating in violation of the federal Bank Secrecy Act, as
amended, and its implementing regulations, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, any order issued with respect to anti-
money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign
Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or
regulation; or (c) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the
applicable requirements contained in any federal and state privacy or data
security laws and regulations. Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary is a party
to any agreement with any individual or group regarding CRA matters.

5.10.3. PFS (including Provident Bank) maintains a written information privacy
and security program that maintains reasonable measures to protect the
privacy, confidentiality and security of all Personal Data against any
Security Breach. To the knowledge of PFS, neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary
has experienced any Security Breach that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on PFS. To
the knowledge of PFS, there are no data security or other technological
vulnerabilities with respect to its information technology systems or networks
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on PFS.

5.10.4. PFS and each PFS Subsidiary has all material permits, licenses,
authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and Bank
Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted except where the
failure to hold such permits, licensees, authorizations, orders or approvals,
or the failure to make such filings, applications or registrations would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on PFS or Provident Bank; all such permits, licenses,
certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect
in all material respects and, to the Knowledge of PFS, no suspension or
cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is

 



34

    

 threatened or will result from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining Regulatory Approvals.

 

5.10.5. Except as set forth in PFS Disclosure Schedule 5.10.5, neither PFS nor
any PFS Subsidiary is, or since December 31, 2017 has been, subject to any
cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or a party to
any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with,
or a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or subject to
any order or directive by, or ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, any
Bank Regulator. Except as set forth in PFS Disclosure Schedule 5.10.5, since
December 31, 2017, neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has received any written
notification or, to PFSs Knowledge, any other communication from any Bank
Regulator (i) asserting that PFS or any PFS Subsidiary is not in material
compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Bank
Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit
or governmental authorization which is material to PFS or any PFS Subsidiary;
(iii) requiring, or threatening to require, PFS or any PFS Subsidiary, or
indicating that PFS or any PFS Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a
cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any
other agreement with any federal or state governmental agency or authority
which is charged with the supervision or regulation of banks or engages in the
insurance of bank deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict
or limit, in any material respect the operations of PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the payment of
dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to
direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the operations of PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the payment of
dividends (any such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or order
described in this sentence is hereinafter referred to as an "PFS Regulatory
Agreement"). The most recent regulatory rating given to PFS and Provident Bank
as to compliance with the CRA is "Satisfactory" or better.

 

5.10.6. Following the completion of the Merger, Provident Banks regulatory

Exchange Act, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, HIPAA and any regulations or rules
promulgated thereunder, and all material filings, disclosures and notices
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, HIPAA and any other applicable law
have been timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or other impositions
for late filings have been paid in full, if due. Except as disclosed in PFS
Disclosure Schedule 5.11.1, neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has any
commitment to create any additional material PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan
or to materially modify, change or renew any existing PFS Compensation
and Benefit Plan, except as required by applicable law or Governmental
Entity, to maintain the qualified status thereof or in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.

 

5.11.2. Each PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a Pension Plan and
which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is
established pursuant to IRS-approved prototype or volume

 



35

    

 submitter documents or has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS, and to PFSs Knowledge, there are no factors or circumstances which
are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of PFS,
threatened material action, suit or claim relating to any of the PFS
Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for
benefits). Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction,
or omitted to take any action, with respect to any PFS Compensation and
Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary to a material unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975
of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

5.11.3. All material contributions required to be made under the terms of any
PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made or are accrued on
PFSs Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. PFS and its Subsidiaries
have duly expensed and accrued as a liability the present value of future
benefits under each applicable PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan for financial
reporting purposes as required by GAAP.

5.11.4. No liability to any Governmental Entity, other than PBGC premiums
arising in the ordinary course of business and timely made, has been or is
expected by PFS or any of its Subsidiaries to be incurred with respect to any
PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a defined benefit pension plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA ("PFS Defined Benefit Plan"), or with respect to
any "single employer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently
or formerly maintained by PFS or any entity which is considered one employer
with PFS under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an
"ERISA Affiliate"). No PFS Defined Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension
plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. To the Knowledge of
PFS, (a) all required contributions to each PFS Defined Benefit Plan have been
made in compliance with Section 412 and 430 of the Code and Section 302 and
303 of ERISA on or before the applicable due date, and there are no
contributions which are required to be made to any of the Title IV Plan during
the year ending December 31, 2020; (b) no PFS Defined Benefit Plan
has applied for or received a waiver of the minimum funding standards or an
extension of any amortization period within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Sections 302 or 303 of ERISA; (c) there are no funding-based
limitations (within the meaning of Section 436 of the Code) currently in
effect with respect to a PFS Defined Benefit Plan; and (d) all premiums
payable and due pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA with respect to a PFS
Defined Benefit Plan have been timely paid.

5.12. _Environmental Matters._

 

5.12.1. To the Knowledge of PFS, neither the conduct nor operation of its
business nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned or
operated by it (including, without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency
capacity), or on which it holds a lien, results or resulted in a violation of
any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a material
liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon PFS or any of
PFS Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of PFS, no condition has existed or event has
occurred with respect to any such property that, with notice or the passage of
time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in any material liability to
PFS or any PFS Subsidiary by reason of any Environmental Laws. Neither PFS nor
any PFS Subsidiary has during the past five years received any written notice
from any Person or Governmental Entity that PFS or any PFS Subsidiary or the
operation or condition of any property ever owned, operated, or held as
collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by any of them are currently in
violation of or otherwise are alleged to have liability under any
Environmental Laws or relating to Materials of Environmental Concern
(including, but not limited to, responsibility (or potential responsibility)
for the cleanup or other remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern
at, on, beneath, or originating from any such property) for which a material
liability is reasonably likely to be imposed upon PFS or any PFS Subsidiary.

5.12.2. There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to PFSs Knowledge,
threatened, before any court, governmental agency or other forum against PFS
or any PFS Subsidiary (x) for alleged noncompliance (including by any
predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law or (y) relating
to the presence of or release into the environment of any Materials of
Environmental Concern, whether or not occurring at or on a site owned, leased
or operated by PFS or any PFS Subsidiary.

 



36

    

5.13. _Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors._

 

Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
incurred any liability or commitment for any fees or commissions to any such
person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
except for the retention of Piper Sandler and Co. and the fee payable pursuant
thereto.

5.14. _Intellectual Property._

 

PFS and each PFS Subsidiary owns or, to PFSs Knowledge, possesses valid and
binding licenses and other rights (subject to expirations in accordance with
their terms) to use all patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trade names,
service marks and trademarks, which are material to the conduct of their
business as currently conducted, each without payment, except for all
license agreements under which license fees or other payments are due in the
ordinary course of PFSs or each of PFSs Subsidiaries business, except in
each case the absence of which, either individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on PFS and the
PFS Subsidiaries taken as a whole and neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has
received any notice of conflict with respect thereto that asserts the rights
of others. PFS and each PFS Subsidiary has performed all the material
obligations required to be performed, and are not in default in any respect,
under any contract, agreement, arrangement or commitment relating to any of
the foregoing. To the Knowledge of PFS, the conduct of the business of PFS
and each PFS Subsidiary as currently conducted or proposed to be conducted
does not, in any material respect, infringe upon, dilute, misappropriate or
otherwise violate any intellectual property owned or controlled by any third
party, except in each case which, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on PFS and
the PFS Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 

5.15. _Labor Matters._

 

There are no labor or collective bargaining agreements to which PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary is a party. There is no union organizing effort pending or, to the
Knowledge of PFS, threatened against PFS or any PFS Subsidiary. There is no
labor strike, labor dispute (other than routine employee grievances that are
not related to union employees), work slowdown, stoppage or lockout
pending or, to the Knowledge of PFS, threatened against PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary. There is no unfair labor proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge
of PFS, threatened in writing against PFS or any PFS Subsidiary (other than
routine employee grievances that are not related to union employees). PFS and
each PFS Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours, and are not engaged in any
unfair labor practice, except for such noncompliance which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on PFS and the PFS Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 

5.16. _No Material Adverse Effect._

 

Since December 31, 2019, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on PFS and the PFS Subsidiaries taken as
a whole.

5.17. _Risk Management Instruments._

 

All material interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures and
forward contracts and other similar risk management arrangements, whether
entered into for PFSs own account, or for the account of one or more PFS
Subsidiaries or their customers, were in all material respects entered into in
compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory
policies, and to the Knowledge of PFS, with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time; and to PFSs Knowledge each of them
constitutes the valid and

 



37

    

 legally binding obligation of PFS or one of the PFS Subsidiaries,
enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles), and is in full
force and effect. Neither PFS nor Provident Bank is, nor to the Knowledge of
PFS is any other party thereto, in breach of any of its obligations under any
such agreement or arrangement in any material respect.

 

5.18. _Loan Portfolio._

 

5.18.1. The allowance for loan losses reflected in PFSs audited consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2019 was, and the allowance for loan losses
shown on the balance sheets in PFSs Financial Statements for periods ending
after December 31, 2019 will be, adequate under GAAP.

 

5.18.2. PFS has made available to SBBX a listing of loans that as of December
31, 2019 are classified as "Other Loans Specially Mentioned," "Special
Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss," "Classified," "Criticized,"
"Watch list" or words of similar import, together with the principal amount
of and accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the identity of the
obligor thereunder.

5.18.3. All loans receivable (including discounts) and accrued interest
entered on the books of Provident Bank arose out of bona fide arms-length
transactions and were made for good and valuable consideration in the ordinary
course of Provident Banks business. All such loans are owned by Provident
Bank free and clear of any liens.

5.18.4. The notes and other evidences of indebtedness evidencing the loans
described above, and all pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust and other
collateral documents or security instruments relating thereto are, in all
material respects, valid, true and genuine, and what they purport to be.

5.18.5. Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary is now, or has been since December
31, 2016, subject to any fine, suspension, settlement or other contract or
other administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction in any loan
purchase commitment from, any Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator relating
to the origination, sale or servicing of mortgage or consumer loans.

5.18.6. PFS and the PFS Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all
securities owned by them, free and clear of any liens, except to the extent
such securities are pledged in the ordinary course of business to secure
obligations of PFS or a PFS Subsidiary. Such securities are valued on the
books of PFS in accordance with GAAP in all material respects. PFS employs
investment, securities, risk management and other policies, practices and
procedures which PFS believes are prudent and reasonable.

 

5.19. _PFS Information Supplied_

 

The information relating to PFS, any PFS Subsidiary and its and their
respective directors and officers to be contained in the Proxy
Statement, Merger Registration Statement, or in any other document filed with
any Bank Regulator or other Governmental Entity in connection herewith, will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The Merger Registration
Statement will comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder and the provisions of the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is
made by PFS with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by SBBX specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Merger Registration Statement.

making any express or implied representation or warranty other than those

6.2. _Current Information._

 

6.2.1. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, SBBX will cause one or more of its representatives to confer with
representatives of PFS and report the general status of its ongoing operations
at such times as PFS may reasonably request. SBBX will promptly notify PFS of
any material change in the normal course of its business or in the operation
of its properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the initiation or the threat
of material litigation involving SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary. Without

meet with senior officers of PFS on a monthly basis to review the financial
and operational affairs of SBBX.

 

6.2.2. SBBX and PFS shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the
conversion of SBBXs data processing and related electronic informational
systems to those used by PFS, which planning shall include, but not be limited
to, discussion of the possible termination by SBBX of third-party service
provider

 



42

    

 arrangements effective at the Effective Time or at a date thereafter, non-
renewal of personal property leases and software licenses used by SBBX
in connection with its systems operations, retention of outside consultants
and additional employees to assist with the conversion, and outsourcing, as

place prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.2.3. SBBX shall provide PFS, within 15 business days of the end of each
calendar month, a written list of all SB One Bank delinquent loans and

6.2.4. SBBX shall promptly inform PFS upon receiving notice of any legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices, audits or
investigations (by any federal, state or local commission, agency or board)

labor or employment law.

 

6.3. _Access to Properties and Records._

 

6.3.1. Subject to Section 12.1 hereof, SBBX shall permit PFS reasonable access
during normal business hours upon reasonable notice to its properties, and
shall disclose and make available to PFS during normal business hours all of
its books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties, operations,
obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books
of account (including the general ledger), tax records, minute books of
directors (other than minutes that discuss any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter SBBX reasonably
determines should be treated as confidential) and shareholders meetings,
organizational documents, Bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings
with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees,
and any other business activities or prospects in which Provident Bank may
have a reasonable interest; _provided_ , _however_ , that SBBX shall not be
required to take any action that would provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or other person or
would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications
between it and any of its counsel or as not permitted by law or regulation.
SBBX shall provide and shall request its auditors to provide PFS with such
historical financial information regarding it (and related audit reports and
consents) as PFS may reasonably request for securities disclosure purposes.
PFS and Provident Bank shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
any interference with SBBXs regular business operations during any such
access to SBBXs property, books and records.

 

6.3.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3,
in no event shall PFS have access to any information that, based on advice of
SBBXs counsel, would (a) reasonably be expected to waive any material legal
privilege (b) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties
or (c) violate any obligation of SBBX with respect to confidentiality so long
as, with respect to confidentiality, to the extent specifically requested by
PFS, SBBX has made commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver
regarding the possible disclosure from the third party to whom it owes
an obligation of confidentiality. All requests made pursuant to this Section
6.3 shall be directed to an executive officer of SBBX or such Person or
Persons as may be designated by SBBX. All information received pursuant to
this Section 6.3 shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

6.4. _Financial and Other Statements._

 

6.4.1. Promptly upon receipt thereof, SBBX will furnish to PFS copies of each
annual, interim or special audit of the books of SBBX and each SBBX
Subsidiary made by its independent auditors and copies of all internal control
reports submitted to SBBX by such auditors in connection with each annual,
interim or special audit of the books of SBBX and the SBBX Subsidiaries made
by such auditors.

 



43

    

6.4.2. As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date
such documents are filed with the Bank Regulators, SBBX will deliver to PFS
the SBBX Regulatory Reports. SBBX will furnish to PFS copies of all documents,
statements and reports as it shall send to its shareholders, the FDIC, the FRB
or any other regulatory authority, except as legally prohibited thereby.
Within 15 days after the end of each month, SBBX will deliver to PFS a monthly
financial package that shall include a consolidated balance sheet and a
consolidated statement of income, without related notes, for such month
prepared in accordance with current financial reporting practices.

6.4.3. SBBX will advise PFS promptly of the receipt of any examination report
of any Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of SBBX or
any SBBX Subsidiary.

 

6.4.4. With reasonable promptness, SBBX will furnish to PFS such additional
financial data that SBBX possesses and as PFS may reasonably request,
including without limitation, detailed monthly financial statements and loan
reports.

6.5. _Maintenance of Insurance._

 

SBBX shall maintain, and shall cause the SBBX Subsidiaries to maintain,
insurance in such amounts as are reasonable to cover such risks as
are customary in relation to the character and location of their properties
and the nature of their business and consistent with past practice.

 

6.6. _Disclosure Supplements._

 

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, SBBX will promptly supplement
or amend the SBBX Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such SBBX Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary to correct
any information in such SBBX Disclosure Schedules which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to
give notice in accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to
constitute a violation of this Section 6.6 or the failure of any condition set
forth in Article IX to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by SBBX, unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure to satisfy of the conditions set forth in Article IX. No
supplement or amendment to such SBBX Disclosure Schedules shall have any
effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Article IX.

 

6.7. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

 

SBBX shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each SBBX
Subsidiary to use its best efforts, to obtain as soon as practicable
all consents and approvals necessary or desirable for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.8.  __ _Reasonable_ _Best Efforts._

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, SBBX agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.9. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

 

In the event that SBBX determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive
that condition, it will promptly notify PFS.

 



44

    

6.10. _No Solicitation._

 

(a) SBBX shall not, and shall cause the SBBX Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents
(collectively, the "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action
to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person
(other than PFS) any information or data with respect to SBBX or any of the
SBBX Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood that issuing any press release or furnishing any documents filed
or furnished by SBBX pursuant to the requirements of Exchange Act would not
constitute a violation of this Section); (iii) without the prior written
consent of PFS, release any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to
enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which SBBX is
a party; or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to
approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or
letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by SBBX or any Representative, whether or not such
Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Representative is
purporting to act on behalf of SBBX or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by SBBX. SBBX and the SBBX Subsidiaries shall, and
cause each of the SBBX Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications
with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition
Proposal.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from PFS),
whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any transaction or
series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving SBBX
or any of the SBBX Subsidiaries; (B) any transaction pursuant to which any
third party or group acquires or would acquire (whether through sale, lease or
other disposition), directly or indirectly, any assets of SBBX or any of the
SBBX Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, 25% or more of the assets
of SBBX and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (C) any issuance, sale
or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share
exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or
warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such securities)
representing 25% or more of the votes attached to the outstanding securities
of SBBX or any of the SBBX Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any third party or group
beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity securities of SBBX or
any of the SBBX Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction which is similar in form,
substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any combination
of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.10(a), SBBX may take any of the
actions described in clause (ii) and (iv) of Section 6.10(a) if, but only if
prior to the SBBX Shareholders Meeting, (i) SBBX has received a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, that did not result from a breach of
this Section 6.10; (ii) the SBBX Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside legal
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its independent financial
advisor, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) it is required to take such
actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to SBBXs shareholders under
applicable law; (iii) SBBX has provided PFS with at least three Business
Days prior notice of such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or
affording access to any information or data with respect to SBBX or otherwise
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, SBBX receives from such Person a
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to SBBX than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. SBBX shall promptly provide to PFS
any non-public information regarding SBBX or its Subsidiaries provided to any
other Person that was not previously provided to PFS, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other party.

 



45

    

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction on
terms that the SBBX Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor (i) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition
of all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of SBBX
Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of SBBX and the SBBX
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a transaction that
(A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares of SBBX Common Stock
that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the
consideration to be paid to SBBXs shareholders pursuant to this Agreement,
considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration being offered
and any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated with the
timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in addition to those specifically
contemplated hereby, and (B) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal,
more favorable to SBBXs shareholders than the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely to be completed
on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal.

 

(c) SBBX shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify PFS in
writing if any proposals or offers (or modified offers or proposals) are
received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or
discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with SBBX or any SBBX
Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and
such notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions
or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of
written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussion, providing copies of such materials (including
e-mails or other electronic communications) except to the extent that such
materials constitute confidential information of the party making such offer
or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement). SBBX agrees that it
shall keep PFS informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussions (including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer
or request).

 

(d) Subject to Section 6.10(e), neither the SBBX Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or propose to withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to PFS in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), the SBBX
Recommendation (as defined in Section 8.1), fail to reaffirm the
SBBX Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following a written request
by PFS, or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the SBBX
Shareholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the SBBX
Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause SBBX or any
of the SBBX Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any
Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into
in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.10(b)) or (B) requiring SBBX to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding Section 6.10(d), prior to the date of the SBBX
Shareholders Meeting, the SBBX Board may withdraw, qualify, amend or modify
the SBBX Recommendation (a "SBBX Subsequent Determination") after the third
Business Day following PFSs receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal") from SBBX advising PFS that the SBBX Board intends to determine
that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received
(that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.10) constitutes a
Superior Proposal if, but only if (i) the SBBX Board has reasonably determined
in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of
outside legal counsel and an independent financial advisor, that it
is required to take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to
SBBXs shareholders under applicable law, (ii) during the three (3) Business
Day period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by PFS (the
"Notice Period"), SBBX and the SBBX Board shall have cooperated and
negotiated in good faith with PFS to make such adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable SBBX
to proceed with the SBBX Recommendation without a SBBX Subsequent
Determination; _provided_ , _however_ ,

 



46

    

 that PFS shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
(iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into account any such
adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been proposed by PFS since its
receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the SBBX Board has again in good
faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 6.10(e) and
(B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the
event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, SBBX shall be
required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to PFS and again comply
with the requirements of this Section 6.10(e), except that the Notice Period
shall be reduced to one (1) Business Day.

 

(f) Notwithstanding any SBBX Subsequent Determination, this Agreement shall be
submitted to SBBXs shareholders at the SBBX Shareholders Meeting for the
purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve SBBX of such obligation; _ provided_, _ however_, that
if the SBBX Board shall have made a SBBX Subsequent Determination, then the
SBBX Board may submit this Agreement to the SBBXs shareholders without
recommendation, in which event the SBBX Board may communicate the basis for
its lack of a recommendation to the SBBXs shareholders in the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto. In
addition to the foregoing, for so long as this Agreement remains in effect,
SBBX shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal
other than this Agreement and the Merger.

 

(g) SBBX shall adjourn or postpone the SBBX Shareholders Meeting if, (i) as of
the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of SBBX Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the SBBX
Shareholders Meeting or (ii) on the date of the SBBX Shareholders Meeting,
SBBX has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
necessary to obtain the requisite vote of the shareholders of SBBX; _
provided_ that, from and after such time, if any, that (in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that has been received by SBBX and that has been
publicly disclosed or otherwise become public) SBBX makes a SBBX Subsequent
Determination that is permitted by Section 6.10(e), SBBX thereafter shall not
be so required to adjourn or postpone the SBBX Shareholders Meeting more than
two (2) times following such time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, the SBBX Shareholders Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement
shall be submitted to the shareholders of SBBX at the SBBX Shareholders
Meeting for the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the
other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve SBBX of such obligation, including if SBBX makes a SBBX
Subsequent Determination.

6.11. _Board of Directors and Committee Meetings._

(a) SBBX shall distribute a copy of each SBBX Board package, including the
agenda and any draft minutes, to PFS promptly after it distributes a copy of
such packages to the SBBX Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that SBBX shall not
be required to copy PFS on any documents that disclose confidential
discussions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any
third party proposal to acquire control of SBBX or any other matter that the
SBBX Board has been advised of by counsel that such distribution to PFS may
violate a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any law
or regulation.

(b) Following the receipt of all Regulatory Approvals (without regard to any
waiting periods associated therewith), SBBX shall upon the reasonable request
and notice of PFS permit, and shall cause the SBBX Subsidiaries to permit, a
representative of PFS to attend any meeting of their Board of Directors,
executive committee, loan (or credit) committee and asset liability committee
as observers, _provided_ _that_ SBBX shall not be required to permit such
representative to remain present during any confidential discussion of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any
Acquisition Proposal or during any other matter that the SBBX Board of
Directors has been advised of by counsel that such attendance by these
representatives may violate or be inconsistent with a confidentiality
obligation or fiduciary duty or any legal or regulatory requirement.

 



47

    

6.12. _Shareholder Litigation._

 

SBBX shall give PFS the opportunity to participate at its own expense in the
defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against SBBX and/or its
directors or other affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without PFSs prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

6.13. _Employee_ _Benefits._

 

If requested by PFS in writing no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time and after the SBBX Shareholders Meeting, SBBX shall take
any and all actions, to the extent permitted by law and the terms of the
applicable plan, agreement or arrangement, reasonably necessary (including
without limitation, the adoption of resolutions by its Board of Directors) to
amend, freeze and/or terminate each SBBX Compensation and Benefit Plan
identified in writing by PFS (if permitted by the terms of such SBBX
Compensation Benefit Plan), as of (a) immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(b) such later date as requested by PFS, or (c) if insufficient notice is
provided by PFS in order for SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary to contractually
terminate a SBBX Compensation and Benefit Plan as of such dates, on such later
date as required by the termination provisions of such SBBX Compensation and
Benefit Plan.

ARTICLE VII

 

COVENANTS OF PFS

7.1.  _Conduct of Business._

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
except with the written consent of SBBX, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, PFS will, and it will cause each PFS
Subsidiary to, use reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business
organization and assets and maintain its rights and franchises,
and voluntarily take no action that would or would be reasonably likely to:
(i) prevent or adversely affect or delay the ability of the parties to obtain
the Regulatory Approvals or other approvals of Governmental Entities required
for the transaction contemplated hereby; or (ii) prevent or adversely affect
its ability to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement;
(iii) result in the representations and warranties contained in Article V of
this Agreement not being true and correct on the date of this Agreement or at
any future date on or prior to the Closing Date or in any of the conditions
set forth in Article IX hereof not being satisfied; (iv) take any action or
knowingly fail to take any action where such action or failure to act could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; or (v)
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

7.2. _Regulatory Filings Relating to Merger._

 

In furtherance and not in limitation of Sections 8.2 and 8.3 hereof, PFS will
furnish to SBBX copies of all documents, statements and reports that it or
Provident Bank files with any other Bank Regulator or the SEC with respect to
the Merger and provide SBBX with a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon
prior to submitting such materials to the Bank Regulator or the SEC.

 

7.3. _Maintenance of Insurance._

 

PFS shall maintain, and cause each PFS Subsidiary to maintain, insurance in
such amounts as are reasonable to cover such risks as are customary in
relation to the character and location of their properties and the nature of
their business.

 



48

    

7.4. _________Disclosure Supplements._

 

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, PFS will promptly supplement or
amend the PFS Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any material matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring
or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set
forth or described in such PFS Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to
correct any information in such PFS Disclosure Schedule which has been
rendered inaccurate thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute
a violation of this Section 7.4 or the failure of any condition set forth in
Article IX to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement
by PFS, unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure
to satisfy of the conditions set forth in Article IX. No supplement or
amendment to such PFS Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

 

7.5. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

 

PFS shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as soon as practicable all
consents and approvals, necessary or desirable for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated, and in the manner contemplated, by this Agreement.

7.6. ___Reasonable_ _Best Efforts._

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, PFS agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

7.7. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

 

In the event that PFS determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive
that condition, it will promptly notify SBBX.

7.8. _Employee Benefits._

 

7.8.1. PFS will review all SBBX Compensation and Benefit Plans to determine,
in its sole and absolute discretion, whether to maintain, terminate or
continue such plans. In the event employee compensation and/or benefits as
currently provided by SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary are changed or terminated by
PFS, in whole or in part, PFS shall provide Continuing Employees (as
defined below) with compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate,
substantially similar to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of PFS or applicable PFS Subsidiary (as of the date any
such compensation or benefit is provided). Employees of SBBX or any SBBX
Subsidiary who become participants in a PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan
shall, for purposes of (i) determining eligibility for, (ii) any applicable
vesting periods of and (iii) with respect to vacation and severance rights,
level of benefits of such employee benefits be given credit for meeting such
eligibility, vesting and level of benefits requirements in such plans for
service as an employee of SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary (and
their predecessors) prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that the
foregoing service recognition shall not apply (i) to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services; (ii) for
benefit accrual purposes under any PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan (other
than such plans providing vacation and severance rights); or (iii) where such
service is with respect to a newly-established benefit plan of PFS for which
similarly-situated employees of PFS do not receive past service credit. This
Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of PFS or Provident Bank
to terminate the employment of any employee or to review employee benefits
programs from time to time and to make such changes (including terminating
any program) as they deem appropriate.

 



49

    

7.8.2. PFS and Provident Bank will offer employees of SBBX or any SBBX
Subsidiary whose jobs are eliminated as a result of or in connection with the
Merger priority in applying for open positions within PFS and Provident Bank.
PFS agrees that each employee of SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary who (i) is not
offered employment with PFS or Provident Bank as of the Effective Time or
(ii) is involuntarily terminated by PFS or Provident Bank (other than for
cause as determined in accordance with the personnel policies of Provident
Bank) within twelve months of the Effective Time and who is not covered by a
separate employment agreement, change in control agreement, severance,
consulting, or similar agreement shall receive a severance payment equal to
(A) two weeks of base pay (at the rate in effect on the termination date) for
each full year of service at SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary, with a maximum of 26
weeks and a minimum of four weeks of base pay, plus (B) amounts payable to
such employee for accrued vacation and personal days; _provided_ , _that_
 such individual executes and does not revoke a release agreement in the form
set forth in PFS Disclosure Schedule 7.8.2.

7.8.3. In the event of any termination or consolidation of any SBBX health
plan with any Provident Bank health plan, Provident Bank shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available to employees of SBBX and any
SBBX Subsidiary who continue employment with PFS or Provident Bank
("Continuing Employees") and their dependents employer-provided health
coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to similarly situated
Provident Bank employees. Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively
terminates coverage under a SBBX health plan prior to the time that such
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in a Provident Bank health
plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their
dependents shall terminate under any of the SBBX health plans prior to the
time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all similarly
situated employees of Provident Bank and their dependents. In the event of a
termination or consolidation of any SBBX health plan, terminated SBBX
employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of Provident Bank in accordance with COBRA,
consistent with the provisions below. Provident Bank shall use commercially
reasonable efforts so that employees of SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary who cease
participating in a SBBX health plan and become participants in a comparable
Provident Bank health plan receive credit for any co-payment and deductibles
paid under SBBX health plan for purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Provident Bank health plan,
upon substantiation, in a form satisfactory to Provident Bank that such co-
payment and/or deductible has been satisfied.

7.8.4. PFS shall honor all obligations under the existing employment and
change in control agreements as set forth in SBBX Disclosure Schedule 7.8.4.
Except as otherwise terminated pursuant to Section 6.13, PFS shall assume and
honor all SBBX Compensation and Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms.

 

7.8.5. Anthony J. Labozzetta, President and Chief Executive Officer of SBBX,
shall be appointed as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, PFS and Mr.
Labozzetta shall enter into an employment agreement in the form set forth in
PFS Disclosure Schedule 7.8.5.

 

7.8.6. If requested by PFS, SBBX shall take all such actions as PFS may
request in order to fully and timely comply with any and all requirements of
both the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 and
any state specific WARN Act statutes (collectively, the "WARN Act"), including
providing notices to employees of SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary.

7.9. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

 

7.9.1. PFS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now,
or who has been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the
Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of SBBX or an SBBX Subsidiary
(the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written
consent of PFS, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in
connection

 



50

    

 with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, or administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party
is, or is threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of SBBX or an SBBX Subsidiary if such Claim
pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is
asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent as would have been permitted by SBBX under the NJBCA and under SBBXs
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. PFS shall pay expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent as would have been permitted by SBBX under the
NJBCA, and under SBBXs Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, upon receipt
of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if such officer, director or
employee shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to
indemnification. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 7.9.1 upon learning of any Claim, shall notify PFS (but the
failure so to notify PFS shall not relieve it from any liability which it may
have under this Section 7.9.1, except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices PFS) and shall deliver to PFS the undertaking referred to in the
previous sentence.

 

7.9.2. In the event that either PFS or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of PFS shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.9.

7.9.3. Either Provident Bank or PFS shall maintain, in effect for six years
following the Effective Time, the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies covering the officers and directors of SBBX ( _provided_ ,
_that_ PFS or Provident Bank may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less
favorable) with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall PFS or Provident Bank
be required to expend in the aggregate pursuant to this Section 7.9.3 more
than 200% of the annual cost currently expended by SBBX with respect to such
insurance (the "Maximum Amount");  _provided_ , _further_ _,_ that if the
amount of the annual premium necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, PFS or Provident Bank shall maintain the
most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable
for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In connection with the foregoing,
SBBX agrees in order for PFS or Provident Bank to fulfill its agreement to

7.11. _Current Information._

 

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, PFS
will promptly notify SBBX, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), which might adversely affect
the ability of the parties to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or materially
increase the period of time necessary to obtain such

 



51

    

 approvals; or the institution of material litigation involving PFS and any
PFS Subsidiary. PFS shall be reasonably responsive to requests by SBBX for
access to such information and personnel regarding PFS and Provident Bank as
may be reasonably necessary for SBBX to confirm that the representations and
warranties of PFS and Provident Bank contained herein are true and correct and
that the covenants of PFS and Provident Bank contained herein have been
performed in all material respects; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither PFS
nor Provident Bank shall be required to take any action that would provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure, in
PFSs or Provident Banks reasonable judgment, would interfere with the normal
conduct of PFSs or Provident Banks business or would violate or prejudice
the rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or other
person or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting
communications between it and any of its counsel.

7.12.  _Stock Reserve._

PFS agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the aggregate
Merger Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of
shares of PFS Common Stock to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

Effective as of the Effective Time, PFS shall, (i) increase the size of

Directors of Provident Bank by three members, and (ii) appoint Anthony
Labozzetta, and two other persons from the SBBX board to be selected by PFS
in consultation with SBBX (and who will be subject to PFS customary screening
and evaluation procedures for potential directors and who must meet all
criteria set forth in PFSs governance principles with respect to
qualifications for directors and shall qualify as an independent director
under NYSE rules), to the Board of Directors of PFS and Provident Bank, with
one former SBBX director being appointed to each of the three terms
of directors comprising the PFS and Provident Bank Boards. Additionally, an
advisory board will be appointed by Provident Bank for no less than two years,
and will consist of those SBBX directors who are not selected to serve on the
PFS and Provident Bank Boards, with such other terms as set forth in PFS
Disclosure Schedule 7.13.

or Provident Bank of all or any material portion

 



53

    

 of the business or assets of SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary, (ii) compel PFS or
Provident Bank to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of

SBBX and PFS will furnish each other and each others counsel with all
information concerning themselves, their subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in

those officers and directors of the SBBX subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the "SBBX Insiders"), both
prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that SBBX Insiders not
be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the
conversion of shares of SBBX Common Stock in the Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section

employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly, and in any event
prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause
(in the case of SBBX) any dispositions of SBBX Common Stock by the SBBX
Insiders, and (in the case of PFS) any acquisitions of PFS Common Stock by any
SBBX Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or
directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

8.5. _Dividends._

 

After the date of this Agreement, each of PFS and the SBBX shall coordinate
with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of PFS Common
Stock and SBBX Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating
thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of SBBX
Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend,
in respect of any quarter with respect to their shares of SBBX Common Stock
and any shares of PFS Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange
therefor in the Merger.

8.6.1. Effective as of the Effective Time, PFS shall enter into a supplemental
indenture in accordance with the applicable terms of the indenture related to
the SBBX Subordinated Notes.

8.6.2. Effective as of the Effective Time, subject to Section 8.6.3, PFS
shall enter into a supplemental indenture in accordance with the applicable
terms of the indenture related to the SBBX TPS, providing for assumption by
PFS of the SBBXs obligations thereunder.

 



54

    

8.6.3. In lieu of PFS assuming the SBBX TPS in accordance with Section 8.6.2,
SBBX shall, at the request of PFS, deliver a notice of redemption of the SBBX
TPS and related Junior Subordinated Debentures and irrevocably deposit at or
prior to the Effective Time funds with the applicable trustee sufficient to
pay the applicable redemption price.

8.7. _No Control of Other Party s Business._

 

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give PFS, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of SBBX or any SBBX Subsidiary
prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give SBBX, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of PFS or any PFS Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time. Prior to

thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Index Ratio and the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Purchaser Ratio; _provided_ ,
_however_ , __ that any such increase in the Exchange Ratio pursuant this
Section 11.1.9 shall be paid to the holders of SBBX Common Stock in
cash, determined on a per share basis by multiplying the increase in the
Exchange Ratio by the Average Closing Price. If PFS so elects within such
five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to SBBX of such election
and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred
pursuant to this Section 11.1.9 and this Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been
so modified).

For purposes of this Section 11.1.9 the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

 

"Average Closing Price" means the VWAP of PFS Common Stock as reported on the
NYSE for the five (5) consecutive full trading days ending on the trading day

62

    

12.9. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction._

 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of State of Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law

Directors of SBBX shall be subject to the laws of the State of New Jersey).
Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect of
any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery determines that it lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and, if both
the Court of Chancery and the federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware
determine that they lack subject matter jurisdiction, any state court sitting
in the State of Delaware) (and any courts from which appeals may be taken)
(the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in connection with claims arising under
this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii)

be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 12.4.

 

12.10. _Confidential Supervisory Information._

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no disclosure,

of a Governmental Entity by any party to this Agreement to the extent
prohibited by applicable law. To the extent legally permissible, appropriate
substitute disclosures or actions shall be made or taken under circumstances
in which the limitations of the preceding sentence apply.

12.11. _Interpretation._

 

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The recitals hereto constitute an integral part
of this Agreement. References to Sections include subsections, which are part
of the related Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section 5.5.1" would be part
of "Section 5.5" and references to "Section 5.5" would also refer to material
contained in the subsection described as "Section 5.5.1"). The table of
contents, index and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date
hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires,
shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the Recitals to this
Agreement. The term "made available" means any document or other information
that was (a) included in the virtual data room of a party at least two (2)
business days prior to the date hereof, or (b) filed by a party with the SEC
and publicly available on EDGAR at least two (2) business days prior to the
date hereof. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

12.12. _Specific Performance; Jurisdiction._

 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the provisions contained in this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives
(a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
would be

 



63

    

 adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as
a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

12.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial._

 

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE
LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY

ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
