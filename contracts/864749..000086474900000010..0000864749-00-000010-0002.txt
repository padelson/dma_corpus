the Purchaser shall (i) retain the books and  records of the Companies and
the Subsidiaries relating to periods prior  to the Closing in a manner
reasonably consistent with the prior  practice of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries and (ii) upon reasonable  notice, afford the officers, employees
and authorized agents and  representatives of the Sellers reasonable access
(including the right  to make, at the Sellers\' expense, photocopies), during
normal business  hours, to such books and records.   In order to facilitate
the resolution of any claims made by or against  or incurred by the
Purchaser, the Companies or any Subsidiary after the  Closing or for any
other reasonable purpose, for a period of five years  following the Closing,
the Sellers shall (i) retain the books and  records of the Sellers which
relate to the Companies and the  Subsidiaries and their operations for
periods prior to the Closing and  which shall not otherwise have been
delivered to the Purchaser, the  Companies or any Subsidiary and (ii) upon
reasonable notice, afford the  officers, employees and authorized agents and
representatives of the  Purchaser, the Companies or any Subsidiary reasonable
access (including  the right to make photocopies, at the expense of the
Purchaser, the  Companies or such Subsidiary), during normal business hours,
to such  books and records.   Confidentiality. Following the Closing, the
Sellers agree to, and shall use their best efforts to cause their agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors to: (i) treat
and hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide access to any Person
to) all information relating to trade secrets, processes, patent and
trademark applications, product development, price, customer and supplier
lists, pricing and marketing plans, policies and strategies, details of
client and consultant contracts, operations methods, product development
techniques, business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans and
all other confidential information with respect to the Business, the
Companies and Subsidiaries, (ii) in the event that the Sellers or any such
agent, representative, Affiliate, employee, officer or director becomes
legally compelled to disclose any such information, provide the Purchaser
with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Purchaser, or any
of the Companies or Subsidiaries may seek a protective order or other remedy
or waive compliance with this Section 5.3, (iii) in the event that
such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Purchaser
waives compliance with this Section 5.3, furnish only that portion of such
confidential information which is legally required to be provided and
exercise its best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment
will be accorded such information, (iv) promptly furnish (prior to, at, or as
soon as practicable following, the Closing) to the Companies or the
Purchaser, any and all copies (in whatever form or medium) of all such
confidential information then in the possession of the Sellers or any of its
agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors and,
except as otherwise required by Section 5.2(c), destroy any and all
additional copies then in the possession of the Sellers or any of its agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors of such
information and of any analyses, compilations, studies or other documents
prepared, in whole or in part, on the basis thereof; provided, however, that
this sentence shall not apply to any information that, at the time of
disclosure, is available publicly and was not disclosed in breach of
this Agreement by the Sellers, its agents, representatives, Affiliates,
employees, officers or directors. In addition, with respect to Intellectual
Property, any combination of features shall not be deemed to be within the
foregoing exception merely because the individual features are in the public
domain unless the combination itself and its principle of operation are in
the public domain. Remedies at law for any breach of the obligations of
Sellers under this Section 5.3 are inadequate and the Purchaser shall be
entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific
performance, in the event of any such breach.   Regulatory and Other
Authorizations; Notices and Consents.   The Sellers and the Purchaser shall
use their commercially reasonable  best efforts to obtain (or cause the
Companies and the Subsidiaries to  obtain) all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of all  Governmental Authorities and officials that may
be or become necessary  for its execution and delivery of, and the
performance of its  obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and will
cooperate fully with  the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations,  consents, orders and approvals. Each party hereto agrees to
make an  appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act (and any 
other analogous laws and regulations of other countries) with respect  to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly following  the date
hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable to the  appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and  documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or  such other analogous laws
and regulations.   The Sellers shall or shall cause the Companies and the
Subsidiaries to  give promptly such notices to third parties and use its or
their  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such third party consents
and  estoppel certificates as the Purchaser may in its reasonable
discretion  deem necessary or desirable in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the Sellers  shall
have no obligation to give any guarantee or other consideration  of any
nature in connection with any such notice, consent or estoppel 
certificate   34    or to consent to any change in the terms of any
agreement or  arrangement which the Sellers in their sole and absolute 
discretion may deem adverse to the interests of the Sellers, the  Business or
any of the Companies or Subsidiaries.   The Purchaser shall cooperate and
use all reasonable efforts to assist  the Sellers in giving such notices and
obtaining such consents and  estoppel certificates; provided, however, that
the Purchaser shall have  no obligation to give any guarantee or other
consideration of any  nature in connection with any such notice, consent or
estoppel  certificate or to consent to any change in the terms of any
agreement  or arrangement which the Purchaser in its sole and absolute
discretion  may deem adverse to the interests of the Purchaser, the Business
or any  of the Companies or Subsidiaries.   The Sellers and the Purchaser
agree that, in the event any consent,  approval or authorization necessary or
desirable to preserve for the  Business, the Companies or any Subsidiary any
right or benefit under  any lease, license, contract, commitment or other
agreement or  arrangement to which the Sellers, the Companies or any
Subsidiary is a  party is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Sellers
will,  subsequent to the Closing, cooperate with the Purchaser and the 
Companies in attempting to obtain such consent, approval or  authorization as
promptly thereafter as practicable. If such consent,  approval or
authorization cannot be obtained, the Sellers shall use  their commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the Companies or such  Subsidiary, as the case
may be, with the rights and benefits of the  affected lease, license,
contract, commitment or other agreement or  arrangement for the term of such
lease, license, contract or other  agreement or arrangement, and, if the
Sellers provide such rights and  benefits, the Companies or such Subsidiary,
as the case may be, shall  assume the obligations and burdens thereunder.  
Notice of Developments. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall
promptly notify the Purchaser in writing of all events, circumstances, facts
and occurrences arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement which result
in any breach of a representation or warranty or covenant of the Sellers in
this Agreement which has a Material Adverse Effect or which has the effect of
making any representation or warranty of the Sellers in this Agreement untrue
or incorrect in any material respect.   Environmental Study and Remedial
Action. The Sellers agree that the Purchaser may perform or have performed on
behalf of the Purchaser, at the Purchaser\'s sole expense, prior to Closing a
Phase I environmental audit survey and compliance audit of the Real Property
(the "Environmental Study").   No Solicitation. The Sellers agree that
between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of (i) the Closing and
(ii) the termination of this Agreement, none of the Sellers, the Companies,
the Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
representatives or agents will, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit,
initiate, consider, or encourage or accept any other proposals or offers from
any Person (i) relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any portion
of the capital stock of any of the Companies or Subsidiaries or assets of the
Companies or any Subsidiary (other than Inventory to be sold in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice), (ii) to enter into any
business combination with any of the Companies or Subsidiaries or (iii) to
enter into any other extraordinary business transaction involving or
otherwise relating to any Company or any Subsidiary, or (b) participate in
any discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications
regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or participate in, facilitate or
encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to do any of the
foregoing. The Sellers immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.
The Companies, Subsidiaries or the Sellers shall notify the
Purchaser promptly if any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry or other
contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made and shall, in any such
notice to the Purchaser, indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the
Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact and the terms and
conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact. The Sellers
agree not to, and to cause each of the Companies and Subsidiaries not to,
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, release any Person from,
or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to
which any of the Sellers, the Companies or Subsidiaries is a party.   Use
of Intellectual Property. The Sellers acknowledge that from and after the
Closing, the name "Spectra Precision" and all similar or related names, marks
and logos (all of such names, marks and logos being the "Precision
Names") shall be owned by the Companies or a Subsidiary, that neither the
Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall have any rights in the Precision
Names, and that neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates will contest
the ownership or validity of any rights of the Purchaser, the Companies or
any Subsidiary in or to the Precision Names. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties acknowledge and agree that the Sellers shall have all rights to
the "Spectra Physics" name as well as any and all names, marks and logos
using the name "Spectra" on a standalone basis. Prior to the Closing, Sellers
will replace the term "Spectra Physics" where it appears in the name of any
of the Companies or Subsidiaries with the term "Spectra Precision". From and
after the Closing, neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall use
any of the Owned Intellectual Property or any of the Licensed Intellectual
Property.   Non-Competition.   For three years from the Closing Date
Thermo Electron and its  Restricted Subsidiaries (defined as any entity in
which Thermo Electron  directly or indirectly owns all or a majority of the
beneficial  interest of such entity) will   35    not, with respect to
equipment or related equipment management, data  communications, or data
management systems in each of the  following industries: (i) agricultural,
(ii) construction  equipment, or (iii) land surveying:   Sell or
manufacture for others goods that directly compete with  the lines of
products manufactured or sold by the Business as of the  date of this
Agreement; or   License others with any technology rights whether now or 
hereafter held by Thermo Electron or its Restricted Subsidiaries,  which
would be infringed by any products currently manufactured or sold  by the
Business as of the date of this Agreement.   The provisions of this Section
5.9 shall apply only to Thermo Electron and its Subsidiaries and the parties
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Section 5.9 shall not apply
to any corporation or other business entity that is not a Subsidiary of
Thermo Electron and to which Thermo Electron or any Subsidiary sells,
licenses or otherwise transfer all or any portion of any business, product
line or technology. Any other activities conducted or under demonstrable
development by Thermo Electron and its Subsidiaries (other than the Sellers
and any Subsidiary of any Seller) as of the date of this Agreement,
as evidenced by their records, do not directly compete with the Business
and constitute "Permitted Pursuits." In addition, for the purposes of
this Agreement, Permitted Pursuits shall also mean the Sellers\' (or any of
their Affiliates\') acquisition of another company or business which is
competitive with the Business provided that the total revenue of such
acquired company which is directly competitive with the Business does not
exceed 10% of the acquired company\'s revenues for the most recent fiscal
year.   The Restricted Period shall be extended by the length of any period
during which the Sellers are in breach of the terms of this Section 5.9.  
(c) The Sellers acknowledge that the covenants of the Sellers set forth
in this Section 5.9 are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but
for the agreement of the Sellers to comply with these covenants, the
Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement. The Sellers acknowledge
that this Section 5.9 constitutes an independent covenant and shall not be
affected by performance or nonperformance of any other provision of this
Agreement by the Purchaser, other than Purchaser\'s obligations to pay the
Sellers the Purchase Price and any other sums due hereunder or pursuant to
the Note or any other ancillary agreement. The Sellers have independently
consulted with counsel and after such consultation agree that the covenants
set forth in this Section 5.9 are reasonable and proper and are a reasonable
and proper means of protecting the goodwill and know-how acquired under this
Agreement and the SPAB Asset Purchase Agreement.   Further Action. Each of
the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law, and execute and deliver such
documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 1.1 Audited
Financial Statements. The Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser
audited consolidated financial statements with respect to the Business for
the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 (the "Audited

be prepared in accordance with the books of account and other financial
records of the Companies and the Subsidiaries, (ii) present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of
operations of the Companies and the Subsidiaries as of the date thereof or

consistent with the past practices of the Companies and the Subsidiaries and
(iv) include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals)
that are necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial
condition of the Companies and Subsidiaries and the results of the operations
of the Companies and the Subsidiaries as of the date thereof or for the
period covered thereby. Purchaser\'s Accountants shall be entitled to
participate (including, with the permission of the Sellers\' Accountant,
review of work papers) in the preparation of the Audited
Financial Statements. The costs and expenses associated with the preparation
and delivery of the Audited Financial Statements shall be borne 50% by the
Sellers and 50% by the Purchaser.   SECTION 1.2 Non-Solicitation of
Employees. (a)Neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall, for a
period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, for its own account or
jointly with another, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of any
individual, partnership, corporation or other legal entity, as principal,
agent or otherwise solicit or induce, or in any manner attempt to solicit,
any person then employed by Purchaser to leave such employment, whether or
not such employment is pursuant to a written contract and whether or not
such employment is at will, or hire any person who has been employed by the
Companies or the Subsidiaries at any time during the six (6) month period
preceding the Closing. This Section 5.12(a) shall not apply to general
solicitations that are made pursuant to advertisements in publications of
wide circulation, to hires made pursuant to such solicitations, to any hiring
made as a result of such solicitation, or to any employee earning less than
$30,000 per year. (b) Each of the Sellers (and their Affiliates) recognizes
the importance of the covenant not to solicit contained in this subsection
(a) above an acknowledges that the restrictions imposed herein are: (i)
reasonable as to scope, time and area; (ii) necessary for the protection of
its legitimate business interests, including without limitation, trade
secrets, goodwill, and its relationship with customers and suppliers; (iii)
not unduly restrictive of its rights; and (iv) supported by adequate
consideration. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the covenants not to
compete contained in this Section 5.12 are   36   essential elements of
this Agreement and that but for these covenants, the other party would not
have agreed to enter into this Agreement. Such covenants shall be construed
as agreements independent of any other provision of this Agreement.  
EMPLOYEE MATTERS   Employment Liabilities. Except as specifically described
herein, the Sellers shall assume and be responsible for all liabilities in

with claims incurred on and after the Closing Date in respect of employees of

date treatment is rendered or a service performed. Statutory worker\'s
compensation claims of any employees of the Companies and Subsidiaries who
are employees thereof at any time after the Closing or for whom reserves are
established on the Closing Balance Sheet, regardless of whether they arose
before or after the Closing Date, shall be the responsibility and liability
of the Purchaser. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume
responsibility for providing health care coverage to all
qualified beneficiaries of current or former employees of the Companies or
any Subsidiary (without regard to whether such employees become a transferred
employee) who are receiving (or become entitled to receive) continuation
health coverage pursuant to an election made under Section 4980B of the Code
or Sections 601-608 of ERISA ("COBRA") (such an election to be called a
"COBRA election") relating to a qualifying event occurring prior to or on the
Closing Date. Coverage of the employees of the Companies and the Subsidiaries
under Sellers\' employee welfare benefit plans shall cease as of the Closing

Company or Subsidiary employee with the  number of years of service

Date, in the  Purchaser\'s employee benefit plans and shall cause any waiting
periods  or pre-existing conditions restrictions under the Purchaser\'s plans
to  be waived to the extent necessary to provide immediate coverage under 
the Purchaser\'s plans. Such plans shall also credit each such employee  with
the amount, if any, paid during the plan year or calendar year, as 
applicable, by such employee (or dependent) for all deductible  payments, co-
payments, or similar payments made by each of them under  Sellers\'
corresponding plan.   WARN Act. The Purchaser shall be responsible for any
liability arising under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
arising in connection with the termination of any Company or Subsidiary
employee on or after the Closing Date.   TAX MATTERS   Indemnity. (a)
Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement or the SPAB
Asset Purchase Agreement, the Sellers agree jointly and severally to
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, the Companies and each Subsidiary
against the following Taxes (except to the extent the Closing Balance Sheet
specifically reserves for such Taxes) and, except as otherwise provided in
Section 7.4, against any loss, damage, liability or expense, including
reasonable fees for attorneys and other outside consultants, incurred in
contesting or otherwise in connection with any such Taxes: (i) Taxes imposed
on the Companies or any Subsidiary with respect to taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing Date (including but not limited to the Section
338(h)(10) Election described in Section 7.8); (ii) with respect to taxable
periods beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing
Date, Taxes imposed on the Companies or any Subsidiary which are allocable,
pursuant to Section 7.1(b), to the portion of such period ending on the
Closing Date; (iii) Taxes imposed on any member of any affiliated group with
which any of the Companies and the Subsidiaries file or have filed a Return
on a consolidated or combined basis for a taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date; (iv) Taxes imposed on the Purchaser or any of the Companies
or Subsidiaries as a result of any breach of warranty or misrepresentation
under Section 3.24. The Purchaser shall be responsible for Taxes and
associated expenses not allocated to the Sellers pursuant to the first
sentence hereof.   37   (b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends
after the Closing Date, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be:   in the case of
Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related  to income or receipts, or
(y) imposed in connection with any sale or  other transfer or assignment of
property (real or personal, tangible or  intangible), (other than conveyances
pursuant to this Agreement, as  provided under Section 7.7), deemed equal to
the amount which would be  payable if the taxable year ended with the Closing
Date; and   in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect 
to the assets of any of the Companies or Subsidiaries, or otherwise  measured
by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such  Taxes for the
entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined  on an arrears basis,
the amount of such Taxes for the immediately  preceding period), multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is  the number of calendar days in the
period ending on the Closing Date  and the denominator of which is the number
of calendar days in the  entire period, provided however, that the amount
payable in respect of  such Taxes shall not exceed the Taxes that would have
been payable if  such Taxes were calculated as of the Closing Date.  
Returns and Payments.   From the date of this Agreement through and after
the Closing Date, the  Sellers shall prepare and file or otherwise furnish in
proper form to  the appropriate Governmental Authority (or cause to be
prepared and  filed or so furnished) in a timely manner all Tax returns,
reports and  forms ("Returns") relating to the Companies and the Subsidiaries
that  are due on or before or relate to any taxable period ending on or 
before the Closing Date (and the Purchaser shall do the same with  respect to
any taxable period ending after the Closing Date). Returns  of the Companies
and the Subsidiaries not yet filed for any taxable  period that begins before
the Closing Date shall be prepared in a  manner consistent with past
practices employed with respect to the  Companies and the Subsidiaries
(except to the extent counsel for the  Sellers or any of the Companies
renders a legal opinion that there is  no reasonable basis in law therefor or
determines that a Return cannot  be so prepared and filed without being
subject to penalties). With  respect to any Return required to be filed by
the Purchaser or the  Sellers with respect to the Companies and the
Subsidiaries and as to  which an amount of Tax is allocable to the other
party under Section  7.1(b), the filing party shall provide the other party
and its  authorized representatives with a copy of such completed Return and
a  statement certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Return that is 
allocable to such other party pursuant to Section 7.1(b), together with 
appropriate supporting information and schedules at least 20 Business  Days
prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the  filing of
such Return, and such other party and its authorized  representatives shall
have the right to review and comment on such  Return and statement prior to
the filing of such Return.   The Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid when
due and payable all  Taxes with respect to the Companies and the Subsidiaries
which are the  responsibility of Sellers under this Section 7 to the extent
such Taxes  exceed the amount, if any, accrued for such Taxes as current
Taxes  payable on the Closing Balance Sheet, and the Purchaser shall so pay
or  cause to be paid Taxes for any taxable period after the Closing Date 
which are the responsibility of the Purchaser under this Agreement  (subject
to its right of indemnification from the Sellers by the date  set forth in
Section 7.5 for Taxes attributable to the portion of any  Tax period that
includes the Closing Date pursuant to Sections 7.1(a)  and 7.1(b)).  
Refunds. Any Tax refund (including any interest with respect
thereto) relating to the Companies or any Subsidiary for any taxable period
prior to the Closing Date (except for any refund included on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, which shall be the property of the Purchaser, and if paid to
the Sellers, shall be paid over promptly to the Purchaser) shall be the
property of the Sellers, and if received by the Purchaser, the Companies or
any Subsidiary, shall be paid over promptly to the Sellers. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, any Tax refund (or equivalent benefit to the Seller
through a reduction in Tax liability) for a period before the Closing Date
arising out of the carryback of a loss or credit incurred by any Company or
any Subsidiary in a taxable year ending after the Closing Date shall be the
property of the Purchaser and, if received by the Seller, shall be paid over
promptly to the Purchasers.   Contests.   After the Closing, the Purchaser
shall promptly notify the Sellers in  writing of any written notice of a
proposed assessment or claim in an  audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding of the Purchaser or of  any of the Companies or Subsidiaries
which, if determined adversely to  the taxpayer, would be grounds for
indemnification under this Article  VII; provided, however, that a failure to
give such notice will not  affect the Purchaser\'s right to indemnification
under this Article VII  except to the extent, if any, that, but for such
failure, the Sellers  could have avoided all or a portion of the Tax
liability in question.   In the case of an audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding that  relates to periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, provided that  the Sellers acknowledge in writing their liability under
this Agreement  to hold the Purchaser, the Companies and the Subsidiaries
harmless  against the full amount of any adjustment which may be   38   
made as a result of such audit or proceeding that relates to periods  ending
on or before the Closing Date (or, in the case of any  taxable year that
includes the Closing Date, against an  adjustment allocable under Section
7.1(b) to the portion of such  year ending on or before the Closing Date),
the Sellers shall  have the right at their expense to participate in and
control the  conduct of such audit or proceeding but only to the extent
that  such audit or proceeding relates solely to a potential adjustment  for
which the Sellers could be held liable hereunder; the  Purchaser also may
participate in any such audit or proceeding  and, if the Sellers do not
assume the defense of any such audit  or proceeding, the Purchaser may defend
the same in such manner  as it may deem appropriate, including, but not
limited to,  settling such audit or proceeding after giving ten business
days\'  prior written notice to the Sellers setting forth the terms and 
conditions of settlement.   With respect to issues relating to a potential
adjustment for which  both the Sellers and the Purchaser or the Companies or
any Subsidiary  could be liable, each party may participate in the audit or
proceeding.   Neither the Purchaser nor the Sellers shall enter into any
compromise  or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax audit or
proceeding  which would adversely affect the other party for such year or any
other  year without the written consent of the other party, which consent
may  not be unreasonably withheld. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to 
cooperate, and the Purchaser agrees to cause the Companies and the 
Subsidiaries to cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any  claim
in any audit or proceeding.   Conveyance Taxes   The Seller and the
Purchaser shall each pay one half of any real property transfer, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer, and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration, and other fees, and any similar Taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and shall file such applications and documents as shall permit any such Tax
to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with
any available per sale filing procedure. The Purchaser shall execute
and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Seller
to comply with the foregoing.   Miscellaneous   The Sellers and the
Purchaser agree to treat all payments made by  either of them to or for the
benefit of the other (including any  payments to the Companies or any
Subsidiary) under this Article VII,  under other indemnity provisions of this
Agreement and for any  misrepresentations or breaches of warranties or
covenants as  adjustments to the Purchase Price or as capital contributions
for Tax  purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof 
except to the extent that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide 
otherwise, in which case such payments shall be made in an amount  sufficient
to indemnify the relevant party on an after-Tax basis.   Any tax sharing
agreement or arrangement between the Sellers and any of  the Companies or
Subsidiaries shall be terminated immediately prior to  the Closing.  
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the 
obligations of the Sellers to indemnify and hold harmless the  Purchaser, the
Companies and the Subsidiaries pursuant to this Article  VII, and the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.24,  shall terminate at
the close of business on the day following the  expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect to the  Tax liabilities in question
(giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or  extension thereof).   From and
after the date of this Agreement, the Sellers shall not  without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser (which may, in its  sole and absolute
discretion, withhold such consent) make, or cause or  permit to be made, any
Tax election (other than the Section 338(h)(10)  Election) that would affect
any of the Companies or Subsidiaries.   For purposes of this Article VII,
"the Purchaser" and "the Sellers," respectively, shall include each member of
the affiliated group of corporations of which it is or becomes a member
(other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries, except to the extent
expressly referenced). Anything to the contrary in this Article VII
notwithstanding, the parties acknowledge that the capital stock of SPAB is
not being sold to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and that the
provisions of Article VII, as to SPAB shall be interpreted accordingly.  
Purchase Price Allocation The parties agree to allocate the Purchase Price as
follows: $150,000,000 for shares of common stock of SPINC, $43,000,000
for the Shares of capital stock of the SPBV Companies and $87,000,000 for the
SPAB Assets. No party will take a position on any tax return, before any
governmental agency, or in any judicial proceeding, that is in any way
inconsistent with such allocation. In the event of a Purchase Price
Adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6 of this Agreement the Purchase Price
Allocation pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be proportionately

that  the accelerated timing imposed upon the preparation, negotiation and 
execution of this Agreement, including the preparation and review of  the
Schedules hereto and to the SPAB Asset Purchase Agreement, may  have
inadvertently resulted in there being technical errors in this  Agreement and
in the Other Purchase Documents, including the Exhibits  and Schedules
thereto, and omissions or errors in the Disclosure  Schedule (which do not

faith to resolve such issues promptly upon  discovery and notice thereof,

Agreement, the Other Purchase Documents, Exhibits to this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedule and any certificate, Financial Statement, Interim
Statements or report or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement
or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the "Acquisition Documents") shall survive the
Closing until the 545th day thereafter; provided, however, that (a) the
representations, warranties, and covenants dealing with Tax Matters shall
survive as provided in Section 7.6(c), (b) insofar as any claim is made by
the Purchaser for the breach of any representation or warranty of the Sellers
contained herein relating to environmental matters, such representations and
warranties shall, for purposes of such claims by the Purchaser, survive the
Closing Date until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (c) insofar
as any claim is made by the Purchaser for a breach of the representations and
warranties specified in Section 3.3 and 3.4(d), such representations and
warranties shall, for the purposes of such claims by the Purchaser, survive
forever. Neither the period of survival nor the liability of the Sellers with
respect to the Sellers\' representations and warranties shall be reduced by
any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of the Purchaser, except
as described below. If written notice of a claim has been given prior to the
expiration of the applicable representations and warranties by the Purchaser
to the Sellers, then the relevant representations and warranties shall
survive as to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.  
Indemnification by the Sellers   The Purchaser and its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees,  agents, successors and assigns (each an "Indemnified
Party") shall be  indemnified and held harmless by the Sellers for any and
all  Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs (including Business 
Interruption Costs) and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and  penalties
(including, without limitation, attorneys\' and consultants\'  fees and
expenses) actually suffered or incurred by them (including,  without
limitation, any Action brought or otherwise initiated by any of  them)
(hereinafter a "Loss"), arising out of or resulting from:   the breach of
any representation or warranty made in this  Agreement by the Sellers, or in
the SPAB Asset Purchase Agreement by  SPAB;   the breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this  Agreement by the Sellers, or in the SPAB Asset
Purchase Agreement by  SPAB; and   (i) Pre-Closing Employee Claims
(excluding workers\' compensation  claims) and Transaction Induced Payments;
and   any Off-Site Environmental Matters or Environmental Claims or 
remediation with respect thereto arising from or in connection with  events
or conditions occurring prior to the Closing Date.   The limitations
contained in the representations set forth in Article III with regard to
events occurring prior to the Sellers\' Acquisition Date shall
be inapplicable where it is shown by a preponderance of evidence that any of
the Seller Representatives had Knowledge of the events or conditions prior to
the Sellers\' Acquisition Date that gave rise to such representation or
warranty of the Sellers being false when and as made hereunder.  
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be entitled
to indemnification hereunder pursuant to 9.2(a)(i) where it is shown by
a preponderance of the evidence that one or more of the Purchaser\'s
executive officers (who were executive officers of the Purchaser prior to the
Closing Date) had actual Knowledge prior to January 12, 2000 that such
representation or warranty of the Sellers is false when and as made
hereunder.   42    An Indemnified Party shall give the Sellers notice of
any matter which  an Indemnified Party determines has given, or could give
rise to, a  right of indemnification under this Agreement, within 15 days of
such  determination, setting out, in reasonable detail, the nature of the 
claim including, without limitation, the amount of the Loss, if known,  and
method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the  provisions
of this Agreement in respect of which such right of  indemnification is
claimed or arises. The obligations and Liabilities  of the Sellers under this
Article IX with respect to Losses arising  from claims of any third party
which are subject to the indemnification  provided for in this Article IX
("Third Party Claims") shall be  governed by and contingent upon the
following additional terms and  conditions: if an Indemnified Party shall
receive notice of any Third  Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Sellers notice of  such Third Party Claim within 15 days of the receipt
by the Indemnified  Party of such notice; provided, however, that the failure
to provide  such notice shall not release the Sellers from any of its
obligations  under this Article IX except to the extent the Sellers are
materially  prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the Sellers from
any  other obligation or Liability that it may have to any Indemnified
Party  otherwise than under this Article IX. If the Sellers acknowledge in 
writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder  against
any Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, then  the Sellers
shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such  Third Party
Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if  it gives notice of
its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party  within five Business Days of
the receipt of such notice from the  Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that if there exists or is  reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest
that would make it  inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnified  Party and the Sellers, then the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to  retain its own counsel, in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified  Party determines counsel is required, at the expense of the
Sellers. In  the event the Sellers exercise their right to undertake any
such  defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the 
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Sellers in such defense and  make
available to the Sellers, at the Sellers\' expense, all witnesses,  pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party\'s  possession or
under the Indemnified Party\'s control relating thereto as  is reasonably
required by the Sellers. Similarly, in the event the  Indemnified Party is,
directly or indirectly, conducting the defense  against any such Third Party
Claim, the Sellers shall cooperate with  the Indemnified Party in such
defense and make available to the  Indemnified Party, at the Sellers\'
expense, all such witnesses,  records, materials and information in the
Sellers\' possession or under  the Sellers\' control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the  Indemnified Party. No such Third Party Claim may
be settled by the  Sellers without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party  which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   The
indemnities provided in this Section 9.2(a) shall survive the  Closing as
described above. Except with respect to claims based on  actual fraud or
intentional, willful or bad faith breach, the parties  agree that the
indemnity provided in this Section 9.2 shall be the sole  and exclusive
remedy of the Purchaser against the Sellers at law or  equity for any matter
covered by paragraphs (a) and (b) above.   The amount of any Losses for
which indemnification is provided under  this Section 9.2 shall be computed
net of any insurance proceeds  received by the Indemnified Party in
connection with such Losses. If  the amount with respect to which any claim
is made under this Section  9.2 (an "Indemnity Claim") gives rise to a
currently realizable Tax  Benefit (as defined below) (after taking into
account the tax treatment  of the indemnification payment, including the
taxability of such  payment or the loss of current or future deductions
because of such  payment) to the party making the claim, the indemnity
payment shall be  reduced by the amount of the Tax Benefit available to the
party making  the claim. To the extent such Indemnity Claim does not give
rise to a  currently realizable Tax Benefit, if the amount with respect to
which  any Indemnity Claim is made gives rise to a subsequently realized
Tax  Benefit to the party that made the claim, such party shall refund to 
the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax Benefit when, as and if 
realized. For the purposes of this Agreement, any subsequently realized  Tax
Benefit shall be treated as though it were a reduction in the  amount of the
initial Indemnity Claim, and the liabilities of the  parties shall be
redetermined as though both occurred at or prior to  the time of the
indemnity payment. For purposes of this Section 9.2(d),  a "Tax Benefit"
means an amount by which the tax liability of the party  (or group of
corporations including the party) is reduced (including,  without limitation,
by deduction, reduction of income by virtue of  increased tax basis or
otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or  otherwise) plus any related
interest received from the relevant taxing  authority. Where a party has
other losses, deductions, credits or items  available to it, the Tax Benefit
from any losses, deductions, credits  or items relating to the Indemnity
Claim shall be deemed to be realized  proportionately with any other losses,
deductions, credits or items.  For purposes of this Section 9.2(d), a Tax
Benefit is "currently  realizable" to the extent it can be reasonably
anticipated that such  Tax Benefit will be realized in the current taxable
period or year or  in any Tax Return with respect thereto (including through
a carryback  to a prior taxable period) or in any taxable period or year
prior to  the date of the Indemnity Claim. In the event that there should be
a  determination disallowing the Tax Benefit, the Indemnifying Party shall 
be liable to refund to the Indemnified Party the amount of any related 
reduction previously allowed or payments previously made to the  Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Section 9.2(d). The amount of the  refunded reduction
or payment shall be deemed a payment under this  Section 9.2 and thus shall
be paid subject to any applicable reductions  under this Section 9.2(d).  
43    The parties agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant
to  this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to 
the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable law.   Each
Indemnified Party shall be obligated in connection with any claim  for
indemnification under this Section 9.2 to use all reasonable  efforts to
mitigate Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event  which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to such Losses.   Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, neither  Sellers nor any Affiliate
of Sellers shall be liable for any  consequential, punitive or special
damages pursuant to this Agreement  or any of the agreements contemplated
hereby, except with respect to  intentional, willful or bad faith breaches
hereof.   Purchaser shall promptly pay to Sellers any refund or credit
(including  any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) received by 
Purchaser, or any Affiliate thereof after the Closing of Taxes relating  to
any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or, with  respect to
any taxable period beginning before and ending after the  Closing Date, Taxes
relating to the portion of such period beginning  before and ending on the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall, if Sellers  reasonably so request, cause the
relevant related entity to file for  any refund or credit to which Sellers
believe they are entitled under  this Section 9.2(h).   Limits on
Indemnification Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered
from the Sellers arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in
Section 9.2(a)(i-iii) shall be an amount equal to $40,000,000, and the
maximum amount which may be recovered for events or conditions specified
in Section 9.2(a)(iv) shall be $15,000,000 and provided, however, that any
claim for indemnification with regard to Tax Matters shall be governed by
Article VII and shall not be included in such maximum amount. Other than
Claims for indemnification with regard to Tax Matters, no claim may be made
by the Purchaser with respect to indemnifiable Losses until the aggregate of
all indemnifiable Losses exceeds $2,800,000, which amount shall be deductible
from the maximum amount of indemnification, and Purchaser shall not be
entitled to recover with respect to the first $1,000,000 of Losses. The
amount of any Claim payable to the Purchaser by the Sellers in accordance
with this Agreement shall first be deducted from the outstanding principal
amount owing by the Purchaser under the Note and any remaining amount of
indemnification owing by the Sellers hereunder shall be payable in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.   Tax Matters. Anything in this Article IX
(except for the specific reference to Tax matters in Section 9.1) to the
contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with
respect to indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be governed by
Article VII.    44     Indemnification by the Purchaser.   Each of
the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, officers,  directors, employees,
agents, successors and assigns (each an "Sellers\'  Indemnified Party") shall
be indemnified and held harmless by the  Purchaser for any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs  and expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties (including,  without limitation, attorneys\' and
consultants\' fees and expenses)  actually suffered or incurred by them
(including, without limitation,  any Action brought or otherwise initiated by
any of them) (hereinafter  a "Loss"), arising out of or resulting from:  
the breach of any representation or warranty made by the  Purchaser in this
Agreement;   the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Purchaser in
this  Agreement;   (iii) any claim for severance pay, termination pay,
redundancy  pay or similar amounts relating to the termination of any
employee of  the Business on or after the Closing Date, other than with
respect to  the four employees listed in Section 2(g) of the SPAB Asset
Purchase  Agreement and any other employees who, prior to the Closing Date, 
accept employment with Thermo Electron Corporation or any of its  Affiliates;
or (iv) any claim in respect of vacation accruals included  in the Closing
Balance Sheet that is not satisfied by the Purchaser  after Closing.   A
Sellers\' Indemnified Party shall give the Purchaser notice of any  matter
which a Sellers\' Indemnified Party determines has given, or  could give rise
to, a right of indemnification under this Agreement,  within 60 days of such
determination, setting out, in reasonable  detail, the nature of the claim
including, without limitation, the  amount of the Loss, if known, and method
of computation thereof, and  containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect  of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises. The  obligations and liabilities of the Purchaser under this Article
IX with  respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party which are 
subject to the indemnification provided for in this Article IX  ("Sellers\'
Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and contingent  upon the following
additional terms and conditions: if a Sellers\'  Indemnified Party shall
receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the  Indemnified Party shall give
the Purchaser notice of such Sellers\'  Third Party Claim within 30 days of
the receipt by the Sellers\'  Indemnified Party of such notice; provided,
however, that the failure  to provide such notice shall not release the
Purchaser from any of its  obligations under this Article IX except to the
extent the Purchaser is  materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not
relieve the  Purchaser from any other obligation or Liability that it may
have to  any Sellers\' Indemnified Party otherwise than under this Article
IX. If  the Purchaser acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify
the  Sellers\' Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that may
result  from such Sellers\' Third Party Claim, then the Purchaser shall be 
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Sellers\' Third Party 
Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives  notice of
its intention to do so to the Sellers\' Indemnified Party  within five
Business Days of the receipt of such notice from the  Sellers\' Indemnified
Party; provided, however, that if there exists or  is reasonably likely to
exist a conflict of interest that would make it  inappropriate in the
judgment of the Sellers\' Indemnified Party, in its  sole and absolute
discretion, for the same counsel to represent both  the Sellers\' Indemnified
Party and the Purchaser, then the Sellers\'  Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to retain its own counsel, in each  jurisdiction for which the
Sellers\' Indemnified Party determines  counsel is required, at the expense
of the Purchaser. In the event the  Purchaser exercises the right to
undertake any such defense against any  such Sellers\' Third Party Claim as
provided above, the Sellers\'  Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Purchaser in such defense  and make available to the Purchaser, at the
Purchaser\'s expense, all  witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Sellers\'  Indemnified Party\'s possession or under the
Sellers\' Indemnified  Party\'s control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the  Purchaser. Similarly, in the event the Sellers\' Indemnified
Party is,  directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such 
Sellers\' Third Party Claim, the Purchaser shall cooperate with the 
Sellers\' Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the 
Sellers\' Indemnified Party, at the Purchaser\'s expense, all such 
witnesses, records, materials and information in the Purchaser\'s  possession
or under the Purchaser\'s control relating thereto as is  reasonably required
by the Sellers\' Indemnified Party. No such Sellers\'  Third Party Claim may
be settled by the Purchaser without the prior  written consent of the
Sellers\' Indemnified Party.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser
shall be liable for any consequential, punitive or special damages pursuant
to this Agreement or any of the agreements contemplated hereby, except with
respect to intentional, willful or bad faith breaches hereof.   (d) Each
Indemnified Party shall be obligated in connection with any claim for
indemnification under this Section 9.5 to use all reasonable efforts
to mitigate Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to such Losses.   TERMINATION AND
WAIVER   Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:   45    by the Purchaser if, between the date hereof and

under any Law relating to bankruptcy,  insolvency or reorganization; or  
by the Sellers if, between the date hereof and the time scheduled for  the
