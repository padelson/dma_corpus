to ensure compliance with the Accounting Principles and the provisions of this Agreement in connection with calculating such amounts
and to measure any differences between the Estimated Merger Consideration and the Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant
to this <u>Section 2.12</u> and the components thereof (including changes in Working Capital), and such process is not intended
to permit the introduction of judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, assumptions, conventions,

materials (an &ldquo;<u>Objection Notice</u>&rdquo;). If the Representative does not timely deliver an Objection Notice with respect
to the Closing Date Statement within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the Closing Date Statement will be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties. If an Objection Notice is timely delivered within such thirty (30) calendar day period, Parent and
the Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve each dispute raised therein (each, a &ldquo;<u>Disputed Item</u>&rdquo;)
and any resolution by them as to any such Disputed Item shall be final, conclusive and binding. To the extent any item or calculation
set forth in the Closing Date Statement is not set forth in such Objection Notice as a Disputed Item, such item or calculation
shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding on the parties. If Parent and the Representative, notwithstanding such good faith
efforts, fail to resolve any Disputed Item within thirty (30) calendar days after the Representative timely delivers an Objection
Notice or such longer period as the parties mutually agree in writing, then Parent and the Representative shall jointly engage
Alvarez &amp; Marsal or another mutually agreeable independent accounting firm capable of serving as an expert with relevant experience
in resolving such disputes, which firm is not the regular auditing firm of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Representative
(the &ldquo;<u>Referral Firm</u>&rdquo;), to resolve only any remaining Disputed Items as soon as practicable thereafter (but in
any event, within thirty (30) calendar days after engagement of the Referral Firm or such longer period as the Referral Firm may
reasonably require). All Disputed Items that are resolved between the parties or are determined by the Referral Firm will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties, absent manifest error. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the failure of the Referral Firm to strictly conform to any deadline or time period prescribed herein shall not render the determination
of the Referral Firm invalid and shall not be a basis on which a party may seek to overturn any determination rendered by the Referral
Firm. Upon the earlier to occur of (A) the agreement of the parties with respect to all Disputed Items, (B) the decision of the
Referral Firm with respect to all Disputed Items or (C) the Representative&rsquo;s failure to deliver an Objection Notice to Parent
within the 30-day period referred to above, the Closing Date Statement, as it may be adjusted in accordance with this <u>Section
2.12</u> (the &ldquo;<u>Final Closing Date Statement</u>&rdquo;), shall be final, conclusive and binding against the parties hereto.
The Final Closing Date Statement shall be deemed to set forth the final Closing Date Cash, Working Capital, Working Capital Adjustment,
the Specified Adjustment Amount, Unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses, Assumed Indebtedness and Merger Consideration, in each case,
for all purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment).</p>

offers exchanged between the parties with respect to any Disputed Item and (v) shall make its determination based solely on presentations
by Parent and the Representative which are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e. not
on the basis of independent review). For purposes of complying with this <u>Section 2.12</u>, Parent and the Representative shall
furnish to each other and to the Referral Firm such work papers and other documents and information relating to the Disputed Items
as the Referral Firm may require and that are available to such party (or its independent public accountants) from whom such documents
or information are requested. The Referral Firm shall deliver its determination of the Disputed Items to Parent and the Representative
in writing, together with a reasonable basis for its determination of each Disputed Item. The parties shall direct the Referral
Firm to deliver such final determination of the Disputed Items to Parent and the Representative within thirty (30) calendar days
after the referral of the Disputed Items to the Referral Firm. Neither Parent nor the Representative shall engage in ex parte communications
with the Referral Firm with respect to any Disputed Item until the Referral Firm issues its final determination in accordance with
this <u>Section 2.12</u>. The fees and expenses of the Referral Firm shall be allocated between Parent and the Representative in
inverse proportion to their success on the Disputed Items, i.e. that (A)&#160;Parent shall be responsible for that portion of the
fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar value of the Disputed Items submitted
to the Referral Firm that are resolved against Parent (as finally determined by the Referral Firm) and the denominator of which
is the total dollar value of the Disputed Items so submitted and (B) the Representative shall be responsible for the remaining
amount of fees and expenses, which amount shall be paid out of the Adjustment Escrow Account. For example, if the Disputed Items
total $1,000 and the Referral Firm awards $600 in favor of the Representative&rsquo;s position, then 60% of the fees and expenses
of the Referral Firm would be borne by Parent and 40% of such fees and expenses would be borne by the Representative. In the event
of any dispute regarding such allocation, the Referral Firm shall determine the allocation of its fees and expenses as between
Parent and the Representative in accordance with such allocation methodology, such determination to be final and binding on both
Parent and the Representative (absent manifest error). Except as otherwise set forth in this <u>Section 2.12(d)</u>, the fees and
expenses of the Representative and its representatives incurred in connection with the Closing Date Statement and any Disputed
Items shall be borne by the Representative, and the fees and expenses of Parent and its representatives incurred in connection
with the Closing Date Statement and any Disputed Items shall be borne by Parent.</p>

within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this <u>Section
2.12</u>, from the Adjustment Escrow Account an amount in cash equal to the absolute value of the Actual Adjustment, to be paid
solely out of the Adjustment Escrow Account. Concurrently with the payment described in the foregoing sentence, the Representative
and Parent shall promptly deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the balance of the Adjustment Escrow
Account (including any interest and other amounts accrued) established under the Adjustment Escrow Agreement, if any, to the Representative
in accordance with the terms of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement, which amount, upon receipt by the Representative from the Adjustment
Escrow Account, will be distributed by the Representative to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders in accordance with their Ownership

(subject to redaction of customary fee information). Except as disclosed to the Company, the Debt Financing Commitment Letters
have not been amended or modified in any manner that would materially affect the availability of the Debt Financing prior to the
date of this Agreement. Except as disclosed to the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or arrangement relating to the Debt Financing, other
than as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters that would materially affect the availability of the Debt Financing.
The proceeds of the Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all &ldquo;market flex&rdquo;
provisions related thereto) will be sufficient to make all Closing Date Payments on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement,
the respective commitments contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.
Subject to the Remedies Exception, the Debt Financing Commitment Letters are, as of the date of this Agreement, in full force and
effect and, to the Knowledge of Parent, represent a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Financing Sources named therein
to provide the financings contemplated thereby, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions and the Remedies
Exception. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable
on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a material breach or material default on the part
of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Debt Financing Commitment Letters. As of the date of
this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have no reason to believe that they or any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis any term of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than the Financing Conditions. The only conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the initial funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date to be included in the Debt Financing
Documents will be the Financing Conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, Parent has
no reason to believe that any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied or the Debt Financing will not be made available
to Parent on the Closing Date. Parent represents that all fees, expenses and other amounts that would become due and payable under
the Debt Financing Commitment Letters are not required to be paid earlier than the Closing Date.</p>

filing any and all written communications that are to be submitted to any Governmental Authorities in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in obtaining any approvals and authorizations which may be required to be obtained for the transactions

relating to any Antitrust Law; provided, that such copies may be redacted as necessary to address legal privilege or confidentiality
concerns or to comply with Applicable Law; provided further, that portions of such copies that are competitively sensitive may
be designated as &ldquo;outside antitrust counsel only&rdquo;; (C) keeping the Company reasonably informed of any communication
received or given in connection with any action or proceeding by Parent, in each case regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (D) permitting the Company to review and incorporate the Company reasonable comments in any communication given
by Parent or Merger Sub to any Governmental Authority or in connection with any proceeding related to the HSR Act or any Antitrust
Law, in each case regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent or Merger Sub, on one hand, nor the

judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in connection with the Debt Financing or any assistance or activities provided in

terms which are materially consistent with the terms contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (including giving effect
to any &ldquo;market flex&rdquo; provisions related to the Debt Financing), and (iv) causing the full amount of the Debt Financing

of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties thereto; (D) prevent or materially delay
the timely consummation of the Debt Financing beyond the date that the Closing is required to be effected in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement; or (E) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) less likely to occur; <u>provided</u>, that for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, may amend
or modify (or amend and restate) the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (I) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or any Person with similar roles or titles who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment Letters as of the date hereof,
(II) to amend titles, allocations and fee sharing arrangements with respect to the existing and additional lenders, arrangers,

that is not adverse to the interests of the Company. Parent shall not consent to any assignment of rights or obligations under
the Debt Financing Commitment Letters without the prior written approval of the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
Parent shall keep the Representative informed upon request in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing.</p>

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within three (3) Business Days of the date that the Closing should otherwise have
occurred pursuant to <u>Section 2.2(a)</u> hereof, (c) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the
Closing were to occur, (d) the Company and the Representative have irrevocably and unconditionally confirmed in writing to Parent
and Merger Sub that the Company and the Representative stand ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and to take such
actions necessary to do so, (e) the Company has given Parent and Merger Sub at least three (3) Business Days&rsquo; written notice
of their obligations to consummate the Closing in accordance with this Agreement, and (f) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate
the Closing on the date set forth in the foregoing notice. While the Company and the Representative may pursue both a grant of
specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief in accordance with this <u>Section 11.12</u> and the payment of
the Termination Fee in accordance with <u>Section 8.2(b)</u>, under no circumstances shall the Company and the Representative be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of (x) specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief and (y) monetary
damages in connection with this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement, including all or any portion of the Termination
Fee. The right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, none of the Company, the Representative, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement.
The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
in accordance with this <u>Section 11.12</u> shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such order or injunction. If, prior to the Termination Date, any party hereto brings any action, in each case in accordance with
this <u>Section 11.12</u>, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the Termination
Date shall automatically be extended (a) for the period during which such action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (b)
by such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may be. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall this <u>Section 11.12</u> be used, alone or together with any other provision
of this Agreement, to require any party hereto to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty of such party hereto made
herein.</p>

involving or concerning the same subject matter as the disclosed information. Each party agree to use reasonable best efforts to
return or destroy, at such party&rsquo;s option, any inadvertently disclosed information or communications to the disclosing party

the return or destruction of any inadvertently disclosed information or communications, the party returning or destroying such
