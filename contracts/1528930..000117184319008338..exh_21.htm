Transmittal properly completed and duly executed, to the Representative, and

Merger Consideration in respect of the Common Stock evidenced thereby, (B) to
each record holder of issued and outstanding Options an option cancellation
agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (" _Option Cancellation

Option Merger Consideration in respect of the issued and outstanding Options
and (C) to each record holder of issued and outstanding Warrants a warrant
cancellation agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ (" _Warrant

Transmittal and/or a properly completed and duly executed Option Cancellation
Agreement or Warrant Cancellation Agreement, as applicable, in each case

Support Agreement, the Representative or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall pay the holder of such Stock Certificate, Option or
Warrant, as applicable, an amount from the Fully-Diluted Stockholder Proceeds
as determined in accordance with _Section 2.10(c)_ in consideration therefor,
and such Stock Certificate, Option agreement or Warrant Documents, as
applicable, shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each such Stock
Certificate, Option or Warrant (other than Stock Certificates representing
Common Stock held by the Company or Excluded Shares) shall represent solely
the right to receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration, the Per
Option Merger Consideration or the Per Warrant Merger Consideration, as
applicable, relating thereto. The Company or the Representative shall promptly
deliver to Parent copies of any Letter of Transmittal, Option Cancellation
Agreement, Warrant Cancellation Agreement, Stock Certificate and any other
documentation executed and delivered by the Fully-Diluted Stockholders and
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock received by it in connection with the
Closing.

(ii)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any shares of Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Stock Certificates formerly representing shares of Common
Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Representative, they
shall be surrendered and canceled as provided in this _Article II_. If, after
the Effective Time, Option Cancellation Agreements or Warrant
Cancellation Agreements are delivered to the Surviving Corporation or the
Representative, the underlying Options or Warrants, as applicable, shall be
assigned and canceled as provided in this _Article II_.

  

  

(iii)  No interest shall accrue or be paid on the cash payable upon the
delivery of Stock Certificates, Letters of Transmittal, Option Cancellation
Agreements and/or Warrant Cancellation Agreements. Neither the Representative
nor any other party hereto shall be liable to a Common Stockholder,
Optionholder or Warrantholder for any cash or interest thereon delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.

  

  

(iv)  The Representative will deliver or will cause to be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation all surrendered Stock Certificates, Letters of
Transmittal, Option Cancellation Agreements and/or Warrant Cancellation
Agreements, if applicable, on the Closing Date. Unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law, any amount held by the Representative that remains
undistributed to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders after six (6) months
following the Closing Date shall be paid by the Representative to the
Surviving Corporation and any holder of Stock Certificates or Optionholder or
Warrantholder, who has not theretofore complied with the provisions of this 
_Article II_ shall thereafter be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the consideration set forth in
this _Article II_ , without interest thereon, but will have no greater rights
against the Surviving Corporation than may be accorded to general creditors
thereof under Applicable Law.

  

  

(v)  In the event that any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated or
destroyed and upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth below, the
Representative will issue, or will cause to be issued, in exchange for such
lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Stock Certificate the payments with
respect to such Stock Certificate to which such Person is entitled pursuant
to this _Article II_. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost,
stolen, mutilated or destroyed Stock Certificate, the Person to whom the
payments with respect to such Stock Certificate to which such Person is
entitled pursuant to this _Article II_ is to be paid shall, at the request of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, give the Surviving Corporation and Parent
an affidavit of that fact satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation and
Parent which shall indemnify the Surviving Corporation and Parent in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation and Parent against any
claim that may be made against the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Stock Certificate alleged to have
been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed and to the extent any shares of
Common Stock are held in "book entry" or other similar format, reasonable
provision shall be made by the parties hereto with respect to the surrender of
such shares and payments hereunder in respect thereof, _mutatis mutandis_.
The foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.10(d)(v)_ shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_  in respect of any Options and Warrants that are evidenced by
documents that by their terms require delivery and cancellation thereof and
the holders thereof.

  

  

   

-28-

 

    

(vi)  If payment of any portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration or
Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to  _Section 2.12_ in
respect of the Common Stock is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name a surrendered certificate of Common Stock is registered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that the certificate of Common Stock so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representative that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable. The foregoing provisions
of this _Section 2.10(d)(vi)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_  in respect of
any Options and Warrants.

  

  

(e)  Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration payable hereunder, or other payment otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement, the amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the
Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax law.
If any withholding Taxes are to be withheld (other than any backup withholding
or any employment related withholding), Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable efforts to provide written notice to the Company, no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, describing the legal basis
for, and the amount of, such withholding Tax, and the parties shall cooperate
in good faith to obtain exemption from or to otherwise reduce or eliminate
such Tax. Any amounts so withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate
Taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld,
such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to Parent.

  

  

2.11   _Redemption_. Prior to or concurrently with the mailing of the Letters
of Transmittal pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall send a notice of
redemption to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock in a form to be mutually
agreed upon by the Company and Parent to effect the redemption of the Series
A Preferred Stock as provided in _Section 2.10(b)_ and this _Section 2.11_ ,
which notice shall be delivered pursuant to and in accordance with the
Company's Governing Documents. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and take all actions and execute and deliver such
documents and instruments that are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
redemption of Series A Preferred Stock at the Closing. At the Closing,
the Company shall redeem in full the Series A Preferred Stock, and at or
prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause each Person who is a holder of
such capital stock to deliver to the Company the certificates evidencing their
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and other requisite documentation relating
thereto (including duly executed Letters of Transmittal), as applicable, and
the Company shall cancel such certificates upon receipt of such certificates
and other requisite documentation. The provisions of _Section 2.10(d)_ shall
apply in respect of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders
thereof, _mutatis mutandis_ (including with respect to any lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed Stock Certificates). At the Effective Time, all Series
A Preferred Stock shall be deemed cancelled, no further dividends, interest
or other amounts shall accrue thereon and all rights of the holders of Series
A Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate, other than the right of such
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to compliance with the preceding
sentence of this _Section 2.11_ , to receive payment of the applicable
redemption price in accordance with the Governing Documents.

2.12   _Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

  

  

(a)  As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than sixty (60)
calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) prepare a statement of
the calculation of (A) the Closing Date Cash, (B) the Working Capital, (C) the
Working Capital Adjustment, (D) the Specified Adjustment Amount, (E) the
Unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses, (F) the Assumed Indebtedness and (G) based
on the foregoing, the Merger Consideration (the " _Closing Date Statement_
"), and (ii) deliver the Closing Date Statement to the Representative. The
Closing Date Statement shall be prepared in good faith and in addition, the
calculations of Closing Date Cash, Working Capital and the Working Capital
Adjustment shall be calculated on a basis consistent with the Accounting
Principles, as applicable, and such Closing Date Statement shall include a
comparison of any differences between the calculations set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Date Statement with respect
thereto, together with reasonable supporting materials used in the
preparation of the Closing Date Statement. The parties agree that the purpose
of determining the Working Capital Adjustment and the related adjustments to
the Merger Consideration (and the components thereof) contemplated by this
_Section 2.12_ is to ensure compliance with the Accounting Principles and the
provisions of this Agreement in connection with calculating such amounts and
to measure any differences between the Estimated Merger Consideration and the
Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.12_
and the components thereof (including changes in Working Capital), and such
process is not intended to permit the introduction of judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, assumptions,
conventions, categorizations, definitions, techniques (including in respect
of management's exercise of judgment), classifications or estimation
methodologies different than the Accounting Principles or the definitions or
provisions related thereto set forth in this Agreement, as applicable. No new
class or classes of liabilities, asset reserves, or valuation allowances shall
be introduced in the preparation of the Closing Date Statement that were not
set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement. Additionally, there shall be no
additional provision or accrual or increase in any existing provision or
accrual included in the Closing Date Statement except to the extent such
provision or accrual was inconsistent with the Accounting Principles or new
facts or events have arisen before the Closing Date that, applying the same
management judgment, methodologies, practices, classification, policies and
procedures, justify such a provision, accrual or increase. If, for any
reason, Parent fails to deliver the Closing Date Statement to the
Representative within the sixty (60) calendar day period contemplated by the
first sentence of this _Section 2.12(a)_ , then the Estimated Closing
Statement delivered by the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_
shall, except as otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the
Representative, be deemed to be the Closing Date Statement for all purposes of
this Agreement, and all of the rights of the Representative under this
_Section 2.12_ shall apply to the Estimated Closing Statement, including the
right to dispute the calculations set forth therein in accordance with the
provisions set forth in this _Section 2.12_ , _mutatis mutandis_.

  

  

   

-30-

 

    

(b)  In connection with the review of the Closing Date Statement by the
Representative, Parent shall provide the Representative and its
representatives with reasonable access to the books and records, personnel,
facilities and representatives of the Company and furthermore, the
Representative shall have the right to review the work papers of Parent
underlying or utilized in preparing the Closing Date Statement and the
calculation of the Merger Consideration, in each case, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance written request by the Representative;
_provided_ , that the independent accountants of the Surviving
Corporation after the Closing, if any, shall not be obligated to make any
such work papers available to the Representative unless and until the
Representative has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless
agreement relating to such access to such work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

  

  

(c)  Within thirty (30) calendar days after its receipt of the Closing Date
Statement, the Representative shall inform Parent in writing either (i) that
the Closing Date Statement is acceptable or (ii) of any good faith objection
to the Closing Date Statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for each such objection and the specific adjustment to amounts, determinations
and calculations set forth on the Closing Date Statement that the
Representative believes should be made, with reasonable supporting materials
(an " _Objection Notice_ "). If the Representative does not timely deliver an
Objection Notice with respect to the Closing Date Statement within such
thirty (30) calendar day period, the Closing Date Statement will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. If an Objection Notice is timely
delivered within such thirty (30) calendar day period, Parent and the
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve each dispute raised
therein (each, a " _Disputed Item_ ") and any resolution by them as to any
such Disputed Item shall be final, conclusive and binding. To the extent any
item or calculation set forth in the Closing Date Statement is not set forth
in such Objection Notice as a Disputed Item, such item or calculation shall
be deemed final, conclusive and binding on the parties. If Parent and the
Representative, notwithstanding such good faith efforts, fail to resolve any
Disputed Item within thirty (30) calendar days after the Representative timely
delivers an Objection Notice or such longer period as the parties mutually
agree in writing, then Parent and the Representative shall jointly
engage Alvarez and Marsal or another mutually agreeable independent accounting
firm capable of serving as an expert with relevant experience in resolving
such disputes, which firm is not the regular auditing firm of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Representative (the " _Referral Firm_ "), to
resolve only any remaining Disputed Items as soon as practicable thereafter
(but in any event, within thirty (30) calendar days after engagement of the
Referral Firm or such longer period as the Referral Firm may reasonably
require). All Disputed Items that are resolved between the parties or are
determined by the Referral Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties, absent manifest error. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the failure of the Referral Firm to strictly
conform to any deadline or time period prescribed herein shall not render the
determination of the Referral Firm invalid and shall not be a basis on which
a party may seek to overturn any determination rendered by the Referral Firm.
Upon the earlier to occur of (A) the agreement of the parties with respect to
all Disputed Items, (B) the decision of the Referral Firm with respect to all
Disputed Items or (C) the Representative's failure to deliver an Objection
Notice to Parent within the 30-day period referred to above, the Closing Date
Statement, as it may be adjusted in accordance with this _Section 2.12_ (the
" _Final Closing Date Statement_ "), shall be final, conclusive and binding
against the parties hereto. The Final Closing Date Statement shall be deemed
to set forth the final Closing Date Cash, Working Capital, Working Capital
Adjustment, the Specified Adjustment Amount, Unpaid Seller Transaction
Expenses, Assumed Indebtedness and Merger Consideration, in each case, for
all purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment).

  

  

   

-31-

 

    

(d)  In resolving any Disputed Item, the Referral Firm (i) shall act as an
expert, (ii) shall be bound by the provisions of this  _Section 2.12_ , (iii)
may not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater than the greatest value
claimed for such Disputed Item or less than the smallest value for such
Disputed Item claimed by either Parent in the Closing Date Statement or the
Representative in the Objection Notice, (iv) shall limit its decision to each
Disputed Item and shall disregard any negotiations or settlement offers
exchanged between the parties with respect to any Disputed Item and (v) shall
make its determination based solely on presentations by Parent and the
Representative which are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set
forth in this Agreement (i.e. not on the basis of independent review). For
purposes of complying with this _Section 2.12_ , Parent and the Representative
shall furnish to each other and to the Referral Firm such work papers and
other documents and information relating to the Disputed Items as the
Referral Firm may require and that are available to such party (or its
independent public accountants) from whom such documents or information are
requested. The Referral Firm shall deliver its determination of the Disputed
Items to Parent and the Representative in writing, together with a reasonable
basis for its determination of each Disputed Item. The parties shall direct
the Referral Firm to deliver such final determination of the Disputed Items
to Parent and the Representative within thirty (30) calendar days after the
referral of the Disputed Items to the Referral Firm. Neither Parent nor the
Representative shall engage in ex parte communications with the Referral Firm
with respect to any Disputed Item until the Referral Firm issues its final
determination in accordance with this _Section 2.12_. The fees and expenses
of the Referral Firm shall be allocated between Parent and the Representative
in inverse proportion to their success on the Disputed Items, i.e. that (A)
Parent shall be responsible for that portion of the fees and expenses
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar value
of the Disputed Items submitted to the Referral Firm that are resolved
against Parent (as finally determined by the Referral Firm) and the
denominator of which is the total dollar value of the Disputed Items so
submitted and (B) the Representative shall be responsible for the
remaining amount of fees and expenses, which amount shall be paid out of the
Adjustment Escrow Account. For example, if the Disputed Items total $1,000
and the Referral Firm awards $600 in favor of the Representative's position,
then 60% of the fees and expenses of the Referral Firm would be borne by
Parent and 40% of such fees and expenses would be borne by the Representative.
In the event of any dispute regarding such allocation, the Referral Firm
shall determine the allocation of its fees and expenses as between Parent and
the Representative in accordance with such allocation methodology, such
determination to be final and binding on both Parent and the Representative
(absent manifest error). Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section
2.12(d)_ , the fees and expenses of the Representative and its
representatives incurred in connection with the Closing Date Statement and any
Disputed Items shall be borne by the Representative, and the fees and
expenses of Parent and its representatives incurred in connection with the
Closing Date Statement and any Disputed Items shall be borne by Parent.

  

  

(e)  Promptly after their receipt of the Final Closing Date Statement, Parent
and the Representative shall compute the Actual Adjustment. If the Actual
Adjustment is a negative amount, then Parent shall be entitled to receive,
promptly and in any event within three (3) Business Days after the date on
which the Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.12_ , from the Adjustment Escrow Account an amount in cash equal
to the absolute value of the Actual Adjustment, to be paid solely out of the
Adjustment Escrow Account. Concurrently with the payment described in the
foregoing sentence, the Representative and Parent shall promptly deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the balance of the
Adjustment Escrow Account (including any interest and other amounts accrued)
established under the Adjustment Escrow Agreement, if any, to the
Representative in accordance with the terms of the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement, which amount, upon receipt by the Representative from the
Adjustment Escrow Account, will be distributed by the Representative to the
Fully-Diluted Stockholders in accordance with their Ownership Percentages.
PARENT AGREES THAT ITS SOLE SOURCE OF RECOVERY UNDER THIS _SECTION 2.12_ SHALL
BE LIMITED TO, AND SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE, THE ADJUSTMENT ESCROW
ACCOUNT. If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, the Representative
shall be entitled to receive, promptly and in any event within three (3)
Business Days after the date on which the Merger Consideration is
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ , from Parent an amount in
cash equal to the Actual Adjustment, which amount, (i) shall in no event
exceed the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (ii) upon receipt by the
Representative from Parent, will be distributed by the Representative to the
Fully-Diluted Stockholders in accordance with their Ownership Percentages. THE
COMPANY AGREES THAT ITS RECOVERY UNDER THIS _SECTION 2.12_ SHALL NOT EXCEED
IN THE AGGREGATE, THE ADJUSTMENT ESCROW AMOUNT. Concurrently with the payment
described in the foregoing sentence, the Representative and Parent shall
promptly deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release
the balance of the Adjustment Escrow Account (including any interest and other
amounts accrued) established under the Adjustment Escrow Agreement to the
Representative in accordance with the terms of the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement, which amount will be distributed by the Representative to the
Fully-Diluted Stockholders in accordance with their Ownership
Percentages. Parent hereby covenants and agrees that it and the Surviving
Corporation or an Affiliate thereof shall have sufficient
immediately available funds after the Closing to make any payments to the
Representative pursuant to this _Section 2.12_.

  

  

   

-32-

 

    

(f)  Absent actual fraud, this _Section 2.12_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties hereto with respect to the determination of the Merger
Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent, the
Representative or any other Person be entitled to any duplicative recovery
hereunder as a result of the rights and remedies afforded herein.

Company Group is qualified to do business in all of the jurisdictions in
which the ownership or leasing of its properties or assets or the conduct or

Group, as presently in effect, have been heretofore delivered or made
available to Parent. _Section 3.1(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth

All Options have been granted or issued at an exercise price not less than
the fair market value of the underlying Common Stock, as determined by the
Company's Board of Directors at the date of grant or issuance, the Options
have been granted consistent with the requirements of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(5) in order to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and
no modifications have been made to such Options following the applicable

_Section 2.9_ hereof will not violate the terms of the 2015 Stock Option Plan,
the agreements with the Optionholders under the 2015 Stock Option Plan, or
Applicable Law and will not give rise to any grounds for any claim or
action by any Person against the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger
Sub or Parent.

of accrued and unpaid dividends as of the Closing pursuant to the Company's
Governing Documents, and no other amounts are payable in respect of the
Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the Closing or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

3.2   _Due Authorization_. The Company has full power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and its Related Agreements and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and its Related Agreements and the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly and validly authorized and approved and declared advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company by the board of

Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement, its Related Agreements and

of a commercially reasonable nature and in commercially reasonable amounts as

service providers of any of the member of the Company Group residing or
working outside of the United States.

  

  

(b)   _Plan Documents and Reports_. A true, correct and complete copy of each
of the documents embodying the Benefit Plans and a written description of any
material unwritten Benefit Plan has been made available to Parent and Merger
Sub. A true, correct and complete copy of the most recent annual report and

Revenue Service, Department of Labor or other Governmental Authority, in each
case, to the extent applicable, has been made available to Parent and Merger
Sub by the Company.

  

  

(c)   _Compliance With Laws; Liabilities_.

  

  

(i)  As to all Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, each such Benefit Plan is the subject of a favorable
determination letter or is entitled to rely on an advisory or opinion letter
from the Internal Revenue Service that it is so qualified and that its trust
is exempt from Tax under Section 501(a) of the Code and there are no facts or
circumstances that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to result in the loss of such Benefit Plan's qualified status or the
imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.
Except as disclosed in _Section 3.13(c)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, (i)
all Benefit Plans have been established, funded, operated and administered and
comply in all material respects with their terms and the requirements of law
applicable thereto, including ERISA and the Code; (ii) there are no
Actions (other than routine claims for benefits) pending, or to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened involving any Benefit Plan, the assets of any of
the trusts under such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan administrator, or
against any fiduciary of the Benefit Plans with respect to the operation of
such plans; (iii) no member of the Company Group has any liability under any
Benefit Plan for providing post-retirement medical benefits, other than
statutory liability for providing group health plan continuation
coverage under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of
the Code or Applicable Law; and (iv) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of the Company, any "party in interest" or
any "disqualified person" with respect to a Benefit Plan, has engaged in any
material non-exempt transaction prohibited by ERISA or by Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA with respect to any Benefit Plan. All
contributions, payments, distributions and intercompany charges required with
respect to each Benefit Plan as of or prior to the date hereof have been made
on a timely basis or properly accrued and reflected in the Latest Balance
Sheet, in each case in accordance with the provisions of each of the Benefit
Plans, Applicable Law and GAAP.

(ii)  To the Knowledge of the Company, no fiduciary (within the meaning of
Section 3(21) of ERISA) has breached any fiduciary duty with respect to a
Benefit Plan or otherwise has any Liability in connection with acts taken (or
the failure to act) with respect to the administration or investment of the
assets of any Benefit Plan. No Benefit Plan is presently under investigation,
audit or examination (nor has written notice been received of a potential
investigation, audit or examination) by any Governmental Authority. There is
not now, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, do any circumstances exist that
could give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect
to a Benefit Plan or the imposition of any Lien on the assets of any of the
members of the Company Group under ERISA or the Code.

  

  

(d)   _Compliance With Laws; Liabilities_. Each Benefit Plan that is subject
to the Affordable Care Act has been established, maintained and administered
in compliance with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including all
notice and coverage requirements, and each member of the Company Group and
each member of the Company Group's Controlled Group offer minimum essential
health coverage, satisfying the affordability and minimum value requirements,
to their full time employees (as defined by the Affordable Care Act)
sufficient to prevent liability for assessable payments under Section 4980H of
the Code. No member of the Company Group has attempted to maintain the
grandfathered health plan status under the Affordable Care Act of any Benefit
Plan. No Benefit Plan that provides health benefits is a self-insured
arrangement by any member of the Company Group or funded through a trust. No
member of the Company Group has incurred (whether or not assessed), or is
reasonably expected to incur or to be subject to, any Tax or other penalty
with respect to the reporting requirements under Sections 6055 and 6056 of the
Code, as applicable, or under Section 4980B, 4980D or 4980H of the Code.

or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA, or that is, a member of the same "controlled

Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) maintains, sponsors or contributes to, or within

required to contribute to or otherwise participate in or in any way has any
Liability or could have any Liability, directly or indirectly, with respect to
any (i) defined benefit pension plan or any other plan that is subject to
Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA (other than a Multiemployer Plan), (ii) plan
that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA, (iii) "multiple

have occurred and no circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to
result in any such Liability to any of the members of the Company Group.

to fund or otherwise set aside assets to secure to any extent any of the
obligations under any Benefit Plan. No Person is entitled to receive any
additional payment (including any Tax gross-up or other payment) from any
member of the Company Group as a result of the imposition of the excise Taxes
required by Section 4999 of the Code or any Taxes required by Section 409A of
the Code.

  

  

(h)   _280G_. As of the Closing Date, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or any of the Company's Related Agreements nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (either
alone or in combination with another event) result in any payment or benefit
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation

member, partner or to the Company's Knowledge, any employee of the Company
Group or (iii) any of the foregoing Persons' described in the immediately
preceding clauses (i) and (ii) immediate family members or any entity in
which any of such foregoing Persons owns equity interests, on the other hand
(each, a " _Specified Person_ "), other than, in each case, employment and
compensation arrangements entered into with the Company Group in the ordinary
course of business (any such Contract, an " _Affiliate Agreement_ "). Except
as set forth in _Section 3.23_ of the Disclosure Schedule, (A) no Specified

PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY BUT SUBJECT TO THE PROVISO TO
THIS _SECTION 3.25_ , EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANY SPECIFIED REPRESENTATIONS, (A) NO
MEMBER OF THE COMPANY GROUP OR ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF NOR ANY OTHER PERSON

 and _(iv)_ , as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

4.4   _Parent 's and Merger Sub's Examination_. Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective representatives have been afforded the opportunity to meet with,
ask questions of and receive answers from the management of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with the determination by Parent and Merger
Sub to enter into this Agreement and the Related Agreements and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  

  

4.5   _Investigation; Limitation on Warranties_.

  

  

(a)  Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that none of the Company or
any of its Non-Recourse Parties has made, and none of them is making, any
representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, as to the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective business or assets, except for the
representations and warranties expressly made by the Company in _ARTICLE III_
, including the related Sections of the Disclosure Schedule, and any
certificate delivered to Parent or Merger Sub hereunder and the
representations and warranties expressly made by the Company and/or its
applicable Non-Recourse Parties in any Related Agreement (including any
representations and warranties expressly and specifically made by the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders in their respective Letters of Transmittal, Option
Cancellation Agreements and Warrant Cancellation Agreements, as applicable)
(such representations and warranties, the " _Company Specified
Representations_ "). Parent and Merger Sub further agree that (i) none of the
Company or any of its Non-Recourse Parties will be subject to any liability
to Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the distribution
or use by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any of
their agents, consultants, accountants, counsel or other representatives of
any such information, including the Management Presentation presented on
September 18, 2019, and any legal opinions, memoranda, summaries or any other
information, document or material made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective stockholders, directors, officers,
agents, representatives or Affiliates in certain "data rooms," sales
memoranda, management presentations or otherwise provided in expectation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Company nor
any of its Non-Recourse Parties is making any representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any such

Affiliates has relied or will rely upon the accuracy or completeness of any
such information or any other express or implied representation, warranty or
statement of any nature made or provided by or on behalf of the Company or any
of its Non-Recourse Parties. Except with respect to breaches of any Company
Specified Representations, Parent and Merger Sub hereby waive any right that
any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective stockholders, directors,
officers, agents, representatives or Affiliates may have against the Company
or any of its Non-Recourse Parties with respect to any inaccuracy relating to
any such information or any omission by the Company or any of its Non-
Recourse Parties of any potentially material information, and Parent and
Merger Sub agree and acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its Non-
Recourse Parties will have any liability to Parent or Merger Sub, any
of their respective stockholders, directors, officers, agents,
representatives or Affiliates or any other Person resulting from the use of
any such information by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
stockholders, directors, officers, agents, representatives or Affiliates.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing set forth in this _Section
4.5_ shall limit or restrict in any way Parent's, Merger Sub's or the
Surviving Corporation's rights or remedies under the RandW Insurance Policy,
under _Article IX_ or in the case of Fraud.

  

  

   

-58-

 

    

(b)  Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it is
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby without any representation
or warranty, express or implied, by any Person, or reliance thereon, in each
case, except for the Company Specified Representations.

  

  

(c)  Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that it is relying on its own
investigation and analysis and the Company Specified Representations in
entering into the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is knowledgeable about the industries and markets in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries operate, is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and is able to bear the
substantial economic risk of such investment for an indefinite period of
time.

  

  

(d)  In connection with Parent's and Merger Sub's investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub have received from or on
behalf of the Company certain projections, including projected statements of
operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and certain business plan information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, that Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, is
familiar with such uncertainties, that Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable,
is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy
and accuracy of all such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans
so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and that Parent and
Merger Sub, as applicable, shall have no claim against the Company, its Non-
Recourse Parties or any other Person with respect to such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans. Accordingly, the Company and its
Non-Recourse Parties make no representations or warranties whatsoever with
respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts).

  

  

4.6   _Financial Capacity_.

  

  

   

-59-

 

    

(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
but subject in all respects to the provisions of  _Section 11.12_, Parent
understands and acknowledges that the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Agreements are not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to
Parent's or Merger Sub's consummation of any financing arrangement, Parent's
or Merger Sub's obtaining of any financing or the availability, grant,
provision or extension of any financing to Parent or Merger Sub. Subject to
the funding of the Debt Financing, the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Articles VI_ and _VII_ , compliance by each of the Company and the
Representative in all material respects with its covenants and other
agreements hereunder, and the accuracy of the representations and warranties
made by the Company herein, on the Closing Date immediately prior to the
consummation of the Merger in accordance with this Agreement, Parent or
Merger Sub will have cash, available lines of credit or other sources
of immediately available funds, that together with any Closing Date Cash of
the Company Group, will be sufficient to pay the Closing Date Payments in
accordance with this Agreement.

  

  

(b)  Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of
the executed Debt Financing Commitment Letters (subject to redaction of
customary fee information). Except as disclosed to the Company, the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters have not been amended or modified in any manner
that would materially affect the availability of the Debt Financing prior to
the date of this Agreement. Except as disclosed to the Company, as of the
date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or arrangement relating
to the Debt Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters that would materially affect the availability of the Debt
Financing. The proceeds of the Debt Financing (both before and after giving
effect to the exercise of any or all "market flex" provisions related
thereto) will be sufficient to make all Closing Date Payments on the Closing
Date. As of the date of this Agreement, the respective commitments contained
in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect. Subject to the Remedies Exception, the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters are, as of the date of this Agreement, in full force
and effect and, to the Knowledge of Parent, represent a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the Financing Sources named therein to provide the
financings contemplated thereby, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
Financing Conditions and the Remedies Exception. Parent has fully paid (or
caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due
and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the
Debt Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material breach or material default on the part of Parent or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
have no reason to believe that they or any other party thereto will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Debt Financing Commitment
Letters. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than the Financing
Conditions. The only conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the initial funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date to be included
in the Debt Financing Documents will be the Financing Conditions contained in
the Debt Financing Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, Parent has no
reason to believe that any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied
or the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing
Date. Parent represents that all fees, expenses and other amounts that would
become due and payable under the Debt Financing Commitment Letters are not
required to be paid earlier than the Closing Date.

  

  

   

-60-

 

    

4.7   _Litigation_. Parent is not (a) subject to any unsatisfied judgment,
order, decree, stipulation, injunction, or charge or (b) a party to any
Action, or to the Knowledge of Parent, is threatened to be a party to any such
Action, in the case of either clause (a) or (b), which would prevent or
materially delay (i) Parent's performance under this Agreement or (ii)
Parent's consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

4.8   _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the Closing, the funding
of the Debt Financing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and assuming that (i) the representations and warranties
made by the Company herein are true, correct and correct, (ii) each of the
Company and the Representative has complied in all material respects with its
covenants and other agreements hereunder and (iii) the conditions set forth in
_Articles VI_ and _VII_ have been satisfied, Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation), taken as a whole, will be Solvent. For
purposes of this _Section 4.8_ , " _Solvent_ " shall mean that, with respect
to any Person and as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the
"present fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person, will, as of such
date, exceed the amount of all "liabilities of such Person, contingent or
otherwise," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in
accordance with applicable federal laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, (b) the present fair saleable value of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, be greater than the amount that will be
required to pay the liability of such Person on its indebtedness as its
indebtedness becomes absolute and matured, (c) such Person will not have,
as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital with which to
conduct its business and (d) such Person will be able to pay its indebtedness
as it matures. For purposes of the foregoing definition only, "indebtedness"
means a liability in connection with another Person's (i) right to payment,
whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated,
unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
legal, equitable, secured or unsecured or (ii) right to any equitable remedy
for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right of payment,
whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or
unsecured.

  

  

4.9   _Operations and Assets of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and their respective Related
Agreements and has not incurred Liabilities of any nature or conducted any
business other than those incidental to its formation and existence and
pursuant to or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and its Related Agreements. Parent owns, beneficially and of record,
all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, free and clear
of all Liens (other than any Liens created pursuant to the Debt Financing and
except for any restrictions arising under any applicable securities laws or
the Governing Documents of Merger Sub).

  

  

4.10   _Guaranty_. The Guaranty is in full force and effect and assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, the
Guaranty is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
the Remedies Exception. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred,
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of the Guarantor under the Guaranty.

  

  

   

-61-

 

    

4.11   _Acquisition for Investment_. Parent is aware that the capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation being acquired by Parent pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been registered under the
Securities Act or under any state securities laws. Parent qualifies as an
"accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act, and Parent is purchasing the capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation solely for investment and not with a view toward, or
for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of
the Securities Act, nor with any present intention of distributing or selling
any of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Parent and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates will not sell or otherwise dispose of the capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation except in compliance with the registration
requirements or exemption provisions under the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other similar Applicable Law.

  

  

4.12   _Brokers and Finders_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has used any
broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Related Agreement.

  

  

4.13   _R andW Insurance Policy_. The indication letter with respect to the RandW
Insurance Policy has not been revoked or terminated. Parent has delivered to
its insurance broker, to be held in escrow pending the Closing, an order to
bind the RandW Insurance Policy. Upon the Closing and release of such order
from escrow, the insurer will issue the RandW Insurance Policy. Parent has
fully paid on or prior to the date hereof any and all premiums, fees, expenses
or taxes in connection with the RandW Insurance Policy that are required to be
paid on or prior to the date hereof.

  

  

4.14   _No Other Representations or Warranties_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY MADE BY PARENT AND MERGER SUB IN THIS _ARTICLE IV_ ,
INCLUDING THE RELATED SECTIONS OF THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, IN ANY CERTIFICATE
DELIVERED TO THE COMPANY HEREUNDER OR IN ANY RELATED AGREEMENT, (A) NEITHER
PARENT NOR MERGER SUB, OR ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF OR ANY OTHER PERSON MAKES ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO PARENT, MERGER SUB, OR ANY OTHER
PERSON OR THEIR OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES,
OPERATIONS, ASSETS, LIABILITIES, CONDITION (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) OR
PROSPECTS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE COMPANY, OR ANY

counsel, investment bankers, consultants and other representatives
(collectively, " _Parent Representatives_ "), upon reasonable notice,
reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, facilities,
information and books and records of the Company Group, and shall make the
officers and employees of the Company Group available to Parent, Merger Sub
and the Parent Representatives as Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent
Representatives shall from time to time reasonably request, in each case to
the extent that such access and disclosure would not obligate the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to take any actions that would unreasonably disrupt
the normal course of their businesses or violate the terms of any Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or any Applicable Law (
_provided_ , that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the required consent of any such third party to such Contracts or
provide such access or disclosure in a manner that would not violate the
terms of any such Contract or Applicable Law); _provided_ , _however_ , that
all requests for access shall be directed to Harris Williams in writing (the "
_Designated Contacts_ "); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that nothing herein shall
require the Company to provide access or to disclose any information to Parent
to the extent such access or disclosure (i) would cause significant
competitive harm to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, (ii)
would be in violation of Applicable Laws (including the HSR Act and other
anti-competition laws), (iii) would violate attorney-client privilege or any
similar privilege that may be applicable thereto or (iv) would entail any
environmental sampling or analysis; _provided_ , that in the case of the
preceding clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide access or disclosure in a manner that would not
result in such significant competitive harm, the violation of Applicable Law
or loss of such privilege, as applicable. Other than the Designated Contacts,
or as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, Parent is not authorized
to and shall not (and shall cause its employees, agents, representatives and
Affiliates to not) contact any officer, director, employee,
franchisee, customer, supplier, distributor, lender or other material
business relation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
earlier of the Closing Date and the date this Agreement is terminated without
the prior written consent of the Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not prohibit any contact by Parent, Merger Sub or the Parent
Representatives in the ordinary course of business unrelated to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b)  Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives shall treat and hold
strictly confidential any Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Agreement, the obligations and covenants of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Related Parties under the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate at the Closing in full and be of no further force or effect.

5.4   _Efforts_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each party hereto shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
satisfy or obtain the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each
Related Agreement as promptly as practicable, including by executing and
delivering any documents, certificates, instruments or other papers that are
reasonably required for the consummation of such transactions and by obtaining
consents, waivers and approvals from, or delivering notices to, equityholders
and third parties in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The
"commercially reasonable efforts" of the Company shall not require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, their Affiliates or representatives to
provide financing to Parent for consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

  

5.5   _Competition Clearance_.

  

  

(a)  Without limiting _Section 5.4_ , each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof
and to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional
information and documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all
other actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act as soon as practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall
request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act unless both
Parent and the Company agree otherwise.

  

  

(b)  Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand,
shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in  _Section 5.5(a)_ to
obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law,
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) keep
the other party reasonably informed of any communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")
or any other Governmental Authority and of any communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the
other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each
other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any
other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent practicable and
permitted by Applicable Law and the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended and all other federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

(c)  Subject to _Section 5.5(e)_ , in furtherance and not in limitation of
the covenants of the parties contained in _Sections 5.5(a)_ and _(b)_ , if
any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental
Authority or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or which would
otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent shall
take, or cause to be taken, all such actions as may be necessary to resolve
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner.

(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
but subject to _Section 5.5(e)_ , the obligations of Parent under this
_Section 5.5_ shall include Parent: (i) selling, divesting, or otherwise
conveying particular assets, categories, portions or parts of assets or
businesses of Parent and its Affiliates contemporaneously with or subsequent
to the Closing; (ii) agreeing to sell, divest, or otherwise convey any
particular asset, category, portion or part of an asset or business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or subsequent to the
Closing; (iii) agreeing to permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
sell, divest, or otherwise convey any of the particular assets, categories,
portions or parts of assets or business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing; and (iv) licensing, holding separate or
entering into similar arrangements with respect to its respective assets or
the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or conduct of
business arrangements or terminating any and all joint venture, strategic
partnership and other similar agreements as a condition to obtaining any and
all expirations of waiting periods under the HSR Act or consents from any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, in each case, to the extent such action is reasonably necessary to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened issuance or
enactment of any order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or
Applicable Law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby by any Governmental Authority. No actions taken pursuant
to _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ of this _Section 5.5(d)_  shall be considered
for purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any action or proceeding
is threatened or instituted by any Governmental Authority or any other Person
challenging the validity or legality of or seeking to restrain the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall
use its best efforts to avoid, resist, resolve or, if necessary, defend such
action or proceeding and shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to
participate therein. Parent shall diligently assist and cooperate with the
Company in preparing and filing any and all written communications that are
to be submitted to any Governmental Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and in obtaining any approvals and
authorizations which may be required to be obtained for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law, which assistance and cooperation shall include: (A) timely
furnishing to the Company all information concerning Parent, Merger Sub and/or
their respective Affiliates that counsel to the Company reasonably determines
is required to be included in such documents or would be helpful in obtaining
such approval or authorization; (B) promptly providing the Company with
copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental
Authority relating to any Antitrust Law; provided, that such copies may be
redacted as necessary to address legal privilege or confidentiality concerns
or to comply with Applicable Law; provided further, that portions of such
copies that are competitively sensitive may be designated as "outside
antitrust counsel only"; (C) keeping the Company reasonably informed of any
communication received or given in connection with any action or proceeding
by Parent, in each case regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (D) permitting the Company to review and incorporate the
Company reasonable comments in any communication given by Parent or Merger
Sub to any Governmental Authority or in connection with any proceeding related
to the HSR Act or any Antitrust Law, in each case regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent or Merger Sub, on one hand, nor
the Company, on the other hand, shall initiate or participate in any meeting
or discussion with any Governmental Authority with respect to any filings,
applications, investigation, or other inquiry regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any filings under the HSR Act or
any Antitrust Law, without providing the other party with reasonable prior
notice of such meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meeting or discussion. Parent shall be responsible for all filing
fees under the HSR Act. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall not permit any of their respective Affiliates to, acquire or
agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any
Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if entering into a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of, such acquisition, merger, consolidation or other transaction
would reasonably be expected to (x) impose any material delay in
obtaining, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period,
including under the HSR Act or applicable Antitrust Law, (y) materially
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (z) materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

   

-69-

 

    

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, including the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.5_ , none of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to (or be obligated to
cause any of its Affiliates or any other Person to) take any action, enter
into any Contract or perform any obligation that would, or would reasonably
likely to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse
Effect or a material adverse effect on the business, assets, operations or
condition of Parent and its Affiliates (including, after giving effect to the
Closing, the Company Group).

  

  

5.6   _Notice of Breach_. From time to time prior to the Closing, each of
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall promptly notify the other party if the first party obtains knowledge
that any of the first party's representations and warranties in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules are not true, correct and complete, to
the extent such failure to be so true, correct and complete would cause the
Closing condition in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 7.1_ , as applicable, to not
be satisfied; _provided_ , that any such notice provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.6_ shall not amend, limit, modify or otherwise affect the rights
or obligations of the parties under this Agreement and such notice shall
be provided for informational purposes only.

  

  

5.7   _Preservation of Records; Post-Closing Access and Cooperation_.

  

  

(a)  For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall preserve and retain all corporate,
accounting, legal, auditing, human resources, Tax and other books and records
of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (including any documents
relating to any governmental or non-governmental claims, actions, suits,
proceedings or investigations) relating to the conduct of the business and
operations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing Date that are required to be retained under the Company's current
retention policies.

  

  

(b)  For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall afford promptly to the Representative and its
employees and representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
described in _Section 5.7(a)_ and the offices, facilities, officers and
employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to the extent
reasonably requested by the Representative, including on behalf of any Fully-
Diluted Stockholder, and in each case solely in connection with (i) the filing
and preparation of any Tax returns of any Fully-Diluted Stockholder, (ii) any
Tax audit of any Fully-Diluted Stockholder, (iii) compliance with the
obligations of the Representative or any Fully-Diluted Stockholder under this
Agreement, any Related Agreement or under Applicable Law, (iv)
the preparation of financial statements of any Fully-Diluted Stockholder and
(v) any other purpose reasonably requested by the Representative in good
faith that is approved in writing by Parent. Such access shall be provided on
the same terms as access is granted to Parent pursuant to _Section 5.1_ ,
_mutatis mutandis_ , and such access shall be at the Representative's sole
cost and expense.

  

  

5.8   _Employees and Benefits_.

  

  

(a)  For a period of no less than one (1) year following the Closing Date,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall or shall cause an Affiliate or
assign to provide each persons who is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Employees_ ") and who remains
employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or one of their
respective Affiliates) during such period with (i) a base salary or wages,
(ii) annual cash variable/incentive/bonus pay programs (excluding any value
attributable to equity and equity-based compensation), and (iii) other benefit
plans and arrangements (other than any equity-based compensation, defined
benefit pension benefits and retiree medical benefits) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to, collectively with respect to clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii), those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Affiliates from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section
5.8_ shall not limit the obligation of any of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates to comply with Applicable Laws or to maintain
any compensation arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant to an existing
contract, must be maintained for a period longer than one (1) year following
the Closing Date. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a
guarantee of continued employment of any Employee, and this Agreement
shall not be construed so as to prohibit Parent and the Surviving Corporation
from having the right to terminate the employment of any Employee.

  

  

   

-70-

 

    

(b)  Each Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company Group and their
Affiliates (and any predecessor entities thereof, to the extent such
predecessor service is credited by Parent and the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates) before the Closing Date under any employee benefit
plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
providing benefits similar to those provided under a Benefit Plan
(including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings, medical, dental,
life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave
entitlements, post-retirement health and life insurance, termination
indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) to the same extent as
such employee or former employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to
credit for such service under such Benefit Plan for all purposes, including
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, early retirement eligibility
and early retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit accrual (other than
benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan or retiree health or
welfare plan or arrangement), except to the extent such credit (x) would
result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service, or (y)
to the extent that such service is not recognized under such employee benefit
plan for other employees of Parent and its Affiliates. With respect to the
calendar year in which Parent or any of its Affiliates ceases to maintain any
particular Benefit Plan (or to the extent an employee ceases to be eligible
to participate in a Benefit Plan as a result of actions by Parent in
connection with or following the Closing Date), Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that each employee shall be given credit for
amounts paid under such Benefit Plan for the applicable plan year for purposes
of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums (including
any lifetime maximums) as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the parallel plan, program or arrangement of
Parent or its Affiliate, as applicable.

  

  

(c)  Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive for each
Employee and his or her dependents any waiting period provision, payment
requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation,
actively-at-work requirement and any other restriction that would prevent
immediate or full participation under the welfare plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates applicable to such Employee
to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation,
actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would not have been
applicable to such Employee under the terms of the welfare plans of the
Company Group on the date of this Agreement.

  

  

   

-71-

 

    

(d)  In any termination or layoff of any Employee by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
date that is sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will comply fully, if applicable, with the WARN Act and all other
applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, including those prohibiting
discrimination and requiring notice to employees. Parent shall not, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to not, at any time
prior to sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing"
or "mass layoff" as those terms are defined in the WARN Act affecting in
whole or in part any facility, site of employment, operating unit or
employee of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries without complying
fully with the requirements of the WARN Act or similar state and local laws.
Parent and Surviving Corporation will bear the cost of compliance with (or
failure to comply with) any such laws.

  

  

(e)  This _Section 5.8_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties hereto and nothing in this _Section 5.8_ or
any other provision of this Agreement or any other related Contract, express
or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Benefit
Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall
alter or limit the ability of the Company Group, or Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates or Non-Recourse Parties to amend, modify or
terminate any Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan program, agreement or
arrangement, or (iii) is intended to or shall confer upon any current or
former employee of the Company Group or any other person any right to
employment or continued employment or service for any period of time by reason
of this Agreement or any other related agreement, or any right to a
particular term or condition of employment.

  

  

(f)  If requested by Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall adopt resolutions to terminate, effective no later
than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, any Benefit Plan that
contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section
401(k) of the Code (the " _401(k) Plans_ "). If Parent or one of
its Affiliates provides such notice to the Company, Parent shall receive from
the Company, prior to the Closing, evidence that the board of directors of
the Company or its applicable Affiliate has adopted resolutions to terminate
the 401(k) Plans (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be
subject to review and approval of Parent), effective no later than the date
immediately preceding the Closing Date. In the event that the distributions
of assets from the trust of a 401(k) Plan which is terminated is reasonably
anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees to
be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of such
terminated plan or upon the Company or plan sponsor, then the Company shall
take (or cause to be taken) such actions as are necessary to reasonably
estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in
writing to Parent prior to the Closing.

  

  

5.9   _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub will consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements or disclosures with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the terms hereof, and no party shall, without
the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) of the other parties, issue any such press release or make any such
public statement, except as may be required by Applicable
Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, The Jordan Company, L.P. and its
Affiliates may provide (a) the financial results achieved by The Jordan
Company, L.P. and its Affiliates with respect to their beneficial interest in
the Company Group or (b) a general description of the Company Group (including
their financial performance, and The Jordan Company, L.P.'s and its
Affiliates' investment and role therein), to the current or prospective
limited partners or other business associates of The Jordan Company, L.P. or
such Affiliates and their respective advisors. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall limit or restrict the ability of any Affiliate of Parent
to disclose any information regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby as may be required in connection with any filing made with
the SEC or any securities exchange or over-the-counter market.

5.10   _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  

  

(a)  For six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to jointly
and severally indemnify and hold harmless all of their past and present
officers and directors (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_" and collectively, the "
_D andO Indemnitees_") and provide advancement of costs and expenses to such
DandO Indemnitees to the same extent such DandO Indemnitees are indemnified by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or advancement of costs expenses is provided to
such DandO Indemnitees, as applicable, as of the date hereof pursuant to the
Governing Documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect on the date
hereof and to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, and Parent shall not, and
shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, amend,
repeal or modify in any adverse manner any provision in the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' Governing Documents to the extent relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of former officers and directors as in effect as of the date
hereof; _provided_ , that no such DandO Indemnitee shall have any rights with
respect to advancement, indemnification, contribution or other recovery of
any kind from Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates or FRGA Equityholders for any matter which such
indemnified director or officer is in the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction found to be liable to Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates for fraud based on the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any
Related Agreement. Solely for purposes of this _Section 5.10_ , "Governing
Documents" shall not include any stockholders agreement, equityholders
agreement, voting agreement, registration rights agreement or similar
agreement or document.

  

  

(b)  At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall, at Parent's expense,
obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies (such policies, the " _D
andO Tail Policy_") with a claims period of at least six (6) years from
the Closing Date with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on
terms not less favorable than such existing insurance coverage and at a one-
time premium, which shall be no more than 300% of the annual premium
currently being paid by the Company and in any event, the cost of the DandO
Tail Policy shall not exceed, and Parent shall not be responsible for DandO
Tail Policy costs in excess of, $80,000 in the aggregate (except with
Parent's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or
conditioned); _provided_ , that in the event that any claim is brought under
such director's and officer's liability insurance policies, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the DandO Tail Policy until
final disposition thereof.

  

  

   

-73-

 

    

(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Closing for a
period of six (6) years following the Closing Date or to the extent of any
claims under this _Section 5.10_  that are outstanding on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, until all such outstanding claims are
finally determined. In the event that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person (including the Merger), or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each case, Parent
shall make proper provision to cause the successors and assigns of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the
Company's Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.10_.

  

  

(d)  The obligations of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the
Company and its Subsidiaries under this _Section 5.10_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies without the written consent of
such affected DandO Indemnitee.

  

  

5.11   _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local, non-U.S. transfer,
excise, sales, use, value-added, registration, stamp, recording, property and
similar Taxes or fees applicable to, imposed upon, or arising out of any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Parent.

  

  

5.12   _Stockholders Action_.

  

  

(a)  The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all
action required by the DGCL and its Governing Documents to cause the
stockholders of the Company to consider and vote upon the approval of the
Merger. If, within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date hereof, any Fully-
Diluted Stockholder has not delivered any documentation or certificate
required to be delivered hereunder, including any Letter of Transmittal,
Option Cancellation Agreement, Warrant Cancellation Agreement, or stock
certificate, the Company shall exercise the "bring-along" right set forth in
the Stockholder Agreement of the Company within such fifteen (15) Business
Day period.

  

  

(b)  In addition and if required to avoid the imposition of Taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code with respect to any payment or benefit in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (i)
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers from each Person who
has a right to any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code and as to which such Person waives his or her rights to
some or all of such payments and/or benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ")
applicable to such Person so that all remaining payments and/or benefits
applicable to such Person shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), and (ii)
following the execution of the waivers described in clause (i), deliver
to its stockholders a disclosure statement intended to satisfy the
stockholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code,
soliciting the consent of its stockholders to the payments disclosed therein.
Parent shall provide the Representative with all relevant terms of any
employment Contracts or other arrangements that will be entered with the
"disqualified individuals" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) of the
Company Group on or around the Closing Date that would result in payments
and other terms (including rights to severances or signing bonuses) that need
to be approved (or disclosed) to ensure the disclosure and consent under the
previous sentence is valid. At least five (5) Business Days prior to obtaining
any waiver or soliciting stockholder approval, the Company shall provide
Parent with copies of all Section 280G-related documents, including any
Section 280G analysis prepared by the Company, the stockholder disclosure
statement, waivers and stockholder consents, for Parent's review and approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the
stockholders of the Company was solicited in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.12_ and that either (A) the requisite number of
votes were obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the " _Section
280G Approval_"), or (B) that the Section 280G Approval was not
obtained, and, as a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made
or provided.

5.13   _Financing_.

  

  

(a)  The Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take
all actions requested or required in connection with the Debt Financing and
to provide, as promptly as practicable, such assistance, cooperation,
financial, business or other information and documents (and to cause each
member of the Company Group and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its and their respective personnel and advisors to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such assistance,
cooperation, financial, business or other information and documents) as is
reasonably requested by or on behalf of Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing. Such commercially reasonable efforts to provide such assistance,
cooperation, financial, business or other information and documents shall
include, but not be limited to, each of the following: (i) furnishing to
Parent and its Financing Sources, as promptly as is reasonably practicable
following Parent's request, such pertinent and customary information
as reasonably necessary to consummate the Debt Financing (including the
historical financial information relating to the Company required pursuant to
the Financing Conditions), (ii) delivery on or prior to the Closing Date to
Parent of the Ancillary Financing Documents and any other financial, business
or other information and documents required or reasonably requested by the
Financing Sources and (iii) if requested, participation by senior management
of the Company in the negotiation of the Debt Financing Documents.
The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries'
logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_  that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to, or reasonably likely not to,
harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries, or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company, its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective personnel or advisors shall be
required to provide any such assistance which would unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company Group. Further, such assistance
shall not include any actions that the Company reasonably believes would (i)
result in a violation of any confidentiality arrangement or material
agreement or the loss of any legal or other privilege or (ii) cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached or any condition
to Closing set forth in _Articles VI_ or _VII_ to fail to be satisfied
(unless, in each case waived by the Company and the Financing Sources). All
such assistance referred to in this  _Section 5.13(a)_ shall be at Parent's
request with reasonable prior notice and at Parent's sole cost and
expense and Parent shall, upon written request by the Company, promptly
reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for any such reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses as incurred; _provided_ , that Parent shall
not be required to reimburse the Company for any costs and expenses incurred
with respect to the financial statements, financial information or other
materials prepared prior to the date of this Agreement that may be used in
connection with the Debt Financing. Such assistance shall not require
the Company or any of its Affiliates to agree to any contractual obligation
relating to the Debt Financing that is not expressly conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger and that does not terminate without liability to
the Company or any of its Affiliates upon the termination of this Agreement.
Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to make any
representation or warranty in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Closing Date. Other than with respect to customary authorization letters and
confirmations relating to the Company provided in connection with any
syndication process by the Financing Sources, neither the Company nor any of
its Affiliates shall have any obligations under this _Section 5.13(a)_
following the consummation of the Merger. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in connection with the
Debt Financing or any assistance or activities provided in connection
therewith; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that
such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties (A) result from information provided by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such information was materially
inaccurate or materially misleading or (B) result from the fraud, bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
any of their representatives acting on their behalf. All non-public or
otherwise confidential information regarding the Company and its business
obtained by Parent or its Financing Sources pursuant to this _Section
5.13(a)_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that such information may be disclosed to
"private side" lenders that agree to customary confidentiality obligations in
connection with any syndication of the Debt Financing by the Financing
Sources. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, it is understood and agreed by the parties that the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.2_ , as applied to the Company's obligations under this
_Section 5.13(a)_ , shall be deemed to be satisfied unless the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letters has not been obtained as
a result of the Company's material breach of its obligations under this
_Section 5.13(a)_.

  

  

   

-75-

 

    

(b)  Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things required to
arrange and consummate the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement. Such actions shall include using commercially
reasonable efforts to do the following: (i) maintaining in effect the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters in the form attached to this Agreement, in all
material respects, until the Closing Date (subject to Parent and Merger Sub's
right to replace, restate, supplement, modify, assign, substitute, waive or
amend the Debt Financing Commitment Letters as permitted by this Agreement),
(ii) satisfying on a timely basis all Financing Conditions that are solely
within Parent's or any of its Affiliates' control, (iii) negotiating,
executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents that reflect the terms
which are materially consistent with the terms contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters (including giving effect to any "market flex" provisions
related to the Debt Financing), and (iv) causing the full amount of the Debt
Financing to be drawn upon satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions
and the conditions set forth in _Article VI_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be permitted to amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign,
substitute or replace the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or any Debt
Financing Document in any manner which would reasonably be expected to (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, including by changing the
amount of the fees to be paid or the original issue discount of the Debt
Financing, unless the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing would still be
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent or
Merger Sub for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (B) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend
or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in
each case, in any manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the Closing; (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties
thereto; (D) prevent or materially delay the timely consummation of the Debt
Financing beyond the date that the Closing is required to be effected in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or (E) make the funding of the
Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Debt Financing) less likely to occur; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of
doubt, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, may amend or modify (or amend
and restate) the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (I) to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or any Person with similar roles
or titles who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment Letters as of the
date hereof, (II) to amend titles, allocations and fee sharing arrangements
with respect to the existing and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
agents, managers or similar entities, (III) to increase the amount of Debt
Financing thereunder and (IV) in any manner that is not adverse to the
interests of the Company. Parent shall not consent to any assignment of rights
or obligations under the Debt Financing Commitment Letters without the prior
written approval of the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld. Parent shall keep the Representative informed upon request in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.

  

  

   

-76-

 

    

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.13_ ,
nothing in this _Section 5.13_ shall be construed in any event to condition
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Closing on the receipt
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letters.

  

  

5.14   _Affiliate Agreements_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent (a) the TJC Pay-off Letter evidencing that the TJC
Management Consulting Agreement has been terminated at or prior to Closing
without any further liability to Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Affiliates and with respect to which Parent and its Affiliates
shall be express third party beneficiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding any such termination, the Company's obligations set forth in
Sections 8, 9, 10 and 12(f) of the TJC Management Consulting Agreement shall
survive indefinitely and (b) written evidence in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent that all other Affiliate Agreements (other
than those set forth on _Section 5.14_ of the Disclosure Schedules),
including all other agreements between The Jordan Company, L.P. or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company Group, on the other hand, have
been terminated without any further liability or obligation to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates and with respect to
which Parent and its Affiliates shall be express third party beneficiaries.

  

  

5.15   _Representation and Warranty Insurance_. Parent shall cause the RandW
Insurance Policy to be bound prior to or promptly after the Closing (in
accordance with the customary terms of the binder thereof). In furtherance of
the foregoing, Parent shall (a) comply in all material respects with the RandW
Insurance Policy; (b) pay when due all premiums, fees, costs and Taxes
payable thereunder including the RandW Insurance Premium; and (c) assuming the
Company's and the Representative's compliance with their respective covenants
and agreements hereunder satisfy on a timely basis all conditions necessary
for the issuance of or continuance of coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy
in accordance with its terms. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective employees, agents and
representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Parent and its representatives
in connection with responding to any additional diligence requests by any
insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy and other matters reasonably required
by such insurer under such RandW Insurance Policy to bring down and finalize
coverage under such RandW Insurance Policy at the Closing. Parent and its
Affiliates shall not terminate, cancel, materially amend, waive or otherwise
modify the RandW Insurance Policy or any of the coverage thereunder in a manner
that would reduce coverage prior to, at or at any time after the Closing (and
Parent and its Affiliates shall not take any action or fail to take any
action that would result in the foregoing). Parent shall ensure that the RandW
Insurance Policy provides that the insurance carrier(s) thereunder waives or
otherwise agrees to not bring any claim against any Fully-Diluted Stockholder
and each of their respective past, present or future Non-Recourse Parties by
way of subrogation, claim for contribution or otherwise, in each case except
in the case of Fraud.

  

  

   

-77-

 

    

5.16   _Acknowledgment_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make projections, forward looking
statements and other forecasts and estimates, and certain business plan
information, that Parent and the Merger Sub are familiar with such
uncertainties, that Parent and the Merger Sub are taking full responsibility
for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of any such
projections, forward looking statements, forecasts, estimates and business
plan information provided to (or otherwise acquired by) Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Non-Recourse Parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such projections, forward looking
statements, forecasts, estimates and business plan information).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.16_ ,
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.16_ shall not limit or restrict
in any way Parent's, Merger Sub's or the Surviving Corporation's rights or
remedies under the RandW Insurance Policy, under _Article IX_ or in the case
of Fraud.

3.5(b)_ shall be true, correct and complete in all respects (other than de
minimis inaccuracies with respect to the Company Fundamental Representations)

acknowledges that the Company shall be entitled to draw upon the Guaranty for
payment of the Termination Fee, subject in all respects to the limitations
set forth herein and in the Guaranty. If the Company commences an Action in
order to obtain payment of the Termination Fee contemplated by this _Section
8.2(b)_ as a result of Parent failing to pay the Termination Fee to
the Company when due hereunder and such Action is finally and conclusively
resolved by the entry of a final judgment (and following the expiration of
all times for appellate review) against Parent, Parent shall pay to the
Company the Termination Fee, plus interest at the prime rate of interest
reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made hereunder through the date of payment. Parent shall
reimburse the Company for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys'
fees) to the extent incurred by the Company in connection with such Action.
In the event this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent in connection with
a breach of this Agreement by the Company or the Representative, then the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_ (other than the first
sentence of this _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_ ) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ in
respect of any Actions commenced by Parent to seek specific performance or
other injunctive relief with respect to the Company's and the Representative's
obligations to consummate the Closing or for monetary damages in respect of
such breach.

  

  

Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.2(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that without these agreements, the Company would not enter into
this Agreement.

  

  

8.3   _Effect of Termination_.

  

  

(a)  In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement will forthwith become
void and have no further force or effect, without any Liability (other than as
set forth in _Section 8.2_  or this _Section 8.3_ ) on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or the Representative; _provided_ , _however_
, that the provisions of _Section 5.1(b)_ , _Section 5.8(e)_ , _Section 8.2_
, this _Section 8.3_ and _Article XI_ (other than _Section 11.12_ ) will
survive any such termination hereof; _provided further_ , however, that
nothing in this _Section 8.3_ , other than _Section 8.3(b)_ , shall relieve
any party of any Liability for any willful and material breach by such party
of this Agreement prior to such termination or fraud. For purposes of this
Agreement "willful and material breach" shall mean a material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant or other agreement in this Agreement
that is a consequence of a deliberate act or failure to act by or on behalf
of the breaching party with actual knowledge that the taking of such act or
such failure to act would result in a material breach of this Agreement.

(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
if Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing when required by _Section
2.2_ for any or no reason or otherwise breach this Agreement or fail to
perform hereunder, then, (i) except for the right of the Company to seek an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to and
in accordance with _Section 11.12_ , the Company's, the Representative's and
their respective Affiliates' sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Parent, Merger Sub and any
of their respective former, current and future direct or indirect
equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, representatives, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners, Financing Sources or successors or assignees
(each a " _Related Party_ " and collectively, the " _Related Parties_ ") or
any Related Party of any Related Party for any breach, loss, damage
(including consequential, special, indirect, exemplary or punitive
damages, diminution of value or lost profits) or other Liability whatsoever
(including in respect of any breach of or failure to perform by Parent,
Merger Sub, any Related Party or any Related Party of any Related Party) of
any representation, covenant or agreement (whether express or implied) set
forth in this Agreement, the Guaranty, the Debt Financing Commitment Letters,
the Debt Financing or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby to be consummated, shall be to validly terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions hereof and receive payment of the Termination
Fee, as provided by _Section 8.2(b)_ or pursuant to the Guaranty, as
applicable, in each case subject to the limitations set forth herein and in
the Guaranty and (ii) except as provided in the immediately foregoing clause
(i), none of the Related Parties or any Related Party of a Related Party will
have any Liability to the Company, the Representative or any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person, and none of the Company, the
Representative or any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall
be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary recovery, damages (including
consequential, special, indirect, exemplary or punitive damages, diminution of
value or lost profits) or judgment against any Related Party or any Related
Party of a Related Party, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Guaranty, the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, in each case based on whatever
theory of law, equity or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate veil or other similar theory of liability, or in respect of
any oral or written representations or warranties made or alleged to be made.
The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will Parent be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum aggregate
liability of the Related Parties and any Related Party of a Related Party
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Guaranty, the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, or the termination of this Agreement, in each case based
on whatever theory of law, equity or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate veil or other similar theory of
liability, or in respect of any oral or written representations or warranties
made or alleged to be made, shall in no event exceed the Termination Fee.

  

  

(d)  The Company and the Representative acknowledge and agree that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that without these agreements, Parent
and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.

warranty. Each and every covenant, undertaking or agreement contained in this

11.11   _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATED AGREEMENTS IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATED
AGREEMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY
LITIGATION INVOLVING THE FINANCING SOURCES. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.11_.

  

  

11.12   _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that any breach of this Agreement would not be adequately
compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Each of the Company and
the Representative agrees that Parent shall have the right, in addition to
any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce the
rights and the obligations of the Company and the Representative hereunder
not only by an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions
for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief.
Furthermore, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the Company and the
Representative shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in its favor, to enforce the rights and the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages
but also by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or
other equitable relief; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the parties hereto agree that the Company and the
Representative shall have the right to enforce Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to consummate the Closing
by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief, if and only in the event that (a) all of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ have been and continue to be satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of
which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (b) Parent and Merger Sub
fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within
three (3) Business Days of the date that the Closing should otherwise
have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ hereof, (c) the Debt Financing has
been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Closing were to occur,
(d) the Company and the Representative have irrevocably and unconditionally
confirmed in writing to Parent and Merger Sub that the Company and the
Representative stand ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and to
take such actions necessary to do so, (e) the Company has given Parent and
Merger Sub at least three (3) Business Days' written notice of their
obligations to consummate the Closing in accordance with this Agreement, and
(f) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Closing on the date set
forth in the foregoing notice. While the Company and the Representative may
pursue both a grant of specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief in accordance with this _Section 11.12_ and the payment
of the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.2(b)_ , under no
circumstances shall the Company and the Representative be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of (x) specific performance, injunctive
and/or other equitable relief and (y) monetary damages in connection with
this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement, including all or any
portion of the Termination Fee. The right of specific performance and other
equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without that right, none of the Company, the
Representative, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have
an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section 11.12_ shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. If, prior to the Termination Date, any party hereto brings any
action, in each case in accordance with this _Section 11.12_ , to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended (a) for the
period during which such action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or
(b) by such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action, as the case may be. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall this _Section 11.12_ be used,
alone or together with any other provision of this Agreement, to require any
party hereto to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty of such
party hereto made herein.

11.13   _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof
is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making
the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after
the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

  

  

11.14   _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed
as mutually chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, unless the
context requires otherwise.

11.15   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and
such counterparts may be delivered in electronic format (including by fax and
email). Such delivery of counterparts shall be conclusive evidence of the
intent to be bound hereby and each such counterpart, including those
delivered in electronic format, and copies produced therefrom shall have the
same effect as an originally signed counterpart. To the extent applicable,
the foregoing constitutes the election of the parties to invoke any law
authorizing electronic signatures.

  

  

11.16   _Legal Representation_.

  

  

(a)  Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) acknowledges and agrees that Mayer Brown
LLP (" _Mayer Brown_ ") has acted as counsel for the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders, the Representative and the Company in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Transaction
Engagement_ "), and in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, Mayer Brown has not acted as counsel for any
other Person, including Parent.

  

  

(b)  Only the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the Representative, the Company and
their respective Affiliates shall be considered clients of Mayer Brown in the
Transaction Engagement. Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) acknowledges and
agrees that all confidential communications between the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders, the Representative, the Company and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Mayer Brown, on the other hand, in the
course of the Transaction Engagement, and any attendant attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection, and expectation of client
confidentiality applicable thereto, shall be deemed to belong solely to the
Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the Representative and their respective
Affiliates (other than the Company), and not the Company, and shall not pass
to or be claimed, held, or used by Parent or the Company (or, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) upon or after the Closing. Accordingly,
Parent shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of
Mayer Brown to the extent relating to the Transaction Engagement, whether or
not the Closing occurs. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon
and after the Closing, (i) to the extent that files of Mayer Brown in respect
of the Transaction Engagement constitute property of the client, only the
Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the Representative, and their respective
Affiliates shall hold such property rights and (ii) Mayer Brown shall have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications
or files to the Company (or, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) or
Parent by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Mayer Brown and
the Company or otherwise, unless and to the extent that the Representative
waives, on behalf of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the attorney-client
privilege with respect thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Mayer Brown shall not disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to any third parties (other than
representatives, accountants and advisors of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders
and their respective Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that such
representatives, accountants and advisors are instructed and agree to
maintain the confidence of such attorney-client communications). Parent, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation) irrevocably waives any right it may have to discover or
obtain information or documentation relating to the Transaction Engagement,
to the extent that such information or documentation was subject to an
attorney-client privilege or work product protection owed to the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders, the Representative and/or their respective
Affiliates, except to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by
Mayer Brown to a third party. If and to the extent that, at any time
subsequent to the Closing, Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) shall have the right to assert or
waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between
the Company or its Affiliates and any Person representing them that occurred
at any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) shall be
entitled to waive such privilege only with the prior written consent of the
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld); _provided_ ,
that in connection with any third party Action not involving the
Representative, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders or their respective Affiliates
relating to this Agreement or the Related Agreements, Parent shall be
entitled to waive any attorney-client privilege, attorney work product
protection and expectation of client confidentiality without the consent of
any Person.

(c)  Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) acknowledges and agrees that Mayer Brown
has acted as counsel for certain of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the
Representative, the Company and their respective Affiliates for several years
and that such Fully-Diluted Stockholders and such Representative reasonably
anticipate that Mayer Brown will continue to represent them and/or their
respective Affiliates in future matters. Accordingly, Parent, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation) expressly (i) consents to Mayer Brown's representation of the
Fully-Diluted Stockholders and the Representative and/or their respective
Affiliates and/or any of their respective agents (if any of the foregoing
Persons so desire) in any matter, including any post-Closing matter in which
the interests of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and
the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the Representative or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse, including any matter relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and whether or not such
matter is one in which Mayer Brown may have previously advised the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders, the Representative, the Company or their respective
Affiliates and (ii) consents to the disclosure by Mayer Brown to the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders, the Representative or their respective Affiliates of
any information learned by Mayer Brown in the course of its representation of
the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the Representative, the Company or their
respective Affiliates, whether or not such information is subject to
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, or Mayer Brown's
duty of confidentiality.

  

  

(d)  Each of the parties understands and agrees that it has undertaken
reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of communications among Mayer
Brown, on the one hand, and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the
Representative, the Company and their Affiliates, on the other hand, in
connection with the Transaction Engagement. Notwithstanding those efforts, the
parties understand and agree that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement could result in the inadvertent disclosure of
information or communications that may be confidential, eligible to be
subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege, or otherwise protected from
disclosure. The parties further understand and agree that, except as otherwise
set forth in this _Section 11.16_ , any such inadvertent disclosure of such
information or communications that may be confidential, subject to a claim of
attorney-client privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure will not
constitute a waiver of or otherwise prejudice any claim of
confidentiality, attorney-client privilege, or protection from disclosure,
including, but not limited to, with respect to information or
communications involving or concerning the same subject matter as the
disclosed information. Each party agree to use reasonable best efforts
to return or destroy, at such party's option, any inadvertently disclosed
information or communications to the disclosing party promptly upon becoming
aware of its existence from such other party or other parties. The parties
further agree that promptly after the return or destruction of any
inadvertently disclosed information or communications, the party returning or
destroying such information or communications shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to return or destroy, at the returning party's
election, any and all copies, summaries, descriptions and/or notes of such
inadvertently disclosed information or communications, including electronic
versions thereof, and all portions of larger documents or communications that
contain such copies, summaries, descriptions and/or notes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the non-disclosing party may retain such information and
documentation as required by Applicable Law or otherwise in accordance with
such party's bona fide document retention and electronic backup policies.

  

  

   

-93-

 

    

(e)  From and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall cease to
have any attorney-client relationship with Mayer Brown, unless and to the
extent Mayer Brown is expressly engaged in writing by the Surviving
Corporation to represent the Surviving Corporation after the Closing and
either (i) such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to
the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the Representative and/or any of their
respective Affiliates or (ii) the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the
Representative and/or any such Affiliate, as applicable, consent in writing
to such engagement. Any such representation of the Surviving Corporation by
Mayer Brown after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 11.16_.

  

  

(f)  Each of the parties to this Agreement consents to the arrangements in
this _Section 11.16_ and waives any actual or potential conflict of interest
that may be involved in connection with any representation by Mayer Brown
permitted hereunder.

  

  

11.17   _Authority and Rights of the Representative; Limitations on
Liability_.

  

  

(a)  The Representative is hereby irrevocably appointed, authorized and
empowered to act by the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, collectively, upon and by
virtue of the Stockholder Written Consent or acceptance of any consideration
pursuant to this Agreement, and shall have all such powers and authority (as
exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact) as are necessary or appropriate to carry
out the functions and with respect to all actions and matters to be acted
upon by the Fully-Diluted Stockholders or the Representative under
this Agreement and the Related Agreements. All actions, notices,
communications and determinations by the Representative to carry out such
functions shall conclusively be deemed to have been authorized by, and shall
be binding upon, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders. Neither the Representative
nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or
Affiliates will have any liability to the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Fully-Diluted Stockholders with respect to actions taken or omitted to
be taken by the Representative in such capacity (or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates in connection
therewith), except with respect to the Representative's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Representative shall be entitled to engage such
counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary
in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function
hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the
Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons. The foregoing shall in no way limit the rights of the
Representative pursuant to the Stockholder Support Agreement. In furtherance
(and not in limitation) of the foregoing, the Representative shall have the
power and authority, to take any and all actions which it deems necessary,
appropriate or advisable (in the Representative's sole discretion) in
connection with this Agreement, any Related Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including to: (i) negotiate and agree to any
waiver or modification to this Agreement or any Related Agreement; (ii) give
and receive all payments, notices and other communications or documents on
behalf of any Fully-Diluted Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement and the
Related Agreements; (iii) execute and deliver all documents and other
writings; and (iv) assert, pursue, litigate, compromise or settle, on behalf
of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, any Action among Parent or its Affiliates
and any Fully-Diluted Stockholder.

  

  

   

-94-

 

    

(b)  The Representative shall have the right to recover from, in its sole
discretion, the Representative Holdback Amount, prior to any distribution to
the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the Representative's documented reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of its duties hereunder as
well as any amounts owed to an Indemnified Person relating to the
Special Liability Matter (" _Charges_ "), including those resulting from the
employment of financial advisors, attorneys, auditors and other advisors and
agents assisting in the assessment of arbitration, litigation and settlement
of any disputes arising under this Agreement. In the event the remaining
Representative Holdback Amount is at any time insufficient to satisfy the
Charges, then each Fully-Diluted Stockholder will be obligated (severally) to
pay its Ownership Percentage of such deficit. Upon final resolution of all
liabilities and obligations of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders and full
reimbursement of all Charges of the Representative as provided herein, in
each case, as determined in the Representative's sole discretion, the
Representative shall distribute any remaining portion of the Representative
Holdback Amount to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, which amount will be
distributed by the Representative to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders in its
sole discretion.

  

  

(c)  Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries
shall have the right to conclusively rely upon all actions taken or omitted
to be taken by the Representative pursuant to this Agreement and any Related
Agreement, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon
the Fully-Diluted Stockholders. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Subsidiaries are entitled to deal exclusively with the
Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement and the Related
Agreements following the Closing. Any action taken or not taken, or decisions,
communications or writings made, given or executed by the Representative
shall be deemed an action taken or not taken, or decisions, communications or
writings made, given or executed by the Fully-Diluted Stockholders. Any
notice or communication delivered by Parent to the Representative shall be
deemed to have been delivered to all Fully-Diluted Stockholders. Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries are
hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person resulting from any decision,
act, omission, consent or instruction of the Representative and for relying
on such decision, act, omission, consent or instruction of the Representative.

  

  

11.18   _Non-Recourse_.

  

  

(a)  Except with respect to Actions arising under the RandW Insurance Policy or
any Related Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
Action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, may only be brought against the entities that are
expressly named as parties and signatories hereto and then only with respect
to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such parties. No
Person who is not a named party and signatory to this Agreement, including any
Non-Recourse Party, shall have any Liability under this Agreement (including
in respect of any Liability of any party under this Agreement) or for any
Action based on, in respect of or by reason of this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any alleged nondisclosure or
misrepresentations made by any such Persons, in each case, regardless of the
legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be
imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in
equity, or otherwise.

  

  

   

-95-

 

    

(b)  Without limiting clause (a) above, and without limiting any rights
Parent may have against any Financing Source under any Debt Financing
Commitment Letter, no Financing Source shall have any liability to the Company
Group, The Resolute Fund III, L.P., The Jordan Company, L.P. or any of their
respective Affiliates for any obligations or liabilities of Parent or for any
claim (whether at law or in equity, tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Without prejudice to the Company's rights in _Section 5.13(b)_ , in
no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates (i) seek to enforce this
Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or
seek to recover monetary damages from, any Financing Source or (ii) seek to
enforce the Debt Financing or any Debt Financing Commitment Letter against,
make any claims for breach of the Debt Financing or any Debt Financing
Commitment Letter against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or
otherwise sue, any Financing Source for any reason, including in connection
with the Debt Financing or the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or
the obligations of the Financing Sources thereunder.
