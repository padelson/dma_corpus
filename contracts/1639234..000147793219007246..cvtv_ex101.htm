Section 3.10 _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) Section 3.10 of the Target Schedule of Exceptions contains a true and
complete list of each Target Plan (as defined below). As used herein, the term
" _Target Plan_ " means each material employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (" _ERISA_ "), including each "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA), and each "employee welfare benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), each material employee benefit plan
maintained outside the United States (such as social security insurance in
China), and each other material plan, arrangement or policy (written or oral)
to provide benefits, other than salary or commissions, as compensation for
services rendered, including, without limitation, employment agreements,
executive compensation agreements, incentive arrangements, salary
continuation, stock option, stock grant or stock purchase rights, phantom
rights, deferred compensation, bonus, severance policies or agreements,
retention policies or agreements, change in control policies or agreements,
fringe benefits or other employee benefits, in each case maintained or
sponsored by Target or any of its Subsidiaries or to which Target or any of
its Subsidiaries contributes to or for which Target or any of its Subsidiaries
has or may have any liability, contingent or otherwise, either directly or as
a result of a Target ERISA Affiliate, or any other plan, arrangement or policy
mandated by applicable Law, for the benefit of any current, former or retired
employee, officer, consultant, independent contractor or director of Target,
its Subsidiaries or any Target ERISA Affiliate (collectively, the " _Target
Employees_ "). Target has made available to Parent copies of all material
documents constituting the Target Plans, the three most recently filed Forms
5500 for such Target Plans and financial statements attached thereto, all
Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") determination letters for the Target
Plans, all notices that were issued within the preceding three years by the
IRS, Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Body with respect to the
Target Plans, all employee manuals or handbooks containing personnel or
employee relations policies, and all other material documents relating to the
Target Plans. For purposes of this Section 3.10, the term Target includes any
Target ERISA Affiliate. The term "Target ERISA Affiliate" means any person,
that together with Target, is or was at any time treated as a single employer
under section 414 of the Code or section 4001 of ERISA and any general
partnership of which Target is or has been a general partner.



(b) Each Target Plan has been operated and administered in all respects in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including, but not limited to,
ERISA and the Code, except for instances of noncompliance that would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Target Material Adverse Effect. All
reporting, disclosure and notice requirements under ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws have been fully and completely satisfied with respect to each
Target Plan, except for instances of noncompliance that would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Target Material Adverse Effect. With
respect to each Target Plan, there has occurred no non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" (within the meaning of section 4975 of the Code or section 406 of
ERISA) or breach of any fiduciary duty described in section 404 of ERISA that
could, if successful, result in any liability, direct or indirect, for Target
or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Target, any stockholder,
officer, director or employee of Target or any of its Subsidiaries, except for
instances of noncompliance that would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Target Material Adverse Effect. There are no pending or
threatened claims by or on behalf of any Target Plan, or by or on behalf of
any participants or beneficiaries of any Target Plans under ERISA or
applicable Law, or claiming benefit payments other than those made in the
ordinary operation of such plans. To the Knowledge of Target, no Target Plan
is presently under investigation, audit or examination by any Governmental
Body, and no matters are pending with respect to any Target Plan under any IRS
program.

(c) Each Target Plan intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the
Code, and the trust forming a part thereof, has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS as to its qualification under the Code and
to the effect that each such trust is exempt from taxation under section
501(a) of the Code, or has an opinion letter from the IRS to the same effect,
and each such determination or opinion letter remains in effect and has not
been revoked. Except as disclosed on Section 3.10(a) of the Target Schedule of
Exceptions, Target and its Subsidiaries have never maintained, sponsored or
had any liability with respect to any other plan subject to the requirements
of section 401(a) of the Code. To the Knowledge of Target, nothing has
occurred since the date of such determination letter that could cause the loss
of such qualification or tax-exempt status or the imposition of any liability,
lien, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code. Each Target Plan has been timely
amended to comply with applicable Law.



(d) Target and its Subsidiaries do not sponsor, maintain or contribute to, and
have never sponsored, maintained or contributed to, or had any liability with
respect to, any employee benefit plan subject to section 302 of ERISA, section
412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. None of the Target Plans is a
multiemployer plan (as defined in section 3(37) of ERISA). Target and its
Subsidiaries do not contribute to, and have never contributed to or had any
other liability with respect to, a multiemployer plan or with respect to any
plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not
under common Control. There is not now, and to the Knowledge of Target there
are no existing circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to Target Plan or
the imposition of any pledge, lien, security interest or encumbrance on assets
of Target or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code, or similar Laws
of foreign jurisdictions.



(e) The execution, delivery and performance by Target of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either
alone or upon occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) (i)
constitute an event under any Target Plan or any trust or loan related to any
of those plans or agreements that will or may result in a prohibition of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any payment, acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Target Employee, or (ii)
result in the triggering or imposition of any restrictions or limitations on
the right of Target to amend or terminate any Target Plan. No Target Plan,
program, agreement or other arrangement, either individually or collectively,
provides for any payment or benefits becoming due to any director or employee
of Target that will be considered an "excess parachute payment" under section
280G of the Code. Target and its Subsidiaries have not declared any bonus
compensation in contemplation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No payments or benefits under any Target Plan or other agreement of
Target or any of its Subsidiaries are, or are expected to be, subject to the
disallowance of a deduction under section 162(m) of the Code. Target and its
Subsidiaries do not have any obligation to indemnify, hold harmless or gross-
up any individual with respect to any excise tax, penalty tax or interest
under section 280G or 409A of the Code. Each Target Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in section 409A(d)(1) of
the Code) is in documentary compliance with the requirements of section 409A
of the Code. Each nonqualified deferred compensation plan has been operated
since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with section 409A of the Code.
No option (other than an option the terms of which comply with the
requirements of section 409A of the Code) has an exercise price that has been
or may be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock as of the
date such option was granted or has any feature for the deferral of
compensation that could render the grant subject to section 409A of the Code.



(f) With respect to any Target Plan that is a group health plan (within the
meaning of section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code), such Target Plan complies, and in
each and every case has complied, with all requirements of section 4980B of
the Code, ERISA, Title XXII of the Public Health Service Act, the applicable
provisions of the Social Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, and other applicable Laws, except for instances of
noncompliance that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Target
Material Adverse Effect. No Target Plan provides health or other benefits
after an employee's or former employee's retirement or other termination of
employment except as required under section 4980B of the Code.

each of its Subsidiaries are required to pay as contributions to the Target
Plans as of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of each of the Target
Plans; all benefits accrued under any funded or unfunded Target Plan have been
paid, accrued or otherwise adequately reserved in accordance with GAAP; and
all monies withheld from employee paychecks with respect to the Target Plans

statements of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated therein
(subject to normal period-end adjustments).



(b) Parent's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure that
material information relating to Parent is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within the Parent.



(c) Since April 30, 2019, Parent has not disclosed to Parent's independent
registered accounting firm and the audit committee of Parent's Board of
Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting or (ii)

employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal control over

Parent has not identified any material weaknesses in the design or operation
of its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). To the Knowledge of Parent,
there is no reason to believe that its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 when next due. Parent maintains a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and

transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorizations; (ii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization; and (iii) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.



(e) Parent does not have any liabilities of any nature, except liabilities
that (i) are accrued or reserved against in the most recent financial
statements included in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof
or are reflected in the notes thereto, (ii) were incurred in the ordinary
course of business since the date of such financial statements, (iii) are
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iv) have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement
in the ordinary course of business, or (v) would not, or would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Section 5.7(f) of the Parent Schedule of Exceptions sets forth
a list of all outstanding debt for money borrowed, the applicable lender,
interest rate and the applicable payment dates.



(f) Each of the "principal executive officer" of Parent (as defined in
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and the "principal financial officer" of Parent
(as defined in Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ) has made all certifications
required by Sections 302 and 906 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any related
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the SEC Reports
and the statements contained in any such certifications were true and accurate
as of the date such certifications were made and have not been modified or
withdrawn.
