not more than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to the Buyer a closing statement setting forth the Companys
good faith estimate of Working Capital as of 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time on the

and the Buyer shall cause the Company to, prepare and deliver to the Sellers
Representative (A) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and

following delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Working Capital
Statement and during any period of dispute with respect thereto thereafter,
the Company and the Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative and
its representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to
the books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents to the extent such materials are in the possession of the Buyer or
any of its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Subsidiaries) and
access thereto may be granted without obtaining the consent of a third party),
supporting data, facilities and employees of the Buyer, the Company and the
Subsidiaries solely to the extent necessary 



 

\- 17 -  for purposes of their review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Working Capital Statement.

(ii) If the Sellers Representative disputes the accuracy of the Closing
Working Capital set forth on the Closing Working Capital Statement (it being
understood and agreed that the Sellers Representative may dispute the
underlying items on the Closing Balance Sheet from which the Closing Working
Capital is derived and not solely the derivation thereof), the Sellers
Representative shall provide written notice of such dispute to the Buyer no
later than forty-five (45) days following delivery of the Closing Working
Capital Statement (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail those items that the Sellers Representative disputes (it
being agreed that the Sellers Representative may not dispute the definition
of Working Capital or the related definitions referred to therein), and the
amounts of any adjustments that are necessary in the Sellers
Representatives judgment for the computations contained in the Closing
Working Capital Statement to conform to the requirements of this Agreement,
and the basis for the Sellers Representatives suggested adjustments. The
Sellers Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items
and amounts set forth in the Closing Working Capital Statement. During the
thirty (30) day period following delivery of a Dispute Notice, the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall negotiate in good faith with a view to
resolving their disagreements over the disputed items, and the provisions of
Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state
rule regarding inadmissibility of offers to compromise and of statements made
in compromise negotiations when offered to prove liability for, invalidity of,
or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount shall apply to
all such negotiations (unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative). If the Buyer and the Sellers Representative
resolve their differences over the disputed items in accordance with the
foregoing procedure, the Final Closing Working Capital shall be deemed to be
the amount agreed upon by them and reflected in a written statement setting
forth the amount of the Final Closing Working Capital signed by the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative. If the parties fail to resolve their differences
over all of the disputed items within such thirty (30) day period, then (A)
each of the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall, within five (5)
Business Days, deliver to the other a statement (the " _Closing Working
Capital Final Proposal_ ") setting forth the Buyers or the Sellers
Representatives, as applicable, final proposal with respect to the Closing
Working Capital which shall be binding on such party for purposes of the
expense allocation set forth in _Section 1.4(b)(iii)_ (it being understood
and agreed that the Buyer may not propose an amount for any line item
indicating lower Closing Working Capital than the amount for such line item
in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Sellers Representative may
not propose an amount for any line item indicating higher Closing Working
Capital than the amount for such line item (if any) in the Dispute Notice),
and (B) upon the written request of either the Buyer or the Sellers
Representative after delivery of the Closing Working Capital Final Proposals,
both the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall, within ten (10) Business
Days after the receipt of such request, submit all unresolved disputed items
(and only such unresolved disputed items, which for the avoidance of doubt
shall include all unresolved disputed items existing in the Closing Working
Capital Final Proposals) to Grant Thornton LLP (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_
") to make a binding determination as to such unresolved 



 

\- 18 -  disputed items in accordance with this Agreement. If the Sellers
Representative does not timely deliver a Dispute Notice, the Closing Working
Capital set forth in the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to
be the Final Closing Working Capital.

(iii) The Accounting Arbitrator will be requested, as a term of its
engagement, to render its written decision with respect to all disputed items
(and only with respect to any unresolved disputed items) submitted to it no
more than sixty (60) days from the date of referral or as soon as practicable
thereafter. Such written decision (A) shall be delivered to both the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative, (B) shall set forth the Accounting Arbitrators
determination of the unresolved items submitted to it, and (C) shall be final
and binding upon the parties and enforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction. The Buyer and the Sellers Representative are each entitled to
submit to the Accounting Arbitrator a statement and supporting materials
setting forth such partys position with respect to the unresolved items
submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator, and the Accounting Arbitrator shall
review such submissions and shall render its determination based solely on
such submissions (and not on the basis of an independent review) and in
accordance with the definitions, guidelines and procedures set forth in this
Agreement. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Arbitrator may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either the Buyer or the Sellers Representative or less than the
least value for such item claimed by either the Buyer or the Sellers
Representative. The Closing Working Capital set forth on the Closing Working
Capital Statement, as adjusted to reflect the negotiated resolution of
disputed items by the Buyer and the Sellers Representative and the resolution
of all other disputed items by the Accounting Arbitrator shall be deemed to
be the Final Closing Working Capital. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be paid by the Sellers, provided that such fees and expenses
shall be paid by the Buyer in the event that the Closing Working Capital set
forth in the Closing Working Capital Final Proposal delivered by the Buyer
differs from Final Closing Working Capital as ultimately determined by the
Accounting Arbitrator in an amount that is greater than the amount by which
the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing Working Capital Final
Proposal delivered by the Sellers Representative differs from Final Closing
Working Capital as ultimately determined by the Accounting Arbitrator. In the
event that the Sellers are responsible for such fees and expenses, such fees
and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator due from the Sellers pursuant to
this _Section 1.4(b)(iii)_ shall be deducted from the Escrow Amount (in which
event the Buyer and the Sellers Representative agree to provide joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release such amounts to the
Buyer), and no Person may seek such amounts directly from the Sellers.

(c) _Payment to the Buyer_. If the Estimated Closing Working Capital is
greater than the Final Closing Working Capital, then an amount equal to (i)
the Estimated Closing Working Capital,  _less_ (ii) the Final Closing Working
Capital (the " _Working Capital Shortfall_ ") shall be due to the Buyer
individually and ratably (and not jointly and severally) from the Sellers in
accordance with their respective Fractions. A distribution of an amount of up
to $1,000,000 less any fees of the Accounting Arbitrator deducted from the
Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ (the " _Working Capital Basket_ ")
that is equal to the Working Capital Shortfall from the Escrow Fund shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for the Buyer for 



 

\- 19 -  payment of any Working Capital Shortfall up to the amount of the Working
Capital Basket (and the portion of the funds held in the Escrow Fund equal to
such portion of the Working Capital Shortfall shall be the Buyers sole and
exclusive source of recovery for such amounts). For any amount of Working
Capital Shortfall in excess of Working Capital Basket, the Buyer shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to deduct such amounts from the Escrow
Fund or seek such amounts directly from the Sellers individually and ratably
based on each such Sellers Fraction (and not jointly and severally). In the
event that any amount is to be deducted from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this
_Section 1.4(c)_, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative agree to provide
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release such amount to the
Buyer. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the working capital adjustment
provided for in this _Section 1.4_, and the dispute resolution provisions
provided for in this _Section 1.4_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
for the matters addressed herein. For the avoidance of doubt, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing or the ability of the Buyer to seek
indemnity for a breach of this _Section 1.4_, no claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Article X_ may be asserted by the Buyer solely for the payment
of a Working Capital Shortfall that is the subject of this _Section 1.4_.

(d) _Payment by the Buyer_. If the Final Closing Working Capital is greater
than the Estimated Closing Working Capital, then the Buyer shall, within three
(3) Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing Working Capital
in accordance with  _Section 1.4(b)_, pay an amount of cash in the aggregate
equal to (i) the Final Closing Working Capital, _less_ (ii) the Estimated
Closing Working Capital, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to
the Sellers Representative (for further delivery to the Sellers in
accordance with their respective Fractions).

(e)  _Adjustment Payments_. Any payment pursuant to _Section 1.4(c)_ or
_Section 1.4(d)_ shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 1.5 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to _Article XI_ , and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of
the conditions set forth in _Articles VIII_ and _IX_ , the closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, 610 Newport Center Drive, 17th Floor,
Newport Beach, California, or such other place (including by electronic
transmission) as the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall agree, at
12:01 a.m. Pacific Time on the first Business Day of the first month in 2010
following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set forth in _Articles
VIII_ and _IX_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), or at such other date, time or place as the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer shall agree in writing; _provided_ , that (i) at
any time from and after the first day Business Day following the satisfaction
or waiver of all conditions set forth in  _Article VIII_ (other than those
conditions set forth in _Sections 8.3_ , _8.1_ and _8.2_ (solely with respect
to delivery of the certificates referenced therein), _8.11(a)_ (solely with
respect to consummation of the transfers contemplated by the Heald Education
Transfer Agreement as described therein), _8.14_ , _8.17_ and, if applicable,
_8.10_ , that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, in each
case, which would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur within two
Business Days of such Business Day), the Company may deliver written notice
certified by an authorized officer of the Company to the Buyer that all such
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied (or with respect
to those conditions set forth in _Sections 8.3_ , _8.1_ and _8.2_ (solely
with 



 

\- 20 -  respect to delivery of the certificates referenced therein), _8.11(a)_
(solely with respect to consummation of the transfers contemplated by the
Heald Education Transfer Agreement as described therein), _8.14_ , _8.17_
and, if applicable, _8.10_ , that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, would each be satisfied if the Closing were to occur within two
Business Days of such delivery) (the date of such written notice, the "
_Deferral Date_ "), and (ii) as long as all such conditions were actually
satisfied or waived as of the Deferral Date, effective as of the Deferral
Date, Buyer hereby irrevocably waives all conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ (other than the condition set forth in _Sections 8.3_ , _8.1_ and _8.2_
(solely with respect to delivery of the certificates referenced therein),
_8.11(a)_ (solely with respect to consummation of the transfers contemplated
by the Heald Education Transfer Agreement as described therein), _8.14_ ,
_8.17_ and, if applicable, _8.10_ , that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, in each case, which would be satisfied if the Closing were to
occur within two Business Days of such Business Day) from and after such date
(and thereafter all such conditions shall be deemed satisfied for all purposes
under this Agreement, such that the Buyer shall be obligated to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to take place at
the Closing under this Agreement even if one or more of such conditions are no
longer satisfied on the Closing Date so long as all such conditions were
satisfied as of the Deferral Date). The date on which the Closing occurs is
herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.6  _Payment of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be
distributed as follows, in each case as reflected on the Consideration
Spreadsheet:

(a) _Estimated Payment_. At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with, and to the
accounts designated by the Company on behalf of the Sellers in, the
Consideration Spreadsheet an aggregate amount in cash equal to the result of:
(i) Three Hundred Ninety-Five Million Dollars ($395,000,000), _minus_ (ii) the
sum of the Closing Payments and Assumed Obligations,  _plus_ (iii) the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment (which for the avoidance of doubt
may be a positive or negative amount), _minus_ (iv) the Escrow Amount, _minus_
(v) the Purchased Subsidiary Membership Interests Purchase Price, _minus_

(b) _Purchased Subsidiary Membership Interests Purchase Price_. At the
Closing, the Buyer (on behalf of the Company) shall pay to the holders of the
Purchased Subsidiary Membership Interests (pursuant to the terms of the Heald

and to the accounts and in the amounts designated by the Company on behalf of
the holders of the Purchased Subsidiary Membership Interests in, the
Consideration Spreadsheet, an aggregate amount in cash equal to the
Purchased Subsidiary Membership Interests Purchase Price in satisfaction of
the Companys obligations under the Heald Education Transfer Agreement.

(c) _Installment Payment Retention Amount_. At the Closing, the Buyer (on
behalf of the Company) shall retain a portion of the Purchase Price in an
aggregate amount equal to the Installment Payment Retention Amount. Such
amount shall be held by the Buyer for payment to those holders of Purchased
Subsidiary Membership Interests who have entered 



 

\- 21 -  into Installment Payment Retention Agreements in accordance with the terms
of the Installment Payment Retention Agreements. In the event that any such
holder fails to satisfy any of the conditions required of such individual
under the terms of his or her Installment Payment Retention Agreement such
that he or she forfeits his or her rights to a portion of the Installment
Payment Retention Amount, such portion of the Installment Payment Retention
Amount shall promptly be paid by the Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to the Sellers Representative (for further delivery to the
Sellers in accordance with their respective Fractions). In the event of
a Buyer Change of Control or a sale of the Company and its Subsidiaries by
the Buyer to a third party, the Buyer will cause all remaining Installment
Payment Retention Amounts to be placed in a third-party escrow account
pursuant to an agreement to which the Sellers Representative is party for

the Sellers) in accordance with the terms of the Profits Units Settlement

(d) _Employee Payments_. At the Closing, the Company or a Subsidiary shall
make all Employee Payments (other than the aggregate amount of Subsequent

Price in an aggregate amount equal to the Subsequent Payment Retention Amount.
Such amount shall be held by the Buyer for payment to those individuals who
have entered into Profits Units Settlement Agreements in accordance with the
terms of the Profits Units Settlement Agreements. In the event that any such
individual fails to satisfy any of the conditions required of such individual
under the terms of his or her Installment Payment Retention Agreement such
that he or she forfeits his or her rights to a portion of the Subsequent
Payment Retention Amount, such portion of the Subsequent Payment Retention
Amount shall promptly be paid by the Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately

Sellers in accordance with their respective Fractions).

(e) _Transaction Expenses_. At the Closing, the Buyer (on behalf of the
Company and the Subsidiaries) shall pay all Transaction Expenses.

Escrow Agreement. The portion of the Escrow Amount allocable to each Seller
(and deducted from each Sellers share of the Purchase Price otherwise payable

shall be determined by multiplying the Escrow Amount by such Sellers
Fraction. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand (as a
Transaction Expense), shall share equally all fees of the Escrow Agent in
connection with the Escrow Agreement and the administration of the Escrow
Fund, as provided in the Escrow Agreement.



 

\- 22 - (h) _Sellers  Representative Expense Amount_. At the Closing, the Buyer
shall deposit in an account of and designated by the Sellers Representative
an amount in cash equal to the Sellers Representative Expense Amount to be
held in a separate deposit account of the Sellers Representative (the "
_Sellers  Representative Expense Fund_") and used by the Sellers
Representative for the payment of fees, costs and expenses incurred by the
Sellers Representative in the performance of the Sellers Representatives
duties pursuant to the terms of _Section 12.14_. The Sellers Representative
shall keep reasonably detailed records of the costs and expenses paid by the
Sellers Representative from the Sellers Representative Expense Fund and
shall provide access to such records to any Seller upon written request of the
holders of a majority interest of the Fractions. The Sellers Representative
shall release to the Sellers in accordance with their respective Fractions
all remaining funds then held in the Sellers Representative Expense Fund at
any time that it determines. Following the release of such funds, the Sellers
Representative shall provide, upon written request of the holders of a
majority interest of the Fractions, a final accounting of all fees, costs,
expenses and other amounts paid by the Sellers Representative from the

hereto sets forth the name of each Seller, the amount of cash such Seller is
entitled to receive at the Closing pursuant to this _Section 1.6_, the
Purchased Subsidiary Membership Interests Purchase Price (and the methodology
of determining such amount) and the portion thereof each holder of vested
Purchased Subsidiary Membership Interests is entitled to receive at the
Closing pursuant to this _Section 1.6_, the Installment Payment Retention
Amount (and the methodology of determining such amount) and the portion
thereof each holder of unvested Purchased Subsidiary Membership Interests is
entitled to receive under their respective Installment Payment Retention
Agreement (subject to forfeiture in accordance with the terms thereof), each

amounts of any Closing Payments and Assumed Obligations as of the date hereof.

Spreadsheet setting forth the final calculations of the amounts due at the
Closing to each Seller pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ and the Purchased
Subsidiary Membership Interests Purchase Price and Installment Payment
Retention Amount and the recipients thereof pursuant to the Heald Education
Transfer Agreement and the Installment Payment Retention Agreement, and (ii)
the recipients and amounts of any Closing Payments and Assumed Obligations to
be paid by the Buyer. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that
the Consideration Spreadsheet attached hereto sets forth the methodology for
allocating the Purchase Price but contains only estimates of the amounts
actually payable at Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the portion of the
Purchase Price that will be payable to the Sellers of the Holding Companies
will be the portion of the Purchase Price otherwise allocable to the Non-
Purchased Company Membership Interests; _provided_ , that (A) the Estimated SP
Holdings CODI Liability shall reduce the portion of the Purchase Price
payable to the Seller of 



 

\- 23 -  the Stock of SP Holdings (and not any portion of the Purchase Price payable
to any other Seller), and (B) the Estimated SD Holdings CODI Liability shall
reduce the portion of the Purchase Price payable to the Seller of the Stock

Seller).

entitled to deduct and withhold from the payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payments under the Code or any other applicable provision of
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld pursuant to this _Section
1.7_, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 1.8 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall allocate the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to
and paid for the Purchased Company Membership Interests for Tax purposes among
the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries in accordance with the
allocation principles set forth on _Schedule 1.8_, including determining the
portion of the gain or loss recognized by each holder of Purchased Company
Membership Interests upon the sale of such holders Purchased Company
Membership Interests pursuant to this Agreement that is attributable to
the Companys and the Subsidiaries "unrealized receivables" and "inventory
items" (as such terms are defined in Section 751 of the Code). Neither the
Buyer nor the Sellers, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall take any
position on any Tax Return (including IRS Form 8594), before any Governmental
Entity or in any judicial proceeding which is inconsistent with such
allocation of the Purchase Price unless required to do so by applicable Law.

case of the Company, are not true and correct in all material respects.

(b) Any disclosure set forth on a Schedule shall also constitute a disclosure
for purposes of, or an exception to, as applicable, any other representation
or warranty in this Agreement if (i) the substance of such disclosure is
disclosed on such other applicable Schedule, (ii) a specific cross-reference
to another Schedule or to another representation or warranty is made, or
(iii) the applicability of such disclosure to another Schedule or to another
representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on its face. Without
limiting any rights or obligations under this Agreement, the inclusion of
information in a Schedule shall not be construed as or constitute an admission
or agreement that a violation, right of termination, default, liability or

of any of the provisions of _Article VI_. Any such supplements, modifications
and updates shall not be taken into account in determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ , _8.2_ and _8.3_ are satisfied, but in

or update and no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification
with respect thereto, in each case solely to the extent such information

any representation or warranty with respect to the information disclosed in
any such supplement, modification or update and no Seller Indemnitee shall be
entitled to any indemnification with respect thereto, in each case solely to

\- 64 -  " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall be provided, for a period extending until
the earlier of the termination of such Continuing Employees employment with
such entities or the first anniversary of the Closing Date, with benefits
that are at least as favorable as benefits (i) that are on substantially the
same terms as provided to similarly situated employees of the Buyer or (ii)
that are on substantially the same terms as provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to Closing, whichever is less. Nothing in this
Agreement (x) shall require the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to continue
to employ any particular employee following the Closing Date, or (y) shall be
construed to prohibit the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any Benefit Plan.

(b) The Buyer shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Continuing
Employee receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to
participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but
excluding benefit accrual) for service with the Company and the Subsidiaries
(and their respective predecessors) under each of the comparable employee
benefit plans, programs and policies of the Buyer or its relevant subsidiary,
as applicable, in which such Continuing Employee becomes a participant;
provided, however, that no such service recognition shall result in any
duplication of benefits. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan
maintained by the Buyer, or its relevant subsidiary for the benefit of any
Continuing Employees, subject only to any required approval of the applicable
insurance provider, if any, the Buyer shall (i) cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and
the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan, and
(ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all
amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Benefit Plan for
the plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable plan
maintained by Buyer, or its relevant subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs.

(c) Prior to Closing, the Companys Managing Member shall adopt a resolution
or consent to terminate each 401(k) Plan sponsored or maintained by the
Company, effective as of no later than one day prior to Closing (but such
termination may be contingent upon the Closing). For this purpose, the term "
_401(k) Plan_ " means any plan intended to be qualified under Code Section
401(a) which includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under
Code Section 401(k). The Company shall provide the Buyer with a copy of
resolutions duly adopted by the Companys board of directors (or equivalent)
so terminating any such 401(k) Plan. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
make all required contributions to the 401(k) Plan or cause for such
contributions to be accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet, so that the
contributions, or accrual, as applicable, will be sufficient to: (i) cover
elective deferrals made pursuant to the 401(k) Plan prior to the Closing, and
(ii) cover employer matching contributions (on a fully vested basis) for the
period prior to termination.

(d) As a condition to the payment of the applicable portion of the Employee
Payments (other than pursuant to a Profits Units Settlement Agreement) to each
employee to whom such payment shall be made at the Closing, the Company shall
have received from each such employee an executed general release that has
become non-revocable in accordance with its terms, substantially in the
customary separation agreement form used by the Company 



 

\- 65 -  (it being understood that the applicable recipient of an Employee Payment
may decline the Employee Payment and not sign a release).

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) amend, or be deemed to
amend, any Benefit Plan, (ii) provide any person not a party to this
Agreement with any right, benefit or remedy with regard to any Benefit Plan or
a right to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or (iii) limit in any way
the Buyers ability to amend or terminate any Benefit Plan at any time.

(f) The Buyer shall be solely responsible for complying with the requirements
of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code for

contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) Each of the Sellers shall, individually and ratably based on such Sellers
Fraction (and not jointly and severally), indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnitees from and against such Sellers Fraction of any Liability
with respect to any employees of the Sellers arising under the WARN Act solely
as a result of the Sellers actions or omissions occurring prior to the
Closing. Provided that the Company or the Sellers Representative provides the
Buyer with a true and accurate list, by date and location, of employee layoffs
implemented by the Company or its Affiliates in the ninety (90) days
preceding the Closing, the Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees from and against any Liability with respect to any employees after

actions or omissions occurring on and after the Closing Date.

assessments in connection with Taxes of the Holding Companies, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (or an issue relating thereto); provided that the
Buyer shall only have the obligation to notify the Sellers Representative if
the Proceeding or assessment would, if determined adversely to the taxpayer,
or after the lapse of time, be grounds for indemnification under  _Article X_

connection with any Proceeding or assessment involving any issue that could
reasonably be expected to result in the Sellers bearing any liability or
incurring any obligation under this Agreement, including, without limitation,

without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, the Buyer shall

the Buyer shall cooperate with the Sellers Representative in filing such Tax
Returns, including causing the Company and its Subsidiaries to sign and file

in a manner consistent with Sellers past practice unless otherwise required
by Law.

Return or claim for refund that the Sellers Representative reasonably
requests to be filed with respect to the Company or the Subsidiaries for any
taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date, provided, however,
that Buyer shall not be required to file any amended Tax Return or claim for
refund that includes the carrying back of any net operating loss or tax credit
economically generated to any taxable year or period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) the retention and the provision of
records and information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding, and the provision of powers of attorney, provided, however,

years with the consent of the other party (and if such other party does not
consent, such other party shall pay the costs of delivering such records to
such other party and the costs of further retention) and (iii) the Sellers
providing, or causing to be provided, no later than 15 days prior to the due
date of the U.S. federal income Tax Return of the Company for the stub period

US law) with respect to the acquisition of the Holding Companies.

(g) _Certain Tax Matters_. 

(i) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated
by this agreement shall result in a termination of the Companies and each of
its Subsidiaries that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes at the time of the Closing within the meaning Section 708 of the
Code, and that the U.S. federal income tax year of the Company and each such
Subsidiary (and, where applicable, state, local, and non-U.S. tax years) will
close on the Closing Date as a result of such termination; and (ii) the
Holding Companies shall become members of the Buyers U.S. federal income Tax
consolidated return at the end of the Closing Date, and that the U.S. federal
income tax year of the Holding Companies (and, where applicable, state, local,

the Purchased Company Membership Interests pursuant to this Agreement shall
constitute an acceleration event within the meaning of Code Section
108(i)(5)(D)(ii), and (iii) the sale of the Stock pursuant to this Agreement

with this _Section 7.5(g)_.

(h) _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof

with respect to the Holding Companies, the Company, and its Subsidiaries, and
any amounts that would have been received as a Tax refund by or with respect
to the Holding Companies, the Company and its Subsidiaries, but for Buyers
affirmative choice to have such amount credited against Tax for the Holding
Companies, the Company, and its Subsidiaries, for a taxable year or period (or
portion thereof) that begins after the Closing Date, that relate to any
taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period deemed to
end on and include the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Sellers,
and Buyer shall pay to the Sellers any such Tax refund or the amount of any
such credit (which, for 



 

\- 69 -  the avoidance of doubt, shall equal the actual reduction in the amount of
Taxes otherwise payable by the Holding Companies, the Company, and its
Subsidiaries solely as a result of such credit) within fifteen (15) days
after receipt or entitlement thereto.

(i) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Pre-Closing Holding Company Taxes shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for
such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through
entity in which the Holding Companies hold a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time); provided, however, that with respect to
Taxes (other than income, franchise/capital sales, use, or withholding Taxes)
or exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis, and not on a closing of the books method, (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) such Taxes, exemptions, allowances, or deductions
shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the Closing
Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date based on the number of
days for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date, on the one hand, and the number of days for the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, on the other hand.

provide the Buyer with an exhibit showing in reasonable detail the
calculation of the Final SP Holdings CODI Liability and the Final SD Holdings
CODI Liability (the " _Final CODI Exhibit_ ") for the Buyers review and
approval. In connection with the Buyers review of the Final CODI Exhibit,
the Sellers Representative shall promptly provide any supporting or related
documentation reasonably requested by the Buyer. If the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative are unable to resolve any dispute regarding the Final SP
Holdings CODI Liability and the Final SD Holdings CODI Liability within
fifteen (15) Business Days following the Buyers receipt of the Final CODI
Exhibit, such dispute shall be resolved promptly by a reputable independent
accounting firm of nationally recognized standing (other than one of the "big
four") reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers Representative and the Buyer,
the costs of which shall be borne equally by the Sellers Representative and
the Buyer (it being understood and agreed that any such costs shall be borne
entirely by Summit Partners Private Equity Fund VII-B, L.P. (if such dispute
concerns the Final SP Holdings CODI Liability) and entirely by Summit
Subordinated Debt Fund III-B, L.P. (if such dispute concerns the Final SD
Holdings CODI Liability) and in no case by any other Seller).

(ii) If the Estimated SP Holdings CODI Liability is greater than the Final SP
Holdings CODI Liability (as finally determined pursuant to _Section
7.5(j)(i)_), then the Buyer shall, within three (3) Business Days after the
determination of the Final SP Holdings CODI Liability in accordance with
_Section 7.5(j)(i)_, pay an amount of cash in the aggregate equal to (i) the
Estimated SP Holdings CODI Liability _less_  (ii) the Final SP Holdings CODI
Liability, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the account
designated by Summit Partners Private Equity Fund VII-B, L.P. in the
Sellers 



 

\- 70 -  Representatives notice to the Buyer accompanying the exhibit under _Section
7.5(j)(i)_. If the Final SP Holdings CODI Liability is greater than the
Estimated SP Holdings CODI Liability, then Summit Partners Private Equity
Fund VII-B, L.P. shall, within three (3) Business Days after the determination
of the Final SP Holdings CODI Liability in accordance with _Section
7.5(j)(i)_, pay an amount of cash in the aggregate equal to (i) the Final SP
Holdings CODI Liability _less_ (ii) the Estimated SP Holdings CODI Liability,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account designated by
the Buyer prior thereto.

(iii) If the Estimated SD Holdings CODI Liability is greater than the Final SD
Holdings CODI Liability (as finally determined pursuant to _Section
7.5(j)(i)_), then the Buyer shall, within three (3) Business Days after the
determination of the Final SD Holdings CODI Liability in accordance with
_Section 7.5(j)(i)_, pay an amount of cash in the aggregate equal to (i) the
Estimated SD Holdings CODI Liability _less_ (ii) the Final SD Holdings CODI
Liability, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the account
designated by Summit Subordinated Debt Fund III-B, L.P. in the Sellers
Representatives notice to the Buyer under _Section 7.5(j)(i)_. If the Final
SD Holdings CODI Liability is greater than the Estimated SD Holdings CODI
Liability, then Summit Subordinated Debt Fund III-B, L.P. shall, within three
(3) Business Days after the determination of the Final SD Holdings CODI
Liability in accordance with _Section 7.5(j)(i)_, pay an amount of cash in
the aggregate equal to (i) the Final SD Holdings CODI Liability _less_ (ii)
the Estimated SD Holdings CODI Liability, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to an account designated by the Buyer prior thereto.

(iv) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the adjustment mechanism provided
for in this _Section 7.5(j)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to U.S. federal income Taxes imposed on Holding Companies with respect
to the COD Income. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing or the ability of the Buyer to seek indemnity for
a breach of this _Section 7.5(j)_, no claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Article X_ may be asserted by the Buyer solely for the payment of U.S.
federal income Taxes imposed on the Holding Companies in respect of the COD
Income.

Section 7.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Responsibility for all stock transfer Taxes,
sales Taxes, documentary stamp Taxes, recording charges and other similar
Taxes, charges, fees or other amounts arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall
be borne equally fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by the

Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared by the party primarily or customarily responsible under applicable
local Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party will provide such Tax
Returns to the other party for such other partys review and approval at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be

Section 7.12 _2009 Financial Aid Audits; Percentage of Title IV Revenues_.

(a) In connection with the preparation of the financial aid compliance audits
for the Company Schools for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009, at

audit to ED, the Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative with
reasonable advance notice of any identified deficiencies that are expected to

of any Company School and allow the Sellers Representative a reasonable
opportunity to communicate its views to the Buyer on the resolution of such
deficiencies during 



 

\- 74 -  the 14-day period beginning upon the Buyers delivery of such notice;
provided that the Buyer shall control the preparation, filing and resolution
of all such compliance audits.

 

(b) The Company shall, at the Buyers expense, permit representatives of
Weworski and Associates reasonable access to the Companys accounting and
control systems used to collect and process the information necessary to
generate a report determining (for any specified period) the percentage of
revenues of each Company School that are derived from Title IV Programs, with
such percentage calculated (a) using the methodology set forth in 34 C.F.R. §
600.5, as applied in a manner that is consistent with the Companys and the
Subsidiaries past practice with respect to such calculations, and (b) as
applicable, in a manner consistent with Section 493 of the Higher Education
Opportunity Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-315) (the " _HEOA_ ") and any final
regulations adopted by ED pursuant to Section 493 of the HEOA on or before
November 1, 2009, provided that such final regulations conform in all material
respects to the proposed regulations as published by ED on August 21, 2009
(such report, a " _90-10 Report_ " and such accounting and control systems,

it to obtain reasonable satisfaction that the Companys 90-10 Reporting
Systems are able to generate an accurate 90-10 Report for each Company School

Associates to conduct such testing in a reasonable manner so that (i) all
such testing shall be completed by November 30, 2009, (ii) the Company shall
not be required to produce more source information for Weworski and Associates
than that reasonably necessary to make a statistically reliable determination
that the Companys 90-10 Reporting Systems are able to generate an accurate
90-10 Report for each Company School for the fiscal year ending December 31,
2009, and (iii) the results of the testing by Weworski and Associates shall be
shared at the same time with both the Company and the Buyer.

Affiliates, officers, directors, partners, employees, members, managers,

irrevocably releases and discharges the Holding Companies, the Company, the
Subsidiaries, and the employees, officers, directors, managers and managing

Rights. Each Seller Releasor represents and warrants that he, she, or it
has

the fullest extent permitted by legal requirements, the provisions, rights
and benefits of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which provides as

or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which
if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

 

(d) Each of the Seller Releasors expressly warrants that he, she, or it has
been advised by his or its legal counsel, and understands and acknowledges
the significance and consequence of this release, of this specific waiver of

a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.10_ ,

basis exceed an amount equal to such Sellers Fraction of 20% of the excess
of the Purchase Price (as determined pursuant to _Article I_ without reduction
for indemnification claims), over the sum of the Closing Payments and Assumed
Obligations (inclusive, for the avoidance of doubt, of such Sellers Fraction
of the Escrow Fund and amounts paid in satisfaction of other claims).

to be performed by any Holding Company after the Closing) under
this Agreement and no Seller shall be liable for greater than its Fraction of
the amount of any Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee arising out of a
breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements (in the case of covenants or agreements, excluding those to be
performed by the Company after the Closing) under this Agreement.

warranties constituting Excluded Claims shall not in the aggregate on a
cumulative basis exceed $395,000,000 (inclusive, for the avoidance of doubt,
of amounts paid in satisfaction of other claims), (B) claims for
indemnification based on a breach of the covenants and agreements set forth in
_Article I_ shall not in the aggregate on a cumulative basis
exceed $395,000,000 (inclusive, for the avoidance of doubt, of amounts paid
in satisfaction of other claims), (C) claims for indemnification based on a
breach of the covenants and agreements constituting Excluded Claims (other
than the covenants and agreements set forth in _Article I_ and other than the
covenants and agreements set forth in _Section 10.2(a)(iv)_), and (D) claims
for indemnification based on a breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in  _Section 5.9_ shall not in the aggregate on a cumulative basis

(inclusive, for the avoidance of doubt, of amounts paid in satisfaction of
other claims).

Section 10.4 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

(a) In the event that a party entitled to indemnification pursuant to the
terms hereof (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") proposes to make any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ , such Indemnified Party shall
deliver a written demand (a " _Claim Certificate_ ") to the Sellers
Representative (in the case of an indemnification claim from a Buyer
Indemnitee) or to the Buyer (in the case of an indemnification claim from a
Seller Indemnitee) which Claim Certificate shall contain (A) a description
of and if reasonably determinable at the time such 



 

\- 85 -  demand is delivered, the amount of any Losses incurred or reasonably
expected to be incurred by such Indemnified Party, (B) a statement that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this _Article X_ and a
reasonable explanation of the basis therefor and (C) a demand for
indemnification hereunder and payment of all such Losses.

(b) In case the potential Indemnifying Party does not, within thirty (30) days
of the receipt thereof, object to any claim or claims made in any Claim
Certificate pursuant to the terms hereof, the Buyer shall deliver to the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of and for distribution to the Sellers) or
the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall promptly instruct the Escrow
Agent to release to the Buyer (or the applicable Seller(s) shall deliver to
the Buyer), as applicable, an amount equal to the Losses set forth in the
Claim Certificate arising out of any claim or claims which are not objected to
by the Indemnifying Party.

(c) In case the potential Indemnifying Party shall object in writing to any
claim or claims made in any Claim Certificate, the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Buyer and the
Sellers Representative should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and the Buyer shall
deliver to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of and for distribution to
the Sellers) or the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to release to the Buyer (or the applicable Seller(s) shall
deliver to the Buyer), as applicable, the amount set forth in such memorandum
in accordance with the terms thereof. In the event that parties are not able
to reach an agreement, or the memorandum contains an agreement as to only a
portion of the Losses in question, the parties may resolve such dispute in the
manner provided in _Section 12.9_ hereof.

Section 10.5 _Additional Indemnity Provisions_. The indemnification
obligations of the Buyer and the Sellers hereunder shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions:

(a) The right of the parties after the Closing to assert
indemnification claims and receive indemnification payments pursuant to this
_Article X_ and pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be the sole and
exclusive right and remedy exercisable by the parties with respect to any
inaccuracy or breach in any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby except
for actions seeking specific performance or similar non-monetary equitable
relief and in the case of actual common law fraud or willful and knowing
breaches of any representation or warranty. In furtherance of the foregoing
but without limiting their rights to indemnification under this  _Article X_
or any other rights hereunder, each Indemnified Party hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against
any Indemnifying Party or any Seller Indemnitee relating to the operation of
the Company or its business or relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether arising under or
based upon any Law or otherwise (including any right, whether arising at law
or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages,
or any other recourse or remedy, including as may arise under common law).



 

\- 86 - (b) The term " _Loss_ " or " _Losses_ " shall mean any and all actions,
assessments, claims, deficiencies, diminution in value, disbursements,
proceedings, settlements, suit of any kind or nature, liabilities, judgments,
penalties, fines, losses, Taxes, damages (other than punitive or exemplary
damages, except to the extent any such damages are paid to a third party) and
out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys fees and accounting fees and related disbursements.

(c) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
calculated net of (i) any cash amounts actually recovered by an Indemnified
Party or any of such Indemnified Partys Affiliates under or pursuant to any
insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement
or contract pursuant to which or under which such Indemnified Party or such
Indemnified Partys Affiliates is a party or has rights, and (ii) any Tax
Benefit that an Indemnified Party actually recognizes in the year of the
indemnity payment or earlier on account of such Loss, net of any Tax costs
related to such indemnity payment or Loss. An Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to actually recognize a Tax Benefit with respect to a taxable year if,
and to the extent that, the Indemnified Partys liability for Taxes for such
taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributed to the Losses,
exceeds the Indemnified Partys actual liability for Taxes for such taxable
year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items attributed to the
Losses. With respect to any particular matter, no party shall be entitled to
any indemnification under this _Article X_ for a Loss to the extent (and only
to the extent) that such Loss was included in the calculation of the working
capital adjustment or was an unresolved disputed item resolved by the
Accounting Arbitrator.

(d) Any payments made as indemnification under _Sections 10.2_ or _10.3_
, and any payments made under _Section 7.5(j)_, shall be considered
adjustments to the Purchase Price for United States federal, state and local
income Tax purposes to the extent permitted under applicable Law.

(e) The rights to indemnification set forth in this Agreement based on the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and obligations set forth
herein shall not be affected by any investigation conducted by the Buyer with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. An Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
10.2_ or _Section 10.3_ with respect to any claim unless the amount
of Losses with respect to any individual claim (or a series of related
claims) thereunder exceeds $75,000 (the " _Minimum Claims Threshold_ ") and
such Losses shall not be included for purposes of determining whether the
applicable Indemnification Basket has been met; provided, however, that in
the event such Losses with respect to any claim (or series of related claims)
exceed the Minimum Claims Threshold, all such Losses with respect to such
claim (or series of related claims), including the amounts below the Minimum
Claims Threshold, shall be included for purposes of determining whether the
applicable Indemnification Basket has been met; provided, further, however,
that the Minimum Claims Threshold shall not apply to any Losses for which the
Indemnification Basket would not apply (other than any Losses arising out of,
in connection with, or otherwise incurred by virtue of or with respect to a
breach of _Article VI_ to the extent that the Company had no prior Knowledge
of the action constituting such breach).



 

\- 87 - (f) Nothing in this _Article X_ shall be deemed to override any obligations
with respect to mitigation of damages existing under applicable Law.

(g) After any indemnification payment is made to any Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Article X_ , the Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of
such payment, be subrogated to all rights (if any) of the Indemnified Party
against any third parties in connection with the Losses to which such payment
relates. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any
Indemnified Party receiving an indemnification payment pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall execute, upon the written request of the Indemnifying
Party, any instrument reasonably necessary to evidence such subrogation
rights provided that such instrument is limited to the evidencing of such
rights.

(h) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not have any right to indemnification
hereunder for any Losses arising out of the breach of any of the
representations and warranties in _Section 4.11_ or  _Section 4.15_ to the
extent that the facts underlying such Losses are discovered solely as the
result of sampling or testing of any soil, groundwater or other media or
material that is undertaken by Buyer without a legitimate business purpose.
For these purposes, "legitimate business purpose" shall include, but not be
limited to (1) compliance with applicable Laws, including any Environmental
Laws; (2) compliance third party requests; (3) responding to or in
contemplation of concerns, questions or issues arising from the operation and
maintenance of the facility, improvements planned or executed at the facility,
demolition or proposed demolition of any portion of the facility, sale,
financing or mortgaging of the property or any portion thereof; or (4)
responding to or in contemplation of any other activity that reasonably
requires the investigation of soil, groundwater or other media or material;
but a "legitimate business purpose" shall not include solely ascertaining
whether indemnifiable Losses exist.

(i) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not have any right to indemnification under
_Section 10.2(c)(iii)_ or under the representations and warranties under
_Sections 3.10_ , _4.12_ or _4.13(i)_ to the extent the Taxes or Losses result
from (i) actions taken by the Buyer, the Holding Companies, the Company, or
any of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date but after the Closing if such
action is not the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
unless such action is contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) actions or
positions taken by the Buyer, the Holding Companies, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date in reliance on representations and
warranties under _Sections 3.10_ , _4.12_ or  _4.13(i)_ continuing to be true
after the Closing Date.

(j) Reference is made to that certain Building Lease, dated as of August 14,
2009, by and between Innovative Technology Business Park, LLC and Heald
College, LLC, as amended by an undated Letter Agreement (in the form made
available to the Buyer the " _Salida Lease_ "). The terms of the Salida Lease
provide for a tenant allowance from the landlord under the Salida Lease in the
amount of approximately $1,800,000 or for the offset of such allowance against
rent due under the Salida Lease. In the event that the Buyer seeks, but is not
able to obtain within 30 days of its request, written confirmation from the
landlord under the Salida Lease (or any assignee or lender thereto) that such
landlord (or assignee or lender thereto, as applicable) will honor the terms
of such allowance or offset, then, if Buyer notifies the landlord under the
Salida Lease in writing that Heald College, LLC is terminating the Salida
Lease as a 



 

\- 88 -  result of the failure of the landlord (or any assignee or lender thereto) to
honor the terms of such allowance or offset, the Buyer shall be deemed to have
suffered a Loss in the lesser of the following amounts: (a) the unreimbursed
amount of tenant improvements made by the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries
(including the Company or any of the Subsidiaries following the Closing) to
the property that is the subject of the Salida Lease (up to $1,800,000
actually paid and not reimbursed or offset) or (b) costs associated with such
termination; provided, however, that if the Buyer seeks to terminate the
Salida Lease as described in this _Section 10.5(j)_, but is not successful
in doing so, then the amount of the Buyers Loss under this _Section 10.5(j)_
shall be deemed to be the amount specified in _clause (a)_ of this _Section
10.5(j)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
10.5(j)_, the Buyer shall not be entitled to seek reimbursement from the
Sellers for tenant improvements made by the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries
(including the Company or any of the Subsidiaries following the Closing) to
the property that is the subject of the Salida Lease, unless, prior to
incurring such expenditures, the Buyer has sought to terminate the Salida
Lease as described in this _Section 10.5(j)_, but has been unsuccessful in
doing so.

Section 10.6 _Defense of Third-Party Claims and Extension of Statute of
Limitations_.

(a) A party seeking indemnity hereunder shall provide the Sellers
Representative (if indemnity is sought from the Sellers including out of the
Escrow Fund) or the Buyer (if indemnity is sought from the Buyer) (the party
from whom indemnity is sought, an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with prompt notice
of any claim, suit, action or proceeding (including appeals) in respect of
such item (or items) by any Person (but excluding any matter described in
_Section 7.5(a)_) other than the Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_
"); _provided_ that the failure to provide such notice to the Indemnifying
Party shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this _Article X_ except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right in its discretion and at its expense to participate in
and control the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim, provided that
the Indemnifying Party may control the defense or settlement of such Third-
Party Claim only if (i) the subject matter of such Third Party claim does not
involve an attempt by the claimant to restrain or enjoin the Company or the
Subsidiaries from engaging in their respective ongoing businesses (as opposed
to the payment of money damages), (ii) does not involve criminal allegations,
(iii) the Indemnifying Party admits that such Third Party Claim is
indemnifiable pursuant to this _Article X_ and that the Indemnifying Parties
will pay any Losses arising therefrom (subject to the limitations in this
_Article X_ (including, without limitation, the Indemnification Basket and the
limitations in _Section 10.2(f)_)), and (iv) such Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of such Third-Party Claim within thirty (30) days of receipt by
the Indemnifying Party of notice of such Third-Party Claim and a reasonable
description of such Third-Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (I) the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof (except as provided in  _Section 10.6(b)_ below) and (II)
the Indemnified Party will provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable
assistance with respect to such Third-Party Claim; provided that the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for all of
its out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in
connection with such assistance.



 

\- 89 - (b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in
the defense of such Third-Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its
choice for such purpose; provided, that such employment shall be at the
Indemnified Partys own expense unless any of the following are true, in
which case the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for
any such expense: (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized
by the Indemnifying Party in writing, or (ii) there is a conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to the
defense of the Third-Party Claim that would make it inappropriate, as
reasonably advised by counsel to the Indemnified Party, for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party.

(c) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, neither the Indemnifying Party nor any of its Affiliates
nor the Indemnified Party nor any of the other Seller Indemnitees or Buyer
Indemnitees, as the case may be, shall admit any liability with respect to,
consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge, any
Third Party Claim for which indemnity is sought without the prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of the other
such party;  _provided_ that if the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party may consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the consent of
the Indemnified Party if (x) such judgment or settlement includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each
named Indemnified Party of a complete and unconditional release from all
liability in respect to such claim, (y) such judgment or settlement would not
result in the finding or admission of any violation of Law, and (z) such
consent or settlement is for monetary damages fully indemnified by the
Indemnified Party hereunder and includes no injunctive or other equitable
relief that would be imposed against the Indemnified Party. The Sellers
Representative shall act on behalf of all Sellers as Indemnifying Parties in
the case of all claims with respect to which a Buyer Indemnitee is seeking
indemnification from the Sellers under this _Article X_.

Interests to the Buyer in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, and to act on behalf of the Sellers in any litigation or
arbitration or other action or proceeding under this Agreement or arising out
of the transactions contemplated hereby, do or refrain from doing all such
further acts and things, and execute all such documents as the Sellers
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the power:

(i) to act for the Sellers with regard to matters pertaining to
indemnification referred to in this Agreement, including the power to
compromise any indemnity claim on behalf of the Sellers and to transact
matters of litigation;

(ii) to execute and deliver all ancillary agreements, certificates and
documents that the Sellers Representative deems necessary or appropriate in
connection with the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement;

(iii) to enter into (pursuant to _Section 12.1_) one or more amendments to
this Agreement or to waive (pursuant to _Section 12.2_) the failure of the
Buyer to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition contained herein;

(iv) to receive funds and give receipts for funds, including in respect of any
adjustments to the Purchase Price;

(v) to enter into the Escrow Agreement and take all actions contemplated to be
taken by the Sellers Representative thereunder;

(vi) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the
Sellers that the Sellers Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its
sole 



 

\- 95 -  discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully and
completely as the Sellers could do if personally present; and

(vii) to receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

(b) The appointment of the Sellers Representative shall be deemed coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and the Buyer and any other Person
may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the
Sellers Representative in all matters referred to herein. All notices
required to be made or delivered by the Buyer to any of the Sellers shall
be made to the Sellers Representative for the benefit of such Seller and
shall discharge in full all notice requirements of the Buyer to the Sellers
with respect thereto. The Sellers hereby confirm all that the Sellers
Representative shall do or cause to be done by virtue of its appointment as
the Sellers Representative. The Sellers Representative shall act for the
Sellers on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the
Sellers Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Sellers
and consistent with obligations under this Agreement, but the Sellers
Representative shall not be responsible to the Sellers for any loss or damages
the Sellers may suffer by the performance by the Sellers Representative of
its duties under this Agreement, other than loss or damage found by the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to arise from willful violation
of the law by the Sellers Representative in connection with its duties under
this Agreement. All decisions and actions by the Sellers Representative (to
the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the
Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. The Sellers Representative shall be entitled to
engage such counsel, experts, consultants and other advisors as it shall deem
necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing
its functions hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the
Sellers Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the
opinions and advice of such Persons. The Sellers Representative may (but need
not) consult with any Seller in connection with exercising its powers and
performing its functions hereunder and each Seller shall cooperate with and
offer reasonable assistance to the Sellers Representative in connection
therewith. In addition, the Sellers shall individually and ratably in
proportion to such Sellers Fraction (and not jointly and severally) indemnify
the Sellers Representative and hold the Sellers Representative harmless
against any loss or damages arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Sellers Representatives duties
hereunder, except any loss or damage found by the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction to arise from willful violation of the law by the
Sellers Representative in connection with its duties under this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Sellers Representative shall not be
liable to the Sellers for any apportionment or distribution of payments made
by the Sellers Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment
or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole
recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to
recover from other Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which they
are determined to have been entitled.

(c) The Sellers Representative may be changed by the Sellers from time to
time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Buyer,
provided that the Sellers Representative may not be removed unless holders of
a majority interest of the Fractions agree to such removal and to the
identity of the replacement Sellers Representative. 



 

\- 96 -  Any vacancy in the position of the Sellers Representative may be filled by
approval of the holders of a majority in interest of the Fractions.

Section 12.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or electronic transmission in
portable document format (pdf)), each of which shall be deemed an original,
but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 12.16 _Representation by Counsel_. EACH SELLER REPRESENTS AND AGREES
WITH EACH PARTY HERETO THAT HE, SHE, OR IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY, OR HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO BE REPRESENTED BY, INDEPENDENT COUNSEL OF HIS, HER, OR ITS OWN
CHOOSING, AND THAT HE, SHE, OR IT HAS HAD THE FULL RIGHT AND OPPORTUNITY TO
CONSULT WITH HIS, HER, OR ITS RESPECTIVE ATTORNEY(S), THAT TO THE EXTENT, IF
ANY, THAT HE, SHE, OR IT DESIRED, HE, SHE, OR IT AVAILED ITSELF OF THIS RIGHT
AND OPPORTUNITY, THAT HER, SHE, OR IT OR ITS AUTHORIZED OFFICERS (AS THE CASE
MAY BE) HAVE CAREFULLY READ AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT IN ITS
ENTIRETY AND HAVE HAD IT FULLY EXPLAINED TO THEM BY SUCH SELLERS RESPECTIVE
COUNSEL, THAT EACH SELLER IS FULLY AWARE OF THE CONTENTS THEREOF AND ITS
MEANING, INTENT AND LEGAL EFFECT, AND THAT HER, SHE, OR IT OR ITS AUTHORIZED
OFFICER (AS THE CASE MAY BE) IS COMPETENT TO EXECUTE THIS AGREEMENT AND HAS
EXECUTED THIS AGREEMENT FREE FROM COERCION, DURESS OR UNDUE INFLUENCE. THIS
AGREEMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO
REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL AND ANY RULES OF CONSTRUCTION RELATING TO
INTERPRETATION AGAINST THE DRAFTER OF AN AGREEMENT SHALL NOT APPLY TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ARE EXPRESSLY WAIVED. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, managers,
members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Kirkland and Ellis
LLP and Finn Dixon and Herling LLP may serve as counsel to each and any of the
Sellers Representative, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates
(individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), on the one hand, and
the Company or any Subsidiary on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Kirkland and Ellis LLP or
Finn Dixon and Herling LLP (or any of their respective successors) may serve as
counsel to the Seller Group or any director, manager, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such
representation or any continued representation of the Company, and each of
the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest
arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof
to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation. The Buyer further agrees that, as to all communications among
Kirkland and Ellis LLP or Finn Dixon and Herling LLP, the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries and the Seller Group that directly relate to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to the Sellers Representative on
behalf of the Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between the Buyer or a member 



 

\- 97 -  of the Seller Group and a third party other than a party to this Agreement
after the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Kirkland and Ellis LLP or
Finn Dixon and Herling LLP to such third party.

Section 12.17  _Liability Prior to Closing_. Prior to consummation of the
Closing, each of the Company, the Holdings Companies and the Sellers shall be
responsible for and bear sole liability with respect to its, his or her own
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements hereunder and in no
event shall any of the Company, the Holding Companies or the Sellers be liable
for, and the Buyer shall not seek to recover from any of the Company, the
Holding Companies or the Sellers for any Losses arising out, a breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by any other party hereto.

Section 12.18 _No Additional Representations; Disclaimer_.

(a) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of the Sellers, the
Holding Companies or the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives, nor any other Person acting on behalf of the Sellers, the
Holding Companies or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives has made any (and the Buyer and its Affiliates have not
relied on any) representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Holding Companies,
the Company or the Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or assets,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or as set forth in the
Schedules. The Sellers Representative, the Sellers, the Holding Companies and
the Company acknowledge and agree that neither the Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates or representatives, nor any other Person acting on behalf of
the Buyer or its Affiliates or representatives has made any (and the Sellers
Representative, the Sellers, the Holding Companies and the Company and their
respective Affiliates have not relied on any) representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Buyer or its businesses or assets, except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement or as set forth in the Schedules. The Buyer further agrees
that no Seller Indemnitee nor any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives will have or be subject to any liability to the Buyer or any
other Person to the extent resulting from the distribution to the Buyer, or
the Buyers use, of any information, document or material made available to
the Buyer or its Affiliates or representatives, whether in certain "data
rooms" and "data sites" or otherwise, in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "made
available to the Buyer" shall mean that such materials were delivered to the
Buyer or its representatives or posted on the electronic data site
maintained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the date of
this Agreement.

(b) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without reliance on any representation or
warranty, express or implied, by the Company, the Holding Companies, the
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives except for
the representations and warranties of the Sellers, the Holding Companies and
the Company expressly set forth in _Article II_ , _Article III_  and _Article
IV_. The Sellers Representative, the Sellers, the Holding Companies and the
Company acknowledge and agree that they are consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without reliance on any representation
or warranty, express or implied, by the 



 

\- 98 -  Buyer or any of its Affiliates or representatives except for the
representations and warranties of the Buyer expressly set forth in Article V.

(c) In connection with the Buyers investigation of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, the Buyer has received from or on behalf of the Company and the
Subsidiaries certain projections, including projected statements of operating
revenues and income from operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries and
certain prospective business plan information of the Company and
the Subsidiaries. The Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans, and that the Buyer shall have no claim against any Seller
Indemnitee or any other Person with respect thereto. Accordingly, none of the
Company, the Subsidiaries or the Seller Indemnitees makes any representations
or warranties whatsoever with respect to such estimates, projections and other
forecasts and plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and the Buyer has not
relied thereon.

(d) Nothing in this Section 12.18 shall in any way limit any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article II, Article III, Article
IV or Article V.
