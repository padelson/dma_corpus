Estate Partners IV L.P.    iii       AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER,
dated as of October 20, 2004 (this "Agreement"), among BATON HOLDINGS INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), BATON ACQUISITION INC., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and BOCA
RESORTS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").   WHEREAS, the
respective Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
deem it in the best interests of their respective stockholders or members, as
the case may be, to consummate the merger (the "Merger"), on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, of Merger Sub with and
into the Company in which the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent, and such Boards of Directors have approved this Agreement and
declared its advisability (and, in the case of the Board of Directors of the
Company (the "Company Board"), recommended that this Agreement be adopted by
the Company\'s stockholders);   WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parent and
Merger Sub entering into this Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of
the Company are entering into a voting agreement simultaneously with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement pursuant to which, among other
things, such stockholders have agreed, subject to the terms thereof, to vote
their shares of the Company Common Stock (as defined below) in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement; and   WHEREAS, upon consummation of the Merger,
each issued and outstanding share of Class A common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Company (the "Company Class A Common Stock", and each issued
and outstanding share of Class B common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
the Company (the "Company Class B Common Stock" and, together with the
Company Class A Common Stock, the "Company Common Stock"), will be converted
into the right to receive $24.00 per share in cash, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   SECTION
1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
Article VII, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").       SECTION 1.02 Closing. Unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 9:00 a.m., New York
time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which date shall be (a) no
earlier than November 19, 2004 without Parent\'s consent and (b) no later
than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those that by their terms are
to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), at the offices of Shearman and
Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, unless another
time, date and/or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company.   SECTION 1.03 Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable after
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the
parties hereto shall (i) file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and (ii) make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effect the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger
becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective
Time".   SECTION 1.04 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time,
the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in Section 259 of the DGCL.  
SECTION 1.05 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. (a) At the Effective Time,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended to read in its entirety as set
forth in Exhibit A attached hereto and, as so amended, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and as provided
by Law.   (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Company, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and
restated to read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto
and, as so amended and restated, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.   SECTION 1.06
Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal.   SECTION 1.07 Other Transactions. Parent shall have
the option, in its sole discretion and without requiring the further consent
of the Company or the Company\'s Board of Directors or stockholders, upon
reasonable notice to the Company, to request that the Company, immediately
prior to the Closing, (a) convert one or more Subsidiaries that are organized
as    2    corporations into limited liability companies and one or
more Subsidiaries that are organized as limited partnerships into limited
liability companies, on the basis of organizational documents as reasonably
requested by Parent, and (b) sell to an affiliate of Parent all of the stock,
limited partnership interests or limited liability interests owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Company in one or more Subsidiaries at a price
designated by Parent based on a third-party appraisal of the assets and
liabilities of such Subsidiary; provided, however, that (i) the Company shall
not be required to take any action in contravention of any organizational
document or other Material Contract relating to any applicable Subsidiary,
(ii) any such actions or transactions shall be contingent upon the receipt by
the Company of a written notice from Parent confirming that Parent and Merger
Sub are prepared to proceed immediately with the Closing (it being understood
that in any event the transactions described in clauses (a) and (b) will be
deemed to have occurred prior to the Closing), and (iii) such actions (or the
inability to complete such actions) shall not affect or modify in any respect
the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, including
payment of the Merger Consideration. Parent shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company in connection with any actions taken by the Company
in accordance with this Section 1.07. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint
and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
its Representatives for and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with such actions.   ARTICLE
II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   SECTION 2.01
Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any of the following securities:   (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock.
Each share of Company  Common Stock (all issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock  being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Shares") issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any  Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and any
Dissenting  Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically
into the  right to receive $24.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger 
Consideration"), payable upon surrender, in the manner provided in  Section
2.02, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share.   (b)
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.  Each Share held in
the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by  Merger Sub, Parent or
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of  Parent or of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall  automatically be canceled
without any conversion thereof and no payment  or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto.   (c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of
common stock,  par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective    3     Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid  and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of  the Surviving
Corporation.   SECTION 2.02 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), and (ii)
enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent for the payment of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. At the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit,
with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent; provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of cash which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.01(a), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if the Certificate representing such Shares shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each
Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to
this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II.    4     (c) No Further Rights. From and after the Effective
Time, holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders
of the Company, except as provided herein or by Law.   (d) Termination of
Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for
the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (e) No Liability.
None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any cash (including any dividends
or distributions with respect to such Shares) delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   (f)
Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment
under all applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   (g) Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if required by the
Surviving Corporation, (A) in the event such person is a holder of over 10
Shares, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
the Surviving Corporation may direct, or (B) in the event such person is a
holder of 10 or fewer Shares, reasonable personal assurances from such
person, in each case as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.01(a).   SECTION 2.03 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall
be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates representing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the
Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for
any reason shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).   
5     SECTION 2.04 Company Stock Options. (a) Between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action
(which action shall be effective as of the Effective Time),
including obtaining the consent of the individual option holders and the
adoption of Company Board resolutions, if necessary, to (i) terminate the
Company\'s Third Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan ( the "Company
Stock Option Plan"), and (ii) cancel, as of the Effective Time, each option
to purchase Shares granted under the Company Stock Option Plan (each, a
"Company Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised, as of the
Effective Time (in each case, without the creation of additional liability to
the Company or any Subsidiaries).   (b) Each holder of a Company Stock
Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time and has
an exercise price per Share that is less than the per share Merger
Consideration shall (subject to the provisions of this Section 2.04) be paid
by the Surviving Corporation, in exchange for the cancellation of such
Company Stock Option, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable
withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (i) the difference between the per
share Merger Consideration and the applicable exercise price of such Company
Stock Option, and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares issuable upon exercise
of such Company Stock Option (the "Option Payment"). The Surviving
Corporation shall make the Option Payments as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time. Any such payments shall be subject to all applicable
federal, state and local Tax withholding requirements.   SECTION 2.05
Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, Shares that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands the appraisal for
such Shares (the "Dissenting Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262")
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration. Any such stockholder shall instead be entitled to receive
payment of the fair value of such stockholder\'s Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262; provided, however, that
all Dissenting Shares held by any stockholder who shall have failed to
perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such stockholder\'s
rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.02
of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.  
(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.    6     ARTICLE III  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as set forth in the
disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule") (provided that disclosure of any fact or item in any
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall, should the existence of
such fact or item be relevant to any other section, be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to that other section so long as the relevance of such
disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:   SECTION 3.01
Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a) Each of the Company and
each subsidiary of the Company (each a "Subsidiary") is a corporation,
limited liability company, limited partnership or limited liability
partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power and
authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.
Each of the Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any
event, circumstance, development, change or effect that, individually or in
the aggregate with all other events, circumstances, developments, changes
and effects, is materially adverse to the business, operations, assets,
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company
and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole or would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Transactions") or
prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of the Company to perform
its obligations hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall any of
the following, alone or in combination, be deemed to constitute, nor shall
any of the following be taken into account in determining whether there has
been, or will be, a Company Material Adverse Effect: any event, circumstance,
change or effect resulting from or relating to (i) a change in general
economic or financial market conditions, (ii) a change in industry
conditions, (iii) seasonal fluctuations in the business of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, (iv) any acts of terrorism or war (except to the extent
such event, circumstance, change or effect has had a disproportionate effect
on the Company and the Subsidiaries as compared to other persons in the
industry in which the Company and the Subsidiaries conduct their business),
(v) the announcement of the execution of this Agreement or the pendency or
consummation of the Transactions, or (vi) compliance with the terms of, or
the taking of any action required by, this Agreement; provided further that
the exceptions set forth in clauses (v) and (vi) will not apply with respect
to the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.05.   (b) A
true and complete list of all the Subsidiaries, together with the
jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary and the percentage of the
outstanding capital    7    stock or other equity interests of each
Subsidiary owned by the Company, each other Subsidiary and any other person,
is set forth in Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (c)
Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists any and all persons
of which the Company directly or indirectly owns an equity or similar
interest, or an interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
an equity or similar interest, of less than 50% (collectively, the
"Investments"). The Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, owns
all Investments free and clear of all Liens, and there are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary
permitting the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of any of its
interest in the Investments or to provide funds to, or make any investment
(in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, or provide any
guarantee with respect to, any Investment.   (d) Section 3.01(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the following information in respect
of Boca Raton Hotel and Club Limited Partnership, a Florida limited
partnership ("Old Boca") and its ownership interest in Panthers BRHC Limited,
a Florida limited partnership ("New Boca"): (i) a list of all persons holding
a partnership interest in Old Boca (including a list of all Class A limited
partners of Old Boca) as of the date of this Agreement, along with the number
of units held by such limited partners in Old Boca as of the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) each person owning an partnership interest in BRMC, L.P.,
a Delaware limited partnership ("BRMC LP"), as of the date of this Agreement,
along with the class and percentage of such person\'s ownership interest as
of the date of this Agreement. Old Boca does not hold any direct equity or
similar interest in the Company or any Subsidiary other than the interest it
holds in New Boca. The Company has provided to Parent complete and correct
copies of the Old Boca and BRMC LP partnership agreements, each as amended to
date. Pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Contribution and Exchange
Agreement, dated as of March 20, 1997 (the "Contribution and Exchange
Agreement"), the Company has the option to acquire, directly or through its
designee, the general partnership interest in Old Boca held by BRMC LP for
$1.00, and such right is valid, remains in full force and effect and has not
expired. Other than BRMC LP, no person holds any general partnership interest
in Old Boca.   SECTION 3.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of
the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws or similar organizational
documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each Subsidiary. Such
Certificates of Incorporation and Bylaws or similar organizational documents
are in full force and effect and no other organizational documents are
applicable or binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary is, nor has the Company been, in violation of
any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or
similar organizational documents. No Subsidiary has been in material
violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation,
Bylaws or similar organizational documents. The Company has made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of the minutes of all meetings of the

6.01 Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders\' Meeting. (a) As promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement (but in any event within 10
business days unless the parties shall otherwise agree), the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its
affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is
customarily included in proxy statements prepared in connection
with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand relating to the Proxy
Statement. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, any
information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent an opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response and shall include in such
document or response comments reasonably proposed by Parent; provided,
however, that in the event of a Change in Board Recommendation, the Company
shall consider in good faith including in such document or response comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.   (b) The Company shall duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
Stockholders\' Meeting"), as promptly as practicable after the   
31    date of this Agreement, for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder
Approval. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
Section 8.01, the Company shall hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting
regardless of whether the Company Board has effected a Change in Board
Recommendation. Subject to Section 6.03(c), the Company Board shall (i)
recommend to holders of the Shares that they adopt this Agreement, (ii)
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain the Stockholder Approval.  
SECTION 6.02 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Except as otherwise
prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any Contract entered into prior
to the date hereof or would be reasonably expected to violate any attorney-
client privilege, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
the Company shall (and shall cause the Subsidiaries to), at Parent\'s
expense: (i) provide to Parent and to the officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financing sources, agents and other
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") of Parent

notice by Parent, to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and
other facilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries and to the books and
records thereof, and (ii) furnish promptly to Parent such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities,
personnel and other aspects of the Company and the Subsidiaries as Parent or
its Representatives may reasonably request. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent and its Representatives (including its financing sources) shall have
the right to conduct appraisal and environmental and engineering inspections
of each of the Company\'s properties, provided, however, (A) that unless
reasonably required by the financing sources in connection with the Debt
Financing, neither Parent nor its Representatives shall have the right to
take and analyze any samples of any environmental media (including soil,
groundwater, surface water, air or sediment) or any building material or to
perform any invasive testing procedure on any building; and that any such
taking and analyzing of samples or any such performance of invasive testing
conducted pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company, implemented in a manner that does not disrupt the operations of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, and paid for by Parent at Parent\'s
sole cost and expense; and that Parent, at Parent\'s sole cost and expense,
shall return any site at which or from which, or that has otherwise been
affected by, any taking and analyzing of samples or performance of invasive
testing conducted pursuant to this Section 6.02, in all material respects, to
the condition existing at such site prior to the taking and analyzing of
samples or performance of invasive testing, and (B) Parent and Merger Sub
shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
the Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them arising out of any
personal injury or physical damage resulting from any appraisal or inspection
conducted pursuant to this Section 6.02, except that, Parent and Merger Sub
shall have no obligation to so indemnify or hold harmless to the extent any
such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments or penalties result from the negligence of the Company, the
Subsidiaries, or one of their Representatives.   (b) All information
obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall
be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated
August 30, 2004 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between Blackstone Real
Estate Acquisitions IV L.L.C. and the Company.    32     (c) No
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall affect any representation
or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the
obligations of the parties hereto.   SECTION 6.03 No Solicitation of
Transactions. (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary
shall, nor shall it authorize or permit the Representatives of the Company or
the Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate or
knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate (including by way of
furnishing information) any inquiries or the implementation or submission of
any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information in connection
with, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that, prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders at the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company or the Company Board from furnishing information to, or engaging in
negotiations or discussions with, any person in connection with an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such person, if and
only to the extent that prior to taking such action (A) the Company Board
believes in good faith (after consultation with its advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in,
a Superior Proposal, and the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is required to do
so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law, and (B) the Company Board receives from such
person an executed confidentiality agreement, the terms of which are
substantially similar to and no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. Except as set forth in this
Section 6.03, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall enter into any
letter of intent, acquisition agreement or similar agreement with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in this Section 6.03(a)).   (b) The Company shall notify Parent as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours) of the receipt by the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives, of any bona fide inquiries, proposals or offers, requests
for information or requests for discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions thereof
and the identity of the party making such proposal. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations and of any modifications to such inquiries, proposals or offers
(the Company agreeing that it shall not, and shall cause the Subsidiaries not
to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to
the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent). The Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary
shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing
standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of
the Subsidiaries is a party and that it and the Subsidiaries shall enforce
the provisions of any such agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause
the Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties that
may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal as of the date
hereof, shall take reasonable steps to inform its and the Subsidiaries\'
Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.03 and shall
request that all confidential information previously furnished to any such
third parties be returned promptly.    33     (c) Except as set forth
in this Section 6.03, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not,
and shall not publicly propose to, (i) withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions by the Company Board (or any
committee thereof); (ii) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or
(iii) approve any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or similar
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in this Section 6.03). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s
stockholders at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, (x) in response to the
receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if
the Company Board (A) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and
(B) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then the
Company Board may approve and recommend such Superior Proposal and, in
connection with such Superior Proposal, withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation or (y) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
then the Company Board may withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation (either event described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y),
a "Change in Board Recommendation").   (d) Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company\'s
stockholders if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is
required to do so under applicable Law; provided, however, that neither the
Company nor the Company Board (nor any committee thereof) shall (i) recommend
that the stockholders of the Company tender their Shares in connection with
any such tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation, unless in the case of each of clause (d)(i) and (d)(ii)
hereof, the requirements of Section 6.03(c) shall have been satisfied.   (e)
Except as set forth in Section 8.03(d) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement:   (i) "Acquisition Proposal" means
any proposal or offer  (including any proposal from or to the Company\'s
stockholders) from any  person other than Parent or Merger Sub relating to
(1) any direct or  indirect acquisition of (A) more than 15% of the assets of
the Company  and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) more
than  15% of any class of equity securities of the Company; (2) any tender 
offer or exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that  if
consummated, would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or  more of
any class of equity securities of the Company; or (3) any  merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,  liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the  Company.   
34     (ii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written  Acquisition
Proposal not solicited or initiated in violation of Section  6.03(a) that (i)
relates to more than 50% of the outstanding Shares or  all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company and the  Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii)
is on terms that the Company Board  determines in its good faith judgment
(after receiving the advice of  its financial advisor and after taking into
account all the terms and  conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) are more
favorable to the  Company\'s stockholders (in their capacities as
stockholders) from a  financial point of view than this Agreement (including
any alterations  to this Agreement agreed to in writing by Parent in response
thereto)  and (iii) which the Company Board determines is reasonably capable
of  being consummated.   SECTION 6.04 Directors\' and Officers\'
Indemnification and Insurance. (a) The Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set forth
in Article EIGHTH of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, and
Article IV of the Bylaws of the Company, respectively, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries.   (b) After the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and
former director and officer of the Company and each Subsidiary (collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties") against all costs and expenses (including
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary or agent, occurring on or before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Company or any other applicable contract or agreement in effect
on the date of this Agreement. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are received (provided the
applicable Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay all advanced
expenses if it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification), (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any pending or threatened Action to which an Indemnified Party is a party
(and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified
Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (iii)
the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter;
provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving
Corporation\'s written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); and provided further that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.04(b) to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality
of    35    the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single action except to the
extent that two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting
interests in the outcome of such action; and provided further that, in the
event that any claim for indemnification is asserted or made within such six
year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall
continue until the disposition of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified
Person under this Section 6.04(b) shall be in addition to any rights such
person may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the
Company and the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, or under
any Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.   (c) The Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
cause to be obtained at the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with respect to
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance in amount and scope at least
as favorable as the Company\'s existing policies for claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; or (ii)
maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time, if available, the
current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies maintained by
the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that
are not less favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.04(c) more than
an amount per year equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by the
Company for such insurance; provided, however, that in the event of an
expiration, termination or cancellation of such current policies, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is
possible under substantially similar policies for such maximum annual amount
in aggregate annual premiums. The Company represents that such current annual
premium amount is set forth in Section 6.04(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.   (d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.04.   (e) Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations of
the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.04.   SECTION 6.05 Employee
Benefits Matters. (a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of two years
immediately following the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to, (i) provide each employee of
the Company as of the Effective Time (each, an "Employee") with at least the
same level of base salary, cash incentive compensation and other variable
cash compensation that was provided to each such Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide the Employees with employee benefits
(other than equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their
terms, all contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and   
36    commitments of the Company and the Subsidiaries as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are applicable to any current or
former employees or directors of the Company or any Subsidiary.   (b)
Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including, for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to
receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective subsidiaries under which each Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized
by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Such plan, program or arrangement shall credit
each such Employee for service accrued or deemed accrued on or prior to the
Effective Time with the Company, any Subsidiary and all affiliates where
service with the affiliate was credited under a comparable Plan of the
Company prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that such crediting
of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any
such benefit.   (c) Without limiting any of the foregoing, Parent agrees
that it shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide
severance benefits to Employees eligible to participate in the Boca Resorts,
Inc. Severance Plan and who are terminated during the two-year period
immediately following the Effective Time in an amount that is at least equal
to the severance benefits that would have been paid to such Employees
pursuant to the terms of the Boca Resorts, Inc. Severance Plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (d) With respect to the welfare
benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed
to by Parent or the Surviving Corporation ("Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans")
in which an Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective
Time, Parent shall (a) waive, or cause its insurance carrier to waive, all
limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Employee under any
Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a comparable
Plan, and (b) provide credit to each Employee for any co-payments,
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Employee under the Plans
during the relevant plan year, up to and including the Effective Time.  
SECTION 6.06 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-

respect, in the case of representations or warranties qualified by
the "material" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifier, and (b) any
failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply

prompt written notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication
(i) from any    37    person and the response thereto of the Company or
the Subsidiaries or Parent, as the case may be, or its or their
Representatives alleging that the consent of such person is or may be
required in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) from any
Governmental Authority and the response thereto of the Company or the
Subsidiaries or Parent, as the case may be, or its or their Representatives

Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to satisfy
all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in such definitive
agreements that are within its control. In the event any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or
more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Parent). Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach
by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or any termination of the Debt
Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing and shall not permit any material amendment or modification to
be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the
Commitment Letters without first consulting with the Company.   (b) The
Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
(provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries), including
(i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions,
(ii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, (iii) assisting Parent and its financing sources in the preparation
of (A) an offering document for any debt raised to complete the Merger and
(B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any debt
raised by Parent to complete the Merger, (v) forming new direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, and (vi) providing and executing documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent; provided that none of the Company or any Subsidiary
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
the Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent and Merger Sub
shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
the Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than historical information relating to the
Company or the Subsidiaries).    38     (c) All non-public or
otherwise confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent
or its Representatives pursuant to Section 6.07(b) shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.   (d) Within 60 days of
there having occurred after the date of this Agreement (i) any general
suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on the NYSE
for three or more consecutive business days, including but not limited to any
changes in trading conditions resulting from actual or threatened terrorist
attacks, responses by the United States or its allies thereto, or the effects
thereof; (ii) the declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of
payments in respect of banks in the United States or New York for three or
more consecutive business days; (iii) the commencement or material escalation
of a war, armed hostilities or other international or national crisis or
security event directly or indirectly involving the United States or any of
its territories after the date of this Agreement, including without
limitation, any acts of terrorism, domestic or foreign or responses of the
United States or its allies, or a national or international economic or
financial crisis, the result of which there has occurred any material
disruption or material adverse change in the United State commercial credit,
debt capital or commercial mortgage-backed securities markets for a period of
three or more consecutive business days; or (iv) any limitation by any
governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or authority
which prohibits the extension of credit by banks or other lending
institutions in the United States or New York in a manner that prevents
Lender from providing the Debt Financing for a period of three or more
consecutive business days, Parent shall deliver to the Company a certificate
(the "Market MAC Notice") to that effect signed by an officer of Parent,
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Market MAC (any of the
events specified in clauses (i) through (iv) described in such Market MAC
Notice being hereinafter referred to as a "Market MAC"); provided, however,
that in no event shall Parent be entitled to deliver more than one Market MAC
Notice. At any time following its receipt of the Market MAC Notice, the
Company may request (by delivery of a written notice to Parent to such effect
(a "Company Waiver Request")) that Parent fully and irrevocably waive its
right to invoke the condition set forth in Section 7.02(d) with respect to
such Market MAC. In the event that Parent delivers to the Company a written
notice that Parent waives its right to invoke the condition set forth in
Section 7.02(d) with respect to such Market MAC (a "Parent Waiver Notice"),
then such Market MAC shall cease to be a basis for Parent or Merger Sub not
consummating the Merger, and the condition set forth in Section 7.02(d) shall
no longer exist with respect to such or any other Market MAC. In the
event that Parent fails to deliver a Parent Waiver Notice with respect to a
Market MAC within the longer of (i) seven days after Parent\'s receipt of the
corresponding Company Waiver Request and (ii) the number of days between the
date on which Parent delivered to the Company the corresponding Market MAC
Notice and the date on which the Company delivered to Parent the Company
Waiver Request (the longer of such periods being hereinafter referred to as
the "Requisite Response Period"), then the Company shall be entitled to
terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(j). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 6.07(d), nothing shall release Parent from
continuing to be obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (i)
the Debt Financing or (ii) an alternative financing in accordance with
Section 6.07(a) in the event Parent declines to timely waive its right to
invoke the condition set forth in Section 7.02(d) with respect to a Market
MAC.    39     SECTION 6.08 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.
(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise
to consummate and make effective the Transactions, and (ii) obtain from
Governmental Authorities and third parties any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by
Parent or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement.   (b) As
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any
additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act.   (c) Subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections, each of Parent and the Company shall have the
right to review and approve in advance drafts of all applications, notices,
petitions, filings and other documents made or prepared in connection with
the items described in clauses (a) and (b) above, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, shall furnish to the other
party such necessary information and assistance as such other party may
reasonably request with respect to the foregoing and shall provide the
other party with copies of all filings made by such party with any
applicable Government Authority, and, upon request, any other information
supplied by such party to a Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions.   (d) Parent and Merger Sub agree to take
whatever action as may be necessary or required by any Governmental Authority
to resolve any objections asserted under the HSR Act or any other applicable
federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws with respect to
the Transactions (including, without limitation, agreeing to hold separate or
to divest any of the businesses, products or assets of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any of their respective affiliates) or to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any non-appealable permanent injunction or
other final judgment that has the effect of preventing the consummation of
any of the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no action taken by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section
6.08(d) shall entitle Parent to any diminution of the Merger Consideration,
and the Company shall not be required to divest or hold separate any assets
or businesses or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to any of the Company\'s direct or indirect
assets or businesses.   (e) Merger Sub, the Company, and Parent shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents
(i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions, (ii)
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or (iii) required to prevent a
Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to the Effective Time.
In the event that the Company shall fail to obtain any third party consent
described above, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall
take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any
adverse effect upon the Company and Parent and their respective businesses
resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after the
Effective Time, from the    40    failure to obtain such consent. In
addition, at the request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to assist Parent in obtaining (A) any estoppel certificates from any
ground lessor under the ground leases underlying the Leased Properties, and
(B) customary "comfort" letters from any franchisors or licensors under any
franchise or license agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a
party.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any person (other than
a Governmental Authority) with respect to the Merger or any
other Transaction, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such person and
(ii) none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates shall be
required to pay or commit to pay to such person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or to
incur any liability or other obligation.   SECTION 6.09 Obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger
Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.   SECTION 6.10 Public Announcements. The initial press
release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of
which has been agreed to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, each
of Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, except to the extent public disclosure
is required by applicable Law or the requirements of the NYSE, in which case
the issuing party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the
other party before issuing any press release or making any such public
statements.   SECTION 6.11 Transfer Taxes. The Company and Parent
shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all
returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any sales,
transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or
gains and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees to assume liability for and pay any sales, transfer,
stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or gains and
any similar Taxes, as well as any transfer, recording, registration and other
fees that may be imposed upon, payable or incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions.   SECTION 6.12 Resignations. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the
Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation
effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary designated by Parent to the Company in writing at least 20
calendar days prior to the Closing.    41     SECTION 6.13 Termination
of Management Agreement. The Company agrees that neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary shall terminate, amend, modify or otherwise in any way alter that
certain Termination Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "Termination
Agreement"), by and between the Company and Huizenga Holdings, Inc., which
provides for the termination as of the Effective Time, and without any
further obligation on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary, of that
certain Management Agreement, effective as of the first day of June, 1996, as
amended, by and between Florida Panthers Holdings, Inc. (predecessor to the
Company) and Huizenga Holdings, Inc. In addition, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall retrieve all books and records of the Company or of
any Subsidiary that are held or otherwise maintained pursuant to such
Management Agreement or otherwise held or maintained by any affiliate of the
Company (other than any Subsidiary).   SECTION 6.14 Matters Relating to New
Boca and Cosmos Group. (a) Prior to Closing, the Company shall, unless
otherwise directed in writing by Parent, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to, or to cause its applicable Subsidiary to: (i) complete the
transactions set forth on Section 6.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and (ii) exercise the Company\'s right pursuant to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement for Rolling Hills Golf Course, dated September 4, 1997, by and
among Florida Golf Management, Inc., Rolling Hills International Country
Club, Ltd., Space Development, Ltd., Broward Anchor International,
Ltd., Rolling Hills Hotel, Ltd., Cosmos Group, Inc., and International
Dining, Ltd. to acquire, and acquire, the general partnership interest in
Florida Golf Management, Inc. held by Cosmos Group, Inc.; provided, however,
that Parent acknowledges that the actions contemplated by this Section
6.14(a) may not be completed prior to the Closing.   (b) Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs (which, for the sake of clarity, shall not
include the purchase price payable in connection with the transactions
described in Section 6.14(a)) incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with the matters set forth in this Section 6.14. Parent and Merger
Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, each Subsidiary and their respective Representatives for and against
any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection
with such matters.   SECTION 6.15 Real Estate Acquisition. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete, on terms acceptable to
the Company, the acquisition of the real property described on Section 6.15
of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that the Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the status of such proposed
acquisition; and provided, further, that the Company shall not agree to a
purchase price with respect to such proposed acquisition that is in excess of
the price currently contemplated without the prior consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   SECTION 6.16 Soil

the owner of the Grande Oaks Golf Course, with respect to a soil assessment
report and soil removal strategy for a portion of the Grande Oaks Golf Course
termed Parcel 5. The Company covenants    42    and agrees that, unless
revisions to the Residential Soil Cleanup Target Level for Arsenic to
2.1mg/kg (as recommended in the proposed legislative change to Chapter 62-777
of the Florida Administrative Code referred to in the Soil Removal Approval
Letter) is denied beyond any rights of appeal, it shall either (a) cause FGM

Approval Letter, and deliver a Soil Removal Report to BCDPEP with respect to
the completion of such soil removal strategy, in each case no later than

warranties to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any

Meeting, as follows (the date of any such termination, the "Termination
Date"):   (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;   (b)
by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time  shall not have
occurred on or before April 20, 2005; provided, however,  that the right to

to any party whose failure to fulfill any  obligation under this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in,  the failure of the Effective Time to
occur on or before such date;   (c) by either Parent or the Company if any
Governmental  Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered  any injunction, order, decree or ruling (whether temporary,
preliminary  or permanent) or taken any other action (including the failure

the  effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise 
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger;   (d) by Parent, if
neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in material  breach of its obligations under
this Agreement, and if (i) any of the  representations and warranties of the
Company herein become untrue or  inaccurate such that Section 7.02(a) would
not be satisfied, or (ii)  there has been a breach on the part of the Company
of any of its  covenants or agreements herein such that Section 7.02(b) would
not be  satisfied, and, in either such case, such breach (if curable) has

Company Stockholders\'  Meeting, if the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after  consultation with its advisors), in the exercise of its
fiduciary  duties, that an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal is a 
Superior Proposal, but only (i) after providing written notice to  Parent (a
"Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Parent that the  Company Board has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material  terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal and identifying the  person making such Superior
Proposal, and (ii) if Parent does not,  within three (3) business days of
Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of  Superior Proposal, make an offer that the
Company Board determines, in  its good faith judgment (after consultation
with its advisors) to be at  least as favorable to the Company\'s
stockholders as such Superior  Proposal; provided that during such three
business day period, the  Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
(to the extent Parent  wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to make such an
offer; provided,  however, that any such purported termination pursuant to
this Section  8.01(h) shall be void and of no force or effect unless the
Company  concurrently with such termination pays to Parent the Company 
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.03; and provided further  that
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that  concurrently with
such termination the Company may enter into a  definitive agreement providing
for implementation of such Superior  Proposal;   (i) by the Company if,
after the conditions set forth in  Section 7.01 and Sections 7.02(a), 7.02(b)
and, unless deemed no longer  to exist in accordance with Section 6.07(d),
7.02(d) have been  satisfied and within five business days after the Company

conditions, the  Merger shall not have been consummated; provided, however,
that for  purposes of this Section 8.01(i), neither the condition set forth
in  Section 7.01(b) (as such condition relates to any law, rule, 
regulation, judgment, decree, executive order or award relating to  antitrust
matters) nor the condition set forth in Section 7.01(c) need  have been
satisfied if Parent and Merger Sub have not complied in all  material
respects with their obligations under Section 6.08; or   (j) by the Company
if Parent fails to deliver a Parent Waiver  Notice prior to the expiration of
the Requisite Response Period with  respect to any Market MAC.   SECTION

provisions of Sections 6.02(b) and 6.07(c), this Section 8.02, Section 8.03

nothing herein shall relieve the Company from liability for any willful
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.   SECTION 8.03 Fees and
Expenses. (a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.03, all

or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement, the preparation, printing, filing and mailing

be terminated:   (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(d), then the
Company  shall pay Parent the Termination Expenses and, further, if (A) at
or  prior to the Termination Date, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been 
publicly announced and (B) if concurrently with such termination or  within
12 months of the Termination Date, the Company enters into, or  submits to

announced at or prior to the Termination  Date), or an Acquisition Proposal
(which need not be the same  Acquisition Proposal as the Acquisition Proposal
described above that  shall have been publicly announced at or prior to the
Termination Date)  is consummated, then the Company shall pay Parent the
Company  Termination Fee;   (ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(f),  and, at or prior to the Termination Date, an Acquisition
Proposal shall  have been publicly announced, then (A) the Company shall pay

pursuant to Section 8.01(g), then (so long as  neither Parent nor Merger Sub
was in material breach of any of its  representations, warranties or
covenants in this Agreement as of the  Termination Date) the Company shall
pay Parent the Company Termination  Fee; or    47     (iv) by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.01(h), then the  Company shall pay to Parent
the Company Termination Fee (which Company  Termination Fee shall be paid
concurrently with such termination).   (c) The Company Termination Fee shall
be paid to Parent or its designee by the Company in immediately available
funds (i) concurrently with and as a condition to the effectiveness of a
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(h) and
(ii) within two business days after the date of the event giving rise to the
obligation to make such payment in all other circumstances. The Termination
Expenses shall be paid to Parent or its designee by the Company in
immediately available funds within two business days after receipt by the
Company of reasonable documentation with respect to such Expenses. In no
event shall the Company be required to pay under Section 8.03(b) an amount in
excess of $38,000,000.   (d) (i) For purposes of this Section 8.03,
Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section
6.03(e), except that references to 15% in clauses (1) and (2) of the
definition thereof shall be deemed to be references to 50% and clause (3) of
the definition thereof shall be deemed amended and replaced in its entirety
by the following language "(3) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving the
Company pursuant to which stockholders of the Company immediately prior to
the consummation of such transaction would cease to own directly or
indirectly at least 50% of the voting power of the outstanding securities of
the Company (or of another person that directly or indirectly would own all
or substantially all the assets of the Company) immediately following such
transaction in the same proportion as they owned prior to the consummation of
such transaction".   (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company
Termination Fee" means an amount equal to $38,000,000, less the Termination
Expenses, if any, previously paid or payable to Parent pursuant to Section
8.03(b).   (iii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Termination
Expenses" means an amount, not to exceed $5,000,000, equal to the reasonably
documented Expenses of Parent and Merger Sub.   (e) Parent agrees that, if
the Company shall terminate this Agreement (i) pursuant to Section 8.01(e),
(ii) pursuant to Section 8.01(b) and, at the time of such termination, the
conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Sections 7.02(a), 7.02(b) and,
unless deemed no longer to exist in accordance with Section 6.07(d), 7.02(d)
have been satisfied; provided, however, that for purposes of this Section
8.03(e)(ii), neither the condition set forth in Section 7.01(b) (as such
condition relates to any law, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, executive
order or award relating to antitrust matters) nor the condition set forth in
Section 7.01(c) need have been satisfied if Parent and Merger Sub have not
complied in all material respects with their obligations under Section 6.08,
or (iii) pursuant to Section 8.01(i), then Parent shall pay to the Company a
fee of $38,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") in immediately available
funds no later than two business days after such termination by the
Company.   (f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 8.03 are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this    48    Agreement. In the event
that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee or any
Termination Expenses when due or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent
Termination Fee when due, the Company or the Parent, as the case may be,
shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and
expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this Section 8.03. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company\'s right to receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.03 shall be the exclusive
remedy of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the loss suffered as a result
of the failure of the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated,
and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with this
Section 8.03, none of Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions (except with respect to the second sentence of this Section
8.03(f), indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub contained in Sections 1.07, 5.01, 6.02(a), 6.07(b) and 6.14 and the
provisions of Section 6.02(b) and 6.07(c)).   SECTION 8.04 Amendment. This
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on
behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that, after the adoption of this Agreement
and the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall
be made except as allowed under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.   SECTION 8.05 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or
other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any
agreement of any other party or any condition to its own obligations
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.
The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.   ARTICLE IX  
GENERAL PROVISIONS   SECTION 9.01 Non-Survival of Representations,
Warranties and Agreements. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall terminate at
the Effective Time. This Section 9.01 shall not limit any covenant or

Term Location of Definition  ------------ ----------------------  
Transactions................................... ss. 3.01(a)    (c) When a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or Exhibits, such
reference shall be to a Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement,
respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular provision of this
Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms. References to a person are also to its permitted successors
and assigns. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include
the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms.   SECTION 9.04
Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.   SECTION 9.05 Disclaimer of Other
Representations and Warranties. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in this Agreement (a) no party makes, and has not made,
any representations or warranties relating to itself or its businesses or
otherwise in connection with the Transactions, (b) no person has been
authorized by any party to make any representation or warranty relating
itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions
and, if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon as
having been authorized by such party, and (c) any estimates, projections,
predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any
other materials or information provided or addressed to any party or any of
its Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include
representations or warranties unless any such materials or information is the
subject of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement.  
SECTION 9.06 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned
(whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except that
Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights and obligations
hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of   
54    Parent, provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve the
assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not
perform such obligations.   SECTION 9.07 Parties in Interest. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party
hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.04
(which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and
may be enforced by such persons).   SECTION 9.08 Remedies; Specific
Performance. (a) Without limiting the right to receive any payment it may be
entitled to receive under Section 8.03(f) (including under Sections 1.07,
5.01, 6.02(a), 6.07(b) and 6.14), the Company agrees that to the extent it
has incurred losses or damages in connection with this Agreement the maximum
aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor for such losses or
damages shall be limited to the Parent Termination Fee, and in no event shall
the Company seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount from
Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor or their respective Representatives and
affiliates in connection therewith.   (b) The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed by the Company in accordance with the terms hereof and
that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01,
Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. The parties
acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that
the Company\'s sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach
shall be the remedy set forth in Section 9.08(a) and 8.03(f); provided,
however, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance
to prevent any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of Sections 6.02(b) and
6.07(c).   SECTION 9.09 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that
State. All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The
parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery for the purpose of any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably
waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in
any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of the above-named court, that its property is exempt or immune
from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or
the Transactions may not be enforced in or by the above-named court.  
SECTION 9.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each
of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party    55    would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties
hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions,
as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this Section 9.10.   SECTION 9.11 Headings. The descriptive headings
contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.   SECTION 9.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.   
56       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above
by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.   BOCA RESORTS,
