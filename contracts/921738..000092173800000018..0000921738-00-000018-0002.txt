AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this
"Agreement"), dated as of July 31, 2000, is made and entered into by and
among CRC HOLDINGS, INC., a Florida corporation (the "Company"), PENN
NATIONAL GAMING, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Parent"), CASINO
HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), and SHERWOOD WEISER
and DONALD E. LEFTON (individually, a "Shareholder" and collectively, the
"Shareholders").   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the respective Boards
of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and Penn National Holding
Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Holding"), the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, have each approved this
Agreement and the business combination described herein in which the Company
will become a subsidiary of Parent as a result of a merger of Merger Sub with
and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter
set forth (the "Merger"), pursuant to which each outstanding share of common
stock, par value $.005 per share ("Company Common Stock"), of the Company
will be converted into the right to receive cash in the manner set forth
herein; and   WHEREAS, prior to the Merger, the Company will distribute
the Divestiture Entities (as such term is defined in Section 4.1 hereof) so
that the remaining assets and liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries
remaining shall be those relating to their gaming business (the "Gaming
Business"); and   WHEREAS, Parent is willing to enter into this Agreement
only on the conditions that the Shareholders agree to indemnify Parent in the
manner herein provided and that each Shareholder enters into the non-
disclosure and non-solicitation covenants contained herein;   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and conditions set forth below, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:  1. THE
MERGER  1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in
accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act (the "FBCA") and the
Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), at the Effective Time (hereinafter
defined): (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, (b) the Company, as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), (i) shall
be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, (ii) shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Florida, (iii) shall retain its
present name and (iv) shall succeed to all   rights, assets, liabilities
and obligations of Merger Sub and the Company in accordance with the FBCA;
(c) the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall continue as the Articles of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation; (d) the Bylaws of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall continue as the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation; (e) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation; and
(f) the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation. Nothing in Sections
1.1 (c) and (e) shall preclude amendment of the Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws after the Effective Time in accordance with the terms thereof and
applicable law. Nothing in Sections 1.1(e) and (f) shall preclude the
election or appointment of new or additional directors and officers
as provided for in the Company\'s Bylaws. From and after the Effective Time,
the Merger will have all the effects provided by applicable law.  1.2
Shareholder Meeting, Closing, Effective Time of the Merger. The Company shall
submit this Agreement and the Merger to the holders of Company Common Stock
for approval and adoption at the Shareholders Meeting (hereinafter defined)
to be held as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 4.3 hereof. Subject to the Merger receiving
the requisite shareholder approval and subject to the other provisions of
this Agreement, the parties shall hold a closing (the "Closing") within 30
days after all of the Consents (hereinafter defined) have been obtained (the
"Closing Date"), at 9:00 a.m. at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP,
5300 First Union Financial Center, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Miami,
Florida 33131-2339, or at such other time or place as Parent and the Company
agree upon. Within two business days after the Closing Date, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger
(the "Articles of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Florida in such form as required by the FBCA and a Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by the DGCL
(the date and time of the later of such filings, or such later date or time
agreed upon by Parent and the Company and set forth therein, the "Effective
Time").  1.3 Conversion and Cancellation of Securities.  (a) The "Total
Purchase Price" shall be $95,750,000; provided and only in the event that the
consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
of the Gaming Business, for the twelve months ended on the Closing Date, as
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, consistently applied ("Latest 12 months EBITDA"), is at least
$30,335,000, then the Total Purchase Price shall be $97,000,000. For purposes
of the Closing, the Latest 12 Months EBITDA shall be estimated by the parties
in good faith as above or below $30,335,000, and such estimate shall be
subject to verification pursuant to Section 1.7. Further, the parties agree
that the Total Purchase Price may be reduced pursuant to Section 5.3(k)
hereof.   (b) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into, and become exchangeable for, the right to receive the "Cash
Consideration."  (c) The "Cash Consideration" shall equal the Total Purchase
Price, less the Option Amount (hereinafter defined), divided by the sum of
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the
Effective Time.  (d) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common
Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect subsidiary
of Parent and each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Company or any
direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company (collectively, "Excluded Common
Shares"), shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be automatically canceled and retired and cease to exist,
and no cash, securities or other property shall be payable in respect
thereof.  (e) At the Effective Time, each share of Merger Sub common stock,
par value $.01 per share ("Merger Sub Common Stock"), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action by the holder thereof, be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, par value $.005 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common Stock").  1.4
Exchange of Certificates.  (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall
select a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent") in connection with the surrender of certificates evidencing shares of
Company Common Stock converted into Cash Consideration pursuant to the
Merger. At and following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent an amount of cash representing the Total Purchase Price less
the Closing Escrow Amount.  (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person who was,
at the Effective Time, a holder of record of a certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, which shall be in a form and contain any other provisions as
Parent and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably agree and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Cash Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed
and duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Cash Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the terms hereof, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. If any portion of the Cash
Consideration is to   be paid to a person other than the person who is the
record holder of the Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, it shall be
a condition to such payment that the certificate evidencing the Company
Common Stock so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that it be accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Surviving Corporation or Parent that any applicable stock transfer tax
has been paid.  (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the constituent
corporations, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
exchange of Certificates for shares of Merger Stock. Any Cash Consideration
not exchanged pursuant to Section 1.4(b) hereof for Company Common Stock
within six months after the Effective Time shall be returned by the Exchange
Agent to the Surviving Corporation, which shall thereafter act as exchange
agent subject to the rights of holders of Company Common Stock
hereunder.  (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereafter be made.  (e) If any Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates the Cash Consideration for the shares represented thereby,
deliverable in respect thereof, as determined in accordance with the terms
hereof. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, the person to whom the Cash Consideration is to be
issued, as a condition precedent to such delivery, shall give Parent an
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.  (f) No
holder of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to any interest on the  Cash
Consideration.  1.5 Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option
to purchase shares of Common Stock shall be canceled and each holder of such
an option shall be paid an amount equal to the Option Value less the
aggregate exercise price of such option. The "Option Amount" shall mean the
aggregate amount of such payments. The "Option Value" shall mean the Total
Purchase Price divided by the sum of total number, at the Effective Time, of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options.  1.6
Dissenter or Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Company Common Stock with
respect to which dissenters\' rights are duly exercised in accordance with
Section 607.1320 of the FBCA ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be entitled to
receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof, unless such
holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or loses his right to dissent
from the Merger under Section 607.1320. Such holder shall be entitled to
receive only the payment provided for by Section 607.1320. If any such holder
so fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or loses his dissenters\' rights,
his Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3
hereof.   1.7 Preclosing Distributions. Up and until the Closing, Louisiana
Casinos Cruises, Incorporated, a Louisiana corporation ("LCCI"), may
distribute to its shareholders, including the Company, an amount equal to its
net after-tax income as determined in accordance with GAAP for the period
from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, but not to exceed
the amount permitted by law or regulation, or permitted by any indenture,
loan agreement or other agreement applicable to LCCI in the form thereof as
of the date of this Agreement. Immediately prior to Closing, the Company may
transfer to its shareholders by way of distribution or redemption, at the
election of the Company, (i) the Divestiture Entities (as defined herein) and
(ii) an amount equal to its net after-tax income (the "Interim Income") for
the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date (but
excluding, in calculating net income for purposes of this sentence, all net
income attributable to, or consolidated from, LCCI), plus any amount received
by the Company in the distribution referred to in the preceding sentence,
less the aggregate amount of Special Payments, but not to exceed the amount
permitted by law or regulation, or permitted by any indenture, loan agreement
or other agreement applicable to the Company in the form thereof as of the
date of this Agreement. In the event the aggregate amount of Special Payments
exceeds the Interim Income, the Total Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
amount of such excess. "Special Payments" shall mean (i) bonus and
discretionary payments made to Robert B. Sturges and W. Peter Temling, (ii)
amounts paid to employees in consideration of their waiver of change in
control payments, (iii) the aggregate amount of severance payments which will
be payable to employees of the Divestiture Entities as a result of their
termination as employees of the Company and Subsidiaries and (iv)
the Company\'s legal fees and expenses of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Within 60 days after the Closing Date, at the request of the
Company or the Shareholders, Parent\'s independent accountants shall review
the determination of Interim Income and/or the estimate of Latest 12 Months
EBITDA. In the event the accountants determine that (i) the Interim Income
was greater than the amount thereof determined prior to Closing or (ii) the
Latest 12 Months EBITDA, having been estimated for purposes of the Closing at
less than $30,335,000, is at least $30,335,000, the Company shall pay pro
rata to the shareholders who received distributions or cash consideration, as
applicable, the balance in excess of the amount previously distributed and/or
the additional $1,250,000 payable under Section 1.3(a), as applicable. In the
event the accountants determine that (i) the Interim Income was less than the
amount distributed or (ii) the Latest 12 Months EBITDA, having been estimated
for purposes of the Closing to be at least $30,335,000, is less than
$30,335,000, the distributions in excess of Interim Income and/or the
additional $1,250,000 paid under Section 1.3(a), as applicable, shall be
returned to the Company by a payment from the Shareholders. The Shareholders
shall be jointly and severally liable for such repayment. In the event that
either Parent or the Shareholders do not agree with the accountants\'
determination, then either may submit the accountants\' determination for
final determination by an arbitrator who is to be appointed and to act in
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The
decision of the arbitrator shall be deemed to be the accountants\'
determination for purposes of this Section 1.7 and shall be final and binding
upon the parties. The right to submit the determination to arbitration must
be exercised within 10 days of receipt of the
accountants\' determination.   1.8 Deposit Escrow.  (a) Within two
business days of the date hereof, Parent shall deliver $4,400,000 (the
"Deposit") to Republic Security Bank as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") to
be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth
in the Deposit Escrow Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Deposit
Escrow Agreement"). The Deposit and the accrued interest thereon shall be
applied as part of the Cash Consideration and credited to the Total Purchase
Price if the Closing occurs. If Closing has not occurred on or prior to 9
months from the date of this Agreement (the "Non-Discretionary Date"), the
Parent shall make a payment of $1,700,000 to the Company (the "Non-
Discretionary Payment"). If the Closing occurs, the Non-Discretionary Payment
shall be applied as part of the Cash Consideration and credited to the Total
Purchase Price. Absent any breach by the Company or the Shareholders of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, the terms
of Section 1.8(b) below will not apply to the Non-Discretionary Payment. If
the Closing does not occur by reason of a breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant in this Agreement by the Company or any Shareholder, the
Non-Discretionary Payment shall be refunded to the Parent. If the Closing
does not occur for any other reason (except as provided in the next paragraph
of this Section 1.8(a)), the Non-Discretionary Payment and the accrued
interest thereon shall be retained by the Company. If the Closing has not
occurred on or prior to 12 months from the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall have the option, but not the obligation, to extend the time for Closing
an additional 3 months by Parent making an additional payment of $1,700,000
to the Escrow Agent (the "Discretionary Payment"). Such Discretionary Payment
and the accrued interest thereon shall become part of the Deposit and if the
Closing occurs shall be applied as part of the Cash Consideration and
credited to the Total Purchase Price.   The Louisiana Gaming Control Board
issued a Report on Conditional License Renewal on or about July 24, 2000
captioned "In Re: Louisiana Casino Cruises, Inc. d/b/a Casino Rouge License
No. R011700193" (the "Report"). The Report refers to proposed conditions to
renewal of LCCI\'s license. Such conditions and any additional conditions
subsequently imposed by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board are referred to
herein as "Conditions." Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, in the event
that a Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Non-Discretionary Date and
as of such date (i) LCCI has not been issued a license renewal and Casino
Rouge is not continuing to operate in the manner operated as of the date
hereof or (ii) Parent has not been issued a gaming license in Louisiana, in
either case as a result of a failure to satisfy any of the Conditions, then
the Non-Discretionary Payment shall not be payable. In such event, (i) the
time for Closing shall be extended to six months after the Non-Discretionary
Date without Parent being obligated to make the Discretionary Payment and
(ii) the Non-Discretionary Payment shall only become payable if a Closing has
not occurred 30 days after all Conditions have been satisfied and such
renewal license issued or Casino Rouge is continuing to operate in the manner
operated as of the date hereof. In the event such Conditions have not been
satisfied and such licenses issued six months after the Non-Discretionary
Date, then, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.8(b) hereof, the
Deposit plus accrued interest shall be refunded to Parent and this Agreement
shall terminate.   (b) In the event that the Closing does not occur for any
reason prior to termination of this Agreement, the Deposit plus accrued
interest thereon shall be refundable to Parent, unless the Closing does not
occur as a result of:  (i) Parent\'s failure to obtain the financing
contemplated by Section 4.10  herein,  (ii) a material breach by Parent of
any of its representations or warranties  under this Agreement,  (iii)a
material breach by Parent of any of its covenants under this Agreement, 
or   (iv) the failure of a Gaming Authority (as defined in Section 2.7) to
grant  to Parent, its Affiliates and Licensed Persons all approvals and
licenses  necessary for Parent to consummate the Agreement for any reason,
except  that this clause (iv) will not apply if such failure to grant such 
approvals and licenses is:  (A) solely as a result of a Gaming Authority\'s
imposition of any requirement  that would have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 2 below)  following the Closing Date, or  (B) solely as
a result of a Gaming Authority\'s failure to take any action with  respect to
Parent\'s application for such approvals and licenses necessary  to
consummate the Agreement (provided the Parent is using its reasonable 
efforts to diligently pursue all such approvals and licenses, has not 
withdrawn its application to the Gaming Authority or taken any action which 
would otherwise preclude or prevent the Gaming Authority from taking such 
action with respect to Parent\'s application).    And if clause (i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv) applies, the Deposit and accrued  interest thereon shall be
paid to the Company, and if the Deposit is  payable to the Company, $3.5
million of the Deposit will be applied as  payment for the technical services
provided by the Company under Section  4.11 of this Agreement. In all other
events, the Deposit plus accrued  interest thereon shall be released by the
Escrow Agent to Parent  immediately upon Parent\'s written demand.  (c) The
Company and Shareholders agree that, if Closing does not occur for any 
reason, the sole extent of their recoverable damages are the liquidated 
damages provided for in this Section 1.8.  2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF THE COMPANY AND THE SHAREHOLDERS   As used in this Agreement, "Material
Adverse Effect" shall mean a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, operating results, business (including the ability to obtain or
maintain gaming licenses or registrations) or prospects of the Company and
the Subsidiaries (hereinafter defined) taken as a whole; provided, however,
that neither of the following shall be deemed to result in a Material Adverse
Effect: (i) the adoption of legislation in Louisiana further regulating or
taxing the gaming industry or (ii) competition resulting from new gaming
venues in Ontario listed on Exhibit B (such proviso referred to as the
"Exceptions").   The Company and the Shareholders hereby represent and
warrant to, and agree with, Parent and Merger Sub as follows, except as set
forth on a Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company Schedule"), each of
which exceptions shall specifically identify the relevant subsection hereof
to which it relates and shall be deemed to be representations and warranties
as if made hereunder:  2.1 Organization, Powers and Qualifications. The
Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it has
been and is now being conducted and to own, lease, manage and operate the
properties and assets used in connection therewith. The Company is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation authorized to do business and is in good
standing in every jurisdiction in which such qualification is required,
all of which jurisdictions are disclosed in the Company Schedule, except
where failure to be so authorized (other than in Louisiana or Ontario) would
not result in a Material Adverse Effect.  2.2 Subsidiaries.  (a) As used
in this Article 2 and elsewhere in this Agreement, unless otherwise stated,
"Subsidiary" and "Subsidiaries" mean, either jointly or severally, as the
case may be, the entities other than the Company which are Retained
Entities (as defined herein in Section 4.1).   (b) The Company Schedule
lists each Subsidiary, the jurisdiction of its organization and the amount of
its securities outstanding and the owners thereof. Each Subsidiary is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization. Each Subsidiary has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as it has been and is now being conducted
and to own, lease and operate the assets and properties used in connection
therewith. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified as a foreign corporation
authorized to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in
which such qualification is required, all of which jurisdictions are
disclosed on the Company Schedule, except where failure to be so
authorized (other than in Louisiana or Ontario) would not result in a
Material Adverse Effect. All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock
of each Subsidiary have been duly authorized, are validly issued and
outstanding, are fully paid and nonassessable and were issued in compliance
with all applicable federal and state securities laws, and, except as set
forth on the Company Schedule, are lawfully owned of record and beneficially
by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of all material pledges,
liens, claims, security interests and other charges or defects in title of
any nature whatsoever ("Liens"). There are no existing subscriptions,
options, warrants, convertible securities, calls, commitments, agreements,
conversion rights or other rights of any character (contingent or otherwise)
calling for or requiring the issuance, transfer, sale or other disposition of
any shares of the capital stock of any Subsidiary, or calling for or
requiring the issuance of any securities or rights convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary, nor is
the Company or any Subsidiary subject to any obligation (contingent or
otherwise) to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire shares of capital stock
of any Subsidiary, in any case except as set forth on the Company Schedule.
Except for the Subsidiaries or as set forth in the Company Schedule, neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary directly or indirectly (i) owns or controls

as described in the Company Schedule, since November 30, 1999 (the "Audit
Date"), the Company and the Subsidiaries have conducted their business solely
in the ordinary course consistent with past practice. Except as otherwise
disclosed on the Company Schedule, since the Audit Date, the Company and the

hereby;  (b) made any material change to their respective accounting
methods, principles  or practices;  (c) been subject to any revaluation of
any assets of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries;  (d) incurred any

discharge has caused or will cause any material damage or risk of material
loss to it or any of its material assets or properties; or   (e) taken or
been subject to any other action or event that would have required the
consent of Parent pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof.  2.10 Indebtedness;
Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. The Company Schedule discloses as of the
date hereof all indebtedness for money borrowed of the Company or any
Subsidiary, accurately disclosing for each such indebtedness the payee, the
original principal amount of the loan, the current unpaid balance of the
loan, the interest rate and the maturity date. Neither the Company nor
the Subsidiaries have any material indebtedness, liability or obligation of
any kind (whether known or unknown, accrued, absolute, asserted or
unasserted, contingent or otherwise) except (i) as and to the extent
reflected, reserved against or otherwise disclosed in the Company 1999
Balance Sheet, or (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred subsequent to
the Audit Date in the ordinary course of business which would not impair the
ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement and
which would not prevent or delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.  2.11 Assets. Except as described in the Company
Schedule, the Company and the Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to
all their real and personal properties and assets, including, without
limitation, those assets and properties reflected in the Company 1999 Balance
Sheet in the amounts and categories reflected therein, free and clear of all
Liens, except (a) the lien of current taxes not yet due and payable, (b)
properties, interests, and assets disposed of by the Company or any
Subsidiary since the Balance Sheet Date solely in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (c) such secured indebtedness as is

to therein, and (d) such imperfections of title, easements and encumbrances,
if any, as are not substantial in character, amount or extent and do not
materially detract from the value, or interfere with the present or proposed
use, of the properties subject thereto ("Permitted Liens"). All buildings,
structures, facilities, equipment and other items of tangible personal
property reflected on the Company 1999 Balance Sheet or acquired since the
Audit Date are in satisfactory operating condition and repair, subject
to normal wear and maintenance, are useable in the regular and ordinary
course of business of the Company and the Subsidiaries and conform to all
applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, codes, rules and regulations and
Authorizations (hereinafter defined) relating to their construction, use and
operation in all material respects. The method of amortization or
depreciation used by the Company for financial reporting purposes is
sufficient to write-off entirely each building, structure, facility and item
of equipment or other tangible personal property during its useful
life.  2.12 Contracts.  (a) The Company Schedule lists each written or
oral contract, agreement, arrangement, lease, instrument, mortgage or
commitment to which the Company or a Subsidiary is a party or may be bound or
to which their respective properties or assets may be subject ("Contract")

present or former employee or for the   employment of any person or
consultant or which is a non-compete arrangement with any employee of the
Company or a Subsidiary; (iii) which is a severance agreement, program or

represents any confidentiality or non-disclosure arrangement pursuant to

or in any way is or will be liable with respect to material obligations of
any other person.  (b) All Contracts are valid and binding and in full force
and effect as to the Company on the date of this Agreement in all material
respects. None of the Company, the Subsidiaries nor, to the Company\'s
knowledge, any other parties, have violated any provision of, or committed or
failed to perform any act which with notice, lapse of time or both would
constitute a material default or a basis of terminating under the provisions
of, any Contract. True and complete copies of all Contracts listed on the
Company Schedule, together with all amendments thereto through the date
hereof, have been delivered to Parent. The Contracts are unamended except as
set forth in the Company Schedule. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
waived any rights under any Contract.  2.13 Insurance. The Company Schedule
accurately sets forth as of the date hereof all policies of insurance, other
than title insurance policies, held by or on behalf of the Company and the
Subsidiaries and all outstanding or threatened claims thereunder in excess,
individually or in the aggregate, of $50,000. All such policies of insurance
are in full force and effect, and no notice of cancellation has been
received. In the reasonable judgment of the Company, such policies are in
amounts which are adequate in relation to the business and properties of the
Company, and all premiums to date have been paid in full.  2.14
Authorizations; Compliance With Law.  (a) The Company and the Subsidiaries
hold all licenses, franchises, registrations, certificates, consents,
permits, approvals, certificates of public convenience and necessity, and
authorizations ("Authorizations") from all Governmental Entities and other
persons (including, without limitation, all required Authorizations which may
be issued or required by the Gaming Authorities) which are necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective     businesses and their use and
occupancy of their assets and properties in the manner heretofore conducted,
used and occupied, except where failure to do so would not result in a
Material Adverse Effect. A complete and correct list of the material
Authorizations held by the Company or a Subsidiary is set forth in the
Company Schedule. True and complete copies of all Authorizations listed
on the Company Schedule, together with all amendments thereto through the
date hereof, have been delivered to Parent. All of such Authorizations are
valid, in good standing and in full force and effect and the Company and the
Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of their
respective obligations under such Authorizations. To the Company\'s and the
Shareholders\' knowledge, no event has occurred with respect to the material
Authorizations which permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both would
permit, revocation or termination thereof or would result in any other
material impairment of the rights of the holder of any of the Authorizations,
and no terminations or revocations thereof have been, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened.  (b) The Company, the Subsidiaries and each of their
respective directors, officers and gaming managers are in compliance with the
terms of the Authorizations issued by the Gaming Authorities. No
investigation or review by any Gaming Authority with respect to the Company
or any Subsidiary is pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company,
threatened, nor has any Gaming Authority indicated an intention to conduct
the same. Except as disclosed in the Company Schedule, to the best knowledge
of the Company, neither the Company, the Subsidiaries nor any director,
officer or gaming manager of the Company or the Subsidiaries has received any
written claim, demand, notice, complaint, court order or administrative order
from any Governmental Entity in the past three years, asserting that a
license or registration of it or them, as applicable, issued by any Gaming
Authority, should be revoked or suspended. Neither the Company, the
Subsidiaries nor any of the Shareholders knows of any facts which, if known
to any of the Gaming Authorities, could reasonably be expected to result in
the revocation or suspension of an Authorization, or of any officer, director
or gaming manager, or would be reasonably expected to disqualify the Company
from any Authorization.  (c) The Company and each of the Subsidiaries is in
material compliance with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, codes,
rules and regulations of any Governmental Entities, and neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary has received any notice from a Governmental Entity within
five years of the date hereof of any such violation which would result in a
Material Adverse Effect.  2.15 Taxes.  "Taxes" shall mean any federal,
state, provincial, municipal, territorial, local or foreign taxes,
assessments, deficiencies, levies, imposts, customs duties, fees and other

or any foreign country or jurisdiction or any province, municipality,
territory or other political subdivision thereof. All federal, state,
provincial, municipal, territorial, local and foreign tax returns,
declarations, remittances, information returns, reports, statements and other
similar filings and documents of every nature required to be filed by or on
behalf of the Company or the Subsidiaries in respect of any Taxes or in
respect of any other provision in any domestic or foreign federal, state,
provincial, municipal, territorial, local or other taxing statute (the "Tax
Returns") on or prior to the date hereof or with respect to taxable or fiscal
periods ending on or prior to the date hereof with respect to any Taxes have
been timely filed with the appropriate governmental agencies in all
jurisdictions in which such Tax Returns are required to be filed, any other
Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or a Subsidiary in respect of
any taxable or fiscal period ending on or before the Effective Time will be
timely filed with the appropriate governmental agencies in all jurisdictions
in which such Tax Returns are required to be filed, any other Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company or a Subsidiary in respect of any taxable
or fiscal period ending on or before the Effective Time will be timely filed
with the appropriate governmental agencies in all jurisdictions in which such

Section 9.1, and all such Tax Returns correctly reflect the liabilities of
the Company and the Subsidiaries for Taxes for the periods, property or
events covered thereby, are complete in all material respects, and no
material fact has been omitted therefrom. Copies of all Tax Returns for the
fiscal year ended November 30, 1999, will be filed and will be provided by
the Company or the Subsidiaries to Parent by August 15, 2000. Except as
disclosed in the Company Schedule, no extension of time in which to file any
Tax Return is in effect. The Company has provided or made available all Tax
Returns for the five preceding fiscal years.  (a) Except as disclosed in the
Company Schedule, all Taxes in respect of all taxable or fiscal periods
ending on or prior to the Effective Time, including those without limitation
which are called for by the Tax Returns or by any assessments or
reassessments in respect of the Tax Returns, have been fully paid or properly
accrued in accordance with United States or Canadian generally accepted
accounting principles, as the case may be, in financial statements of the
Company or any Subsidiary delivered to Parent on or before the Closing
Date. No other Taxes in respect of any taxable or fiscal period ending on or
prior to the Effective Time are or will be payable by the Company or any
Subsidiary. The accruals for Taxes contained in the Company 1999 Balance
Sheet are adequate to cover the tax liabilities of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the Audit Date and include adequate provision for all
deferred taxes, and nothing has occurred subsequent to that date to make any
of such accruals inadequate.   (b) Except as disclosed in the Company
Schedule, neither the Company nor the Subsidiaries have received any notice
or indication of an assessment or reassessment or proposed assessment or
reassessment in connection with any Taxes or Tax Returns, regardless of its
merits, and there are no pending tax examinations of or tax claims asserted
against the Company or the Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or
properties. Except as disclosed in the Company Schedule, there are no
outstanding issues which have been raised and communicated to the Company or
the Subsidiaries by any governmental agency for any taxation year or period

challenged or disputed the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of Taxes or
of any Tax Returns. The Company is not negotiating any draft assessment or
reassessment with any governmental agency. There are no outstanding issues
which have been raised and communicated to the Company or the Subsidiaries by
any governmental agency for any taxation year or period in respect of which a

Subsidiary in respect of Taxes or of any Tax Returns which remains
unresolved. The Company is not negotiating any draft assessment
or reassessment with any governmental agency. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has extended, or waived the application of, any statute
of limitations or time period of any jurisdiction regarding the
assessment, reassessment or collection of any Taxes.  (c) There are no tax
liens (other than any lien for current taxes not yet due and payable) on any
of the assets or properties of the Company or the Subsidiaries. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary nor any Shareholder has any knowledge of any basis
for any additional assessment or reassessment of any Taxes or of any
contingent liabilities for Taxes, including, without limitation, unreported
benefits conferred on any shareholder of the Company or a Subsidiary. All
taxation years up to and including the taxation year listed on the
Company Schedule are considered closed by Canadian federal and provincial
governmental agencies for the purpose of all Taxes. The Company and the
Subsidiaries have made all deposits required by law to be made with respect
to employees\' withholding and other employment taxes, including, without
limitation, the portion of such deposits relating to Taxes imposed upon the
Company or the Subsidiaries.  (d) The Company and the Subsidiaries have
withheld from each payment made to any of their present or former employees,
officers and directors, and to all persons who are non-residents of Canada
for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada), all amounts required by law
to be withheld, and furthermore, have remitted such withheld amounts within
the prescribed periods to the appropriate governmental agency, except where
there would be no Material Adverse Effect from the failure to withhold. The
Company and the Subsidiaries have remitted all Canada Pension   Plan
contributions, provincial pension plan contributions, unemployment
and employment insurance premiums, employer health taxes and other Taxes
payable by them in respect of their employees and have remitted such amounts
to the proper governmental agency within the time required under the

collected and remitted on a timely basis all Taxes as required under
applicable legislation on any sale, supply or delivery whatsoever, made by

which could result in the application of section 78 of the Income Tax Act
(Canada) or any equivalent provincial provision to the Company or any
Subsidiary.  (f) At Closing, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act
(Canada), the Subsidiaries chartered or incorporated in Canada or any
province thereof (the "Canada Subsidiaries") will own depreciable property of
the prescribed classes and having undepreciated capital costs as set out in
the Company Schedule.  (g) The Company and the Subsidiaries will not at any
time be deemed to have a capital gain pursuant to subsection 80.03(2) of the
Income Tax Act (Canada) as a result of any transaction or event taking place
in any taxable or fiscal period ending on or before Closing.  (h) Any Taxes
that arise from the distribution or spin-off by the Company of
the Divestiture Entities, as provided in Section 4.1, shall be the
sole responsibility of the Shareholders.  2.16 Absence of Litigation;
Claims. Except as described on the Company Schedule, there are no claims,
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any properties or rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with
respect to which any director, officer, employee or agent is or may be
entitled to claim indemnification from the Company or any Subsidiary, before
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator, which, if decided adversely to the
Company or such Subsidiary, would result in a loss in excess of $50,000 or
impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or prevent or delay the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor is there any judgement, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
outstanding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having or which,
insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future would have such
effect.  2.17 Employee Benefit Plans; Employment Agreements.  (a) The

reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries; (iii) all Employee Plans are in compliance in all
material respects with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes

any excise, income or other taxes or penalties with respect to any Employee
Plan, and no event has occurred and no circumstance exists that may
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such liability; (ix) there are no
pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened claims against any
Employee Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) or against any
fiduciary or an Employee Plan with respect to such plan, nor is there any
basis for such a claim; and (x) no Employee Plan is presently under audit or
examination (nor has notice been received of a potential audit
or examination) by any governmental entity, and no matters are pending with
respect to any Employee Plan under any governmental corrective or remedial
program.  (c) The Company Schedule sets forth all of the employee benefit,
health, welfare, supplemental unemployment benefit, bonus, pension, profit
sharing, deferred compensation, stock compensation, stock purchase,
retirement, hospitalization insurance, medical, dental, legal, disability and
similar plans or arrangements or practices relating to the employees employed
by the Canadian Subsidiaries (the "Canadian Benefit Plans"), excluding former
plans, arrangements or practices under the Canadian Benefit Plans under which
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability. No material changes
have occurred to the Canadian Benefit Plans or, excluding changes in interest
rates or investment returns, are expected to occur which would affect the
actuarial reports or financial statements required to be provided to Parent
pursuant to this Section 2.17.  (d) All of the Canadian Benefit Plans are
and have been established, registered, qualified, invested and administered,
in all respects, in accordance with all laws, regulations, orders or other
legislative, administrative or judicial promulgations application to the
Canadian Benefit Plans ("Applicable Benefit Laws") and in accordance with all
understandings, written or oral, between (i) the Company and/or the Canadian
Subsidiaries and (ii) the employees of the Company and/or the employees of
the Subsidiaries. No fact or circumstance exists that could adversely affect
the tax-exempt status of any Canadian Benefit Plan which enjoys such
status.  (e) All obligations of the Company and the Canadian Subsidiaries
regarding the Canadian Benefit Plans have been satisfied, there are no
outstanding defaults or violations by any party thereto and no taxes,
penalties or fees are owing or exigible under any of the Canadian Benefit
Plans by the Company or any Canadian Subsidiary. The Company or a Canadian
Subsidiary may unilaterally amend, modify, vary or terminate, in whole or in
part, each Canadian Benefit Plan and take contribution holidays under or
withdraw surplus from each Canadian Benefit Plan, subject only to approvals
required by, and restrictions imposed by, Applicable Benefit Laws.   (f)
No Canadian Benefit Plan, nor any related trust or other funding
medium thereunder, is subject to any pending investigation, examination or
other proceeding, action or claim initiated by any governmental agency
or instrumentality, or by any other entity (other than routine claims
for benefits). Further, should any matter arise which could affect the
registration of any of the Canadian Benefit Plans, the Company or a Canadian
Subsidiary will, in a timely fashion, take all steps required to ensure such
registration is not affected.  (g) All contributions or premiums required
to be made by the Company and/or the Canadian Subsidiaries under the terms of
each Canadian Benefit Plan or by Applicable Benefit Laws have been made in a
timely fashion in accordance with Applicable Benefit Laws and the terms of
the Canadian Benefit Plans, and neither the Company nor any Canadian
Subsidiary has, and as of Closing will not have, any liability (other than
liabilities accruing after the Closing Date) with respect to any of the
Canadian Benefit Plans which would have a Material Adverse Effect.  (h) No
material amendments have been made to any Canadian Benefit Plan and
no improvements to any Canadian Benefit Plan have been promised and no
amendments or improvements to a Canadian Benefit Plan will be made or
promised prior to the Closing Date. There have been no improper withdrawals,
applications or transfers of assets from any Canadian Benefit Plan or the
trusts or other funding media relating thereto, and none of the Company, any
Canadian Subsidiary, nor any of their agents has been in breach which would
have a Material Adverse Effect of any fiduciary obligation with respect to
the administration of the Canadian Benefit Plans or the trusts or other
funding media relating thereto which would have a Material Adverse
Effect.  (i) CRC has furnished to Parent true, correct and complete copies
of all the Canadian Benefit Plans as amended as of the date hereof together

funding agreements, actuarial reports, funding and financial information
returns and statements, all professional opinions (whether or not internally
prepared) with respect to each Canadian Benefit Plan, all material internal
memoranda concerning the Canadian Benefit Plans, copies of material
correspondence with all regulatory authorities with respect to each Canadian
Benefit Plan and plan summaries, booklets and personnel manuals.  (j) Each
Canadian Benefit Plan is fully funded or is fully insured on both an ongoing
and solvency basis pursuant to the actuarial assumptions in the
Company Schedule. None of the Canadian Benefit Plans enjoys any special tax
status under the Income Tax Act (Canada) or under other applicable
legislation, nor have any advance tax rulings been sought or received in
respect of the Canadian Benefit Plans. All employee data necessary to
administer each Canadian Benefit Plan has been provided by CRC to Parent and
is true and correct as of the date hereof, and CRC will notify Parent of any
changes thereto occurring prior to the Closing Date. No insurance policy or
any other contract or agreement affecting any Canadian Benefit Plan requires
or permits any material retroactive increase in premiums or payments due
thereunder.   (k) Except as disclosed in the Company Schedule, none of the
Canadian Benefit Plans provide benefits to retired employees or to the
beneficiaries or dependents of retired employees.  (l) The Company Schedule
sets forth a true and complete list of each current or former employee,
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who holds any
option to purchase Company Common Stock as of the date hereof, together with
the number of shares of Company Common Stock which are subject to such
option, the date of grant of such option, the extent to which such option is
vested (or will become vested within six months on or after the date
hereof, or as a result of, the Merger), the option price of such option (to
the extent determined as of the date hereof), whether such option is intended
to qualify as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422(b)
of the Code (an "ISO"), and the expiration date of such option. The Company
Schedule also sets forth the total number of such ISOs and such nonqualified
options.  (m) Any amount that could be received (whether in cash or property
or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of the
Company or any of its affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or Employee Plan currently in effect would not be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of
the Code).  2.18 Labor Matters.  (a) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement or
other labor agreement with any union or labor organization and no union or
labor organization has been recognized by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as an exclusive bargaining representative for employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the Company\'s knowledge, there is no
current union representation question involving employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, nor does the Company have knowledge of
any significant activity or proceeding of any labor organization (or
representative thereof) or employee group to organize any such employees.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any commitment not
in collective bargaining agreements listed on the Company Schedule that would
require the application of the terms of any collective bargaining agreements
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Parent, to any
joint venture of Parent, or to any Subsidiary of Parent (other than the
Company or its Subsidiaries). Except as disclosed on the Company Schedule,
(i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have been and are being operated in
material compliance with all Applicable Laws relating to employees, including
employment standards, occupational health and safety, human rights, labor
relations, workers compensation, pay equity and employment equity, including,
without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA") and the
Family Medical Leave Act except where failure to be in compliance with the
ADA would not result in expense or loss to   the Company or Subsidiaries in
excess of $250,000; (ii) there is no material active arbitration under any
collective bargaining agreement involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) there is no material unfair labor practice, grievance,
employment discrimination or other labor or employment related charge,

before any court, arbitrator, mediator or governmental agency or tribunal,
or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened, (iv) there is no material
strike, picketing or work stoppage by, or any lockout of, employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending, or to the Company\'s
knowledge, threatened, against or involving the Company or any of its

or entity to another, or to consolidate work locations, or involving other
similar restrictions on business operations.  (b) No Employee is on long-
term disability leave, extended absence or receiving benefits pursuant to the
Workplace Safety and Insurance Act (Ontario). Neither the Company nor any of
its Canadian Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any statutorily required
re-employment of any Employee. All current assessments under the Workplace
Safety and Insurance Act (Ontario) in relation to the Company and its
Canadian Subsidiaries have been paid or accrued and neither the Company nor
any of its Canadian Subsidiaries have been subject to any special or penalty
assessment under such legislation which has not been paid.  2.19

of the Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws
and neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any written

Governmental Entity that alleges that the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
is not, in all material respects, in compliance with applicable Environmental
Laws except as set forth on the Company Schedule.  (b) The Company and each

events,    conditions, circumstances, activities, practices, incidents,
actions or plans that may interfere with, or prevent, future continued
material compliance on the part of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
with the material Environmental Permits. Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries has knowledge of matters or conditions that would preclude
reissuance or transfer (to the extent transferable) of any material
Environmental Permit, including amendment of such instrument, to Parent or
one of its Subsidiaries where such action is necessary to maintain compliance
with Environmental Laws in all material respects.  (c) There is no material
Environmental Claim (as defined below) pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened (i) against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, (ii)
against any person or entity whose liability for any Environmental Claim the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either

Environmental Claim the Company or any of the Subsidiaries has or may have
retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law.  (e)

operated by the Company, the Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any predecessor thereof are now or were in the past, listed on the

representatives reasonable access, during regular business hours upon
reasonable notice, to all offices, warehouses and other facilities and to all
of its books and records, (b) permit Parent to make such reasonable
inspections as it may require, and (c) cause its officers and those of its
Subsidiaries to furnish Parent with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to the business and properties of the Company,

reasonably request from the officers of the Company and as the Company may
have on hand or be able to produce without hardship.  4.3 Shareholders\'
Meeting; Shareholders\' Agreements.  (a) As promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance
with the FBCA and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting as promptly as
practicable (unless such date shall be delayed due to
circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the parties) to consider and
vote upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and for such other purposes as may be necessary or
desirable or by written consent.  (b) Each of the Shareholders hereby
irrevocably agrees to vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and against approval of any other
recapitalization, merger, business combination, sale of substantial assets or
similar transaction involving the Company (except for the Merger).  (c)
Each Shareholder agrees not to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of
any of the Shareholder\'s shares of Company Common Stock until the earlier
of the Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement.   (d)
Each of the Shareholders agrees to cooperate with Parent and the Company
to seek the Regulatory Approvals and the successful consummation of the
Merger. Each Shareholder hereby agrees not to cause or permit the Company to
take any action that would cause or could reasonably be expected to tend to
cause the conditions of the obligations of the parties to the Merger not to
be true, including, without limitation, taking or causing any action to be
taken that could cause the representations and warranties of the Company not
to be true and complete as of the Closing Date.  (e) Each Shareholder
understands and agrees that the Shareholder\'s covenants and undertakings
contained in this Section 4.3 are uniquely related to the desire of the
parties to consummate the Merger, that the Merger is a unique
business opportunity for Parent and that, although monetary damages may be
available for the breach of such covenants and undertakings, monetary damages
would be an inadequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, each Shareholder agrees
that Parent shall be entitled to obtain specific performance by such
Shareholder of every covenant and undertaking contained in this Section 4.3
to be performed by such Shareholder.  4.4 Public Announcements. No party
hereto shall make any public announcements or otherwise communicate with any
news media with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby without prior consultation with the other parties as to
the timing and contents of any such announcement as may be reasonable under
the circumstances; provided, that nothing contained herein shall prevent any
party from promptly making all filings with Governmental Entities and all
disclosure as may, in its good faith judgment, be required or advisable in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (in which case
the disclosing party shall advise the other party and provide it with a copy
of the proposed disclosure or filing - excepting disclosures or filings made
by Parent officers and directors - prior to making the disclosure or
filing).  4.5 Notification. Each party hereto shall, in the event of, or
promptly after obtaining knowledge of the occurrence or threatened occurrence

Damages from $250,001 and above;  (b) the aggregate amount of the
Shareholders\' liability under this Section 7 shall not exceed the
$5,000,000, except for Damages arising out of breaches of the representations

obligations under this Section 7 shall terminate at the date that is the

this Section 7.2(c), the third anniversary of the Closing  Date, or  (2)
with respect to representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.3  and
2.15 and the indemnification set forth in Section 7.1(a)(ii) or (iii),  on
the date that is six months after the expiration of the longest  applicable
federal, provincial or state statute of limitation (including  extensions
thereof); or  (ii) the final resolution of claims or demands pending as of
the relevant  dates described in clause (i) of this Section 7.2(c) (such
claims  referred to as "Pending Claims").  7.3 Indemnification Procedures.
All claims or demands for indemnification under  this Section 7 ("Claims")
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:  (a) In the event that any
Indemnified Party has a Claim against any party obligated to provide
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof (the "Indemnifying Party")
which does not involve a Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable
promptness notify the Shareholders of such Claim, specifying the nature of
such Claim and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then
feasible (the "Claim Notice"). If the Shareholders do not notify
the Indemnified Party within thirty days after the date of delivery of the
Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such Claim, with a
detailed statement of the basis of such position, the amount of such Claim
shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.
In case an objection is made in writing in accordance with this Section
7.3(a), the Indemnified Party shall respond in a written statement to the
objection within thirty days and, for sixty days thereafter, attempt in good
faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
of such Claims (and, if the parties should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties).   (b)
(i) In the event that any Claim for which the Indemnifying Party would
be liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against an
Indemnified Party by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Shareholders. The Shareholders
shall have thirty days from the date of delivery of the Claim Notice to
notify the Indemnified Party (A) whether the Indemnifying Party disputes
liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to the Third-Party
Claim, and, if so, the basis for such a dispute, and (B) if such party does
not dispute liability, whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires, at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend against the Third-
Party Claim, provided that the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized (but
not obligated) to file any motion, answer or other pleading and to take any
other action which the Indemnified Party shall deem necessary or appropriate
to protect the Indemnified Party\'s interests.  (ii) In the event that the
Shareholders timely notify the Indemnified Party that  the Indemnifying Party
does not dispute the Indemnifying Party\'s obligation  to indemnify with
respect to the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party  shall defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim by  appropriate proceedings,
provided that, unless the Indemnified Party  otherwise agrees in writing, the
Indemnifying Party may not settle any  Third-Party Claim (in whole or in
part) if such settlement does not include  a complete and unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party. If the  Indemnified Party desires to
participate in, but not control, any such  defense or settlement the
Indemnified Party may do so at its sole cost and  expense. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified  Party against a
Third-Party Claim, whether by failure of such party to give  the Indemnified
Party timely notice as provided herein or otherwise, then  the Indemnified
Party, without waiving any rights against such party, may  settle or defend
against such Third-Party Claim in the Indemnified Party\'s  sole discretion
and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from  the Indemnifying
Party the amount of any settlement or judgment and, on an  ongoing basis, all
indemnifiable costs and expenses of the Indemnified  Party with respect
thereto, including interest from the date such costs and  expenses were
incurred.  (iii)If at any time, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified
Party, notice  of which shall be given in writing to the Shareholders, any
Third-Party  Claim seeks material prospective relief which could have an
adverse effect  on any Indemnified Party or the Surviving Corporation or any
subsidiary,  the Indemnified Party shall have the right to control or assume
(as the  case may be) the defense of any such Third-Party Claim and the
amount of  any judgment or settlement and the reasonable costs and expenses
of defense  shall be included as part of the indemnification obligations of
the  Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the Indemnified Party elects to
exercise  such right, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in,  but not control, the defense of such Third-Party Claim at
the sole cost and  expense of the Indemnifying Party.   (c) Nothing herein
shall be deemed to prevent the Indemnified Party from making a Claim, and an
Indemnified Party may make a Claim hereunder, for potential or contingent
Damages provided the Claim Notice sets forth the specific basis for any such
potential or contingent claim or demand to the extent then feasible and the
Indemnified Party has reasonable grounds to believe that such Claim may
be made.  (d) Subject to the provisions of Section 7.2, the Indemnified
Party\'s failure to give reasonably prompt notice as required by this Section
7.3 of any actual, threatened or possible claim or demand which may give rise
to a right of indemnification hereunder shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any liability which the Indemnifying Party may have to the
Indemnified Party unless the failure to give such notice materially and
adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.  (e) The parties will make
appropriate adjustments for any Tax benefits, Tax detriments or insurance
proceeds in determining the amount of any indemnification obligation under
this Section 7, provided that no Indemnified Party shall be obligated to
continue pursuing any payment pursuant to the terms of any insurance
policy.  (f) In the event of a Shareholder\'s failure to pay any amounts due
under this Section 7, Parent and the Company shall have the right to offset
amounts payable to the Shareholder under any of the Consulting Agreements
referred to in Sections 5.3(g) after obtaining a judgment against the Company
with respect to such amounts due.  7.4 Survival of Representations
Warranties and Covenants. All representations, warranties and covenants made
by the Company and the Shareholders in or pursuant to this Agreement or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto shall be deemed to have been made on
the date of this Agreement (except as otherwise provided herein) and, if a
Closing occurs, as of the Closing Date. The representations of the Company
and the Shareholder will survive the Closing and will remain in effect until,
and will expire upon, the termination of the indemnification obligations as
provided in Section 7.2.  7.5 Remedies Cumulative. The remedies set forth in
this Section 7 are cumulative and shall not be construed to restrict or
otherwise affect any other remedies that may be available to the Indemnified
Parties under any other agreement or pursuant to statutory or common
law.  8. NON-DISCLOSURE, NON-SOLICITATION aND NON-COMPETITION COVENANTS

Merger, each Shareholder agrees to each of the following covenants.   8.1

Company and the Retained Subsidiaries in trust and confidence for the Company

circumstances and (ii) be liable for damages incurred by the Company or
Parent as a result of disclosure of any such information by Shareholder
(without the prior written consent of Parent) for any purpose at any time
after the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shareholder may
disclose any such information to the extent such disclosure is compelled by
applicable law or to the extent such information becomes publicly available
other than by unauthorized disclosure by Shareholder.  8.2 Non-
Solicitation. From the date hereof through the third anniversary date after

whether riverboat based, land based or otherwise, located within or on
vessels departing from North America, including Central America, South
America or the Caribbean (the "Business"), whether as partner, director,
employee, agent, consultant or otherwise; provided that each Shareholder may
continue to hold existing positions on the boards of directors of, and equity
