Section 3.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
action on the part of Apex, First Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any of the following securities:

  



  

(i) each Company Preferred Stock Converted Share (other than any Dissenting
Shares), shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the
following: (x) the number of shares of Apex Common Stock equal to the Per
Share Preferred Stock Consideration; (y) an amount in cash equal to the Per
Share Preferred Cash Consideration; and (z) the number of shares of Apex
Common Stock equal to the Per Share Contingent Consideration (if any);

  



  

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Dissenting Shares and Named
Executive Shares which shall be treated in accordance with _Section 3.05_ and
the terms of the Named Executive Equity Agreements respectively) with respect
to which an Election has been made or deemed to be made pursuant to _Section
3.02(c)_  shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the
following: (x) an amount in cash equal to (1) the Per Share Amount, 
_multiplied by_ (2) the applicable Election Percentage, without interest (the
" _Cash Election Consideration_ ") subject to withholding from the Final Cash
Election Consideration payable to each Electing Stockholder such Election
Holder's PIPE Pro Rata Share of the Common Stockholder PIPE Fees; (y) the
number of shares of Apex Common Stock equal to (1) (A) the Per Share Amount,
_multiplied by_ (B) the difference obtained by subtracting the applicable
Election Percentage from one, _divided by_ (2) $10.00 (the " _Stock Election
Consideration_ "); _provided_ that if the Aggregate Cash Election Amount
prior to any adjustment pursuant to this proviso exceeds the Available Company
Common Stock Cash Amount because of the Company Common Stock Cash Cutback,
the applicable Election Percentage used to determine the Cash Election
Consideration and the Stock Election Consideration shall be _multiplied by_
the quotient of (a) the Available Company Common Stock Cash Amount, _divided
by_  (b) the Aggregate Cash Election Amount (the Cash Election Consideration
and Stock Election Consideration following such adjustment (if any) is
referred to as the " _Final Cash Election Consideration_ " and the " _Final
Stock Election Consideration_ "); and (z) the number of shares of Apex Common
Stock equal to the Per Share Contingent Consideration (if any);

  



  

(iii) all shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held in
the treasury of the Company or by Apex shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto;

  



  

(iv) each share of common stock of First Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation;

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(v) each Named Executive Cash-Settled Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to receive (A)
an amount of cash equal to: the product of (1) the number of Named Executive
Cash-Settled Options _multiplied by_ (2) the Per Share Amount, _minus_ (y)
the aggregate exercise price attributable to such Named Executive Cash-
Settled Options (the " _Named Executive Option-Based Cash Merger
Consideration_ "); and (B) the contingent right to receive a number of shares
Contingent Consideration following the Closing in accordance with _Section
3.03_ ; and

  



  

(vi) each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested (other than the Named
Executive Cash-Settled Options and PRC Options), shall be converted into (1)
an option to purchase a number of shares of Apex Common Stock (such option,
an " _Exchanged Option_ ") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole number) of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Company Option
_immediately_ prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of
Apex Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Exchanged Options shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code (to the extent applicable to an Exchanged Option); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the case of any Exchanged Option to which Section 422 of
the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of Apex Common
Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance
with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to
satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, following the Effective Time, each Exchanged Option shall
continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting
and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding former
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the Per Share
Contingent Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock into which such Company Option is exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to _Section 3.03(c)_ in respect of Unvested Exchanged
Options. The PRC Options will not be continued or assumed by the Company, Apex
or the Merger Subs as part of the Mergers. The cancelled PRC Options will be
replaced and substituted for as of the Effective Time with the award of a new
stock option to purchase a number of shares of Apex Common Stock pursuant to
Apex Equity Incentive Plan equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole number) of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such PRC Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange
Ratio, at an exercise price (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
(A) the exercise price per share of such PRC Option prior to the Effective
Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio. The replacement stock options will
be credited with vesting to the same extent as the existing PRC Options being
replaced, and the new replacement awards will be subject to same vesting
schedule and exercisability provisions. In other respects, the terms and
conditions of the replacement stock options will be as set forth in the new
equity incentive plan and form of option agreement. 

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

In no event shall the aggregate amount of consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 3.01(a) _and the Named Executive Equity Agreements exceed the
amount of the Gross Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) In connection with the assumption of the Exchanged Options pursuant to
_Section 3.01(a)_, Apex may assume the Company Option Plan as of the
Effective Time with respect to the Aggregate Option Consideration. Prior to
the Effective Time, Apex and the Company, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company
Options pursuant to this _Section 3.01_ , or to cause any disposition or
acquisition of equity securities of Apex pursuant to this _Section 3.01_ by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "),
with respect to Apex or who will (or is reasonably expected to) become
subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Apex to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Apex shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare and file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable,
and in any event not more than 60 days following the Closing Date, a Form S-8
(or any successor form) registering the shares of Apex Common Stock
subject to such Exchanged Options and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

  



  

(c) At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without
any action on the part of Apex, Second Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the holders of any of the following securities, each share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Second Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable common membership unit of the Surviving Entity.

  



  

Section 3.02 _Exchange of Securities_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. On the Closing Date, Apex shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that shall be Continental
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company Capital
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_, (i) the Aggregate
Cash Consideration _minus_ the Aggregate Named Executive Cash-Settled Option
Consideration, and (ii) the Aggregate Stock Consideration (such shares of Apex
Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto and the Aggregate Cash Consideration _minus_ the Aggregate Named
Executive Cash-Settled Option Consideration being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Apex shall cause the Exchange Agent, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, to pay the Aggregate Cash Consideration and the
Aggregate Stock Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. Apex shall cause the Named Executive Option-Based Cash Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of Named Executive Cash-
Settled Options through the Surviving Entity's or its applicable subsidiary's
payroll system no later than the second regular payroll following the
Closing.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time and in any event within two Business Days following the
Effective Time (but in no event prior to the Effective Time), Apex shall cause
the Exchange Agent to deliver to each holder of Company Capital Stock, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Company Capital Stock was
converted pursuant to  _Section 3.01(a)_ into the right to receive, or
contributed to Apex pursuant to the Named Executive Equity Agreements in
exchange for the right to receive, the Per Share Amount and the Per Share
Contingent Consideration, if any, a letter of transmittal and instructions
for use in such exchange (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). The Letter of
Transmittal shall permit each holder of Company Common Stock to allocate for
tax purposes, on a share by share or "block" basis, (i) those shares of
Company Common Stock exchanged in the First Merger for shares of Apex Common
Stock that constitute such holder's portion of the Aggregate Stock
Consideration, and (ii) those shares of Company Common Stock exchanged in the
First Merger for such holder's portion of the Aggregate Cash Consideration.
Each holder of Company Capital Stock that has been converted pursuant to
_Section 3.01(a)_ into the right to receive, or contributed to Apex pursuant
to the Named Executive Equity Agreements in exchange for the right to
receive, the Per Share Amount and the Per Share Contingent Consideration, if
any, shall be entitled to receive such consideration represented by book-
entry upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of a duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal, a stock certificate (if any) representing
such Company Capital Stock and an IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate version of
IRS Form W-8, as applicable.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(c) _Election_. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock
(excluding any Dissenting Shares and Named Executive Shares) (each, an "
_Electing Stockholder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article III_ , to submit an Election in accordance with this
_Section 3.02(c)_ on or prior to the Election Deadline. The Company shall not
waive the Election Deadline unless such Election Deadline is waived with
respect to all Electing Stockholders, the new election deadline is disclosed
by the Company to all Electing Stockholders on a date agreed to by Apex, and
Apex has otherwise given its prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such waiver. " _Election Deadline_ "
means 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date that is five Business Days prior
to the Closing Date or such other date as Apex and the Company shall, prior
to the Closing, mutually agree (the period between the Mailing Date and the
Election Deadline, the " _Election Period_ "). At any time prior to the
Election Deadline, each Electing Stockholder may specify in a request made in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.02(c)_ (an " _Election_
") the Election Percentage desired by such Electing Stockholder. An Election
made by any Electing Stockholder shall apply to all shares of Company Common
Stock held by such Electing Stockholder. Apex shall prepare a form of election
that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Form of Election_ "),
and the Company shall mail and deliver or cause to be mailed and delivered,
together with the Registration Statement, the Form of Election to Electing
Stockholders, for purposes of obtaining the Elections (the " _Mailing Date_
"). The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make available one or
more Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all
persons who become Electing Stockholders during the period following the
Mailing Date and prior to the Election Deadline. Any Election shall have been
made properly only if the Company shall have received, by the Election
Deadline, (A) a Form of Election properly completed and signed in accordance
with the instructions therein, and (B) the properly completed and executed
documents required to be delivered by such Electing Stockholder pursuant to
the other provisions of this Section 3.02. Any Electing Stockholder that (i)
acquires shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to an exercise of Company
Options following the Mailing Date or (ii) does not make a valid Election by
the Election Deadline shall be deemed to have made an Election equal to 0%
(the " _Default Election Percentage_ "). Any Electing Stockholder may, at any
time during the Election Period, revoke or revise his, her or its Election by
written notice to the Company prior to the Election Deadline, together with a
properly completed and signed revised Form of Election. Any subsequent
transfer of such Electing Stockholder's shares of Company Common Stock after
such Electing Stockholder has made an Election shall not automatically revoke
such Election and such Election shall continue to be deemed effective unless a
written notice of revision is delivered to the Company. The Company shall not
permit any holder of a Company Option to exercise such Company Options
commencing on the date that is five Business Days prior to the Closing Date
and until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon termination of this
Agreement by the Company or Apex in accordance with _Article IX_. The Company
shall have reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is not properly
made, revised or revoked with respect to any shares of Company Common
Stock (none of the Company, Apex, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub or the
Company being under any duty to notify any Electing Stockholder of any
applicable defect). In the event the Company makes a reasonable determination
that an Election was not properly made (including as a result of the Company
not receiving an Election by the Election Deadline), such Election shall be
deemed to be ineffective, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by
such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to have made an
Election with an Election Percentage equal to the Default Election
Percentage. The Company shall provide a copy of each Form of
Election received by it to Apex and the Exchange Agent within two Business
Days following the receipt of such Form of Election.

  



  

   

29

 



    



  

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The Per Share Amount
payable upon conversion of the Company Capital Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof or contribution to Apex pursuant to the Named Executive Equity
Agreements shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Company Capital Stock.

  



  

(e) _Adjustments to Per Share Amount_. The Per Share Amount shall be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Apex Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Capital Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Apex, upon demand, and any
holders of Company Capital Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
_Section 3.02_ shall thereafter look only to Apex for the portion of the Gross
Merger Consideration payable to them. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Capital Stock as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Apex free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Apex, the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of Company
Capital Stock (including shares of Company Capital Stock contributed to Apex
pursuant to the Named Executive Equity Agreements) for any Apex Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law in
accordance with this _Section 3.02_.

  



  

(h) _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity, Merger Subs, Apex, and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement and
the Named Executive Equity Agreements such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

(i) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or shares representing
fractional shares of Apex Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of
Company Capital Stock and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Apex or a
holder of shares of Apex Common Stock. In lieu of any fractional share of Apex
Common Stock to which each holder of Company Capital Stock would otherwise be
entitled, the Exchange Agent shall round up or down to the nearest
whole share of Apex Common Stock, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up. No cash
settlements shall be made with respect to fractional shares eliminated by
rounding.

Section 3.03 _Contingent Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing, in addition to the consideration to be received
pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_ , the Company Stockholders and
Company Optionholders shall be issued additional shares of Apex Common Stock,
as follows:

  



  

(i) 1,000,000 shares of Apex Common Stock, in the aggregate, if at any time
prior to or as of the seventh anniversary of the Closing, (x) the Closing
Price is greater than or equal to $12.50 over any 20 Trading Days within any
30 Trading Day period or (y) Apex consummates a Subsequent Transaction, which
results in the stockholders of Apex having the right to exchange their shares
for cash, securities or other property having a value equaling or exceeding
$12.50 per share (the " _First Milestone_ ") (such 1,000,000 shares of Apex
Common Stock, the " _First Milestone Contingent Consideration_ ").

  



  

(ii) 1,000,000 shares of Apex Common Stock, in the aggregate, if at any time
prior to or as of the seventh anniversary of the Closing, (x) the Closing
Price is greater than or equal to $15.00 over any 20 Trading Days within any
30 Trading Day period or (y) Apex consummates a Subsequent Transaction, which
results in the stockholders of Apex having the right to exchange their shares
for cash, securities or other property having a value equaling or exceeding
$15.00 per share (the " _Second Milestone_ ") (such 1,000,000 shares of Apex
Common Stock, the " _Second Milestone Contingent Consideration_ ").

  



  

(iii) 1,000,000 shares of Apex Common Stock, in the aggregate, if at any time
prior to or as of the seventh anniversary of the Closing, (x) the Closing
Price is greater than or equal to $17.50 over any 20 Trading Days within any
30 Trading Day period or (y) Apex consummates a Subsequent Transaction, which
results in the stockholders of Apex having the right to exchange their shares
for cash, securities or other property having a value equaling or exceeding
$17.50 per share (the " _Third Milestone_ " and together with the First
Milestone and the Second Milestone, the " _Contingent Milestones_ ") (such
1,000,000 shares of Apex Common Stock, the " _Third Milestone Contingent
Consideration_ " and together with the First Milestone Contingent
Consideration and the Second Milestone Contingent Consideration, the "
_Contingent Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum amount
of the Contingent Consideration is 3,000,000 shares of Apex Common Stock, in
the aggregate.

  



  

(b) If any of the Contingent Milestones set forth in _Section 3.03(a)_ shall
have been achieved, within five Business Days following the achievement of
the applicable Contingent Milestone, Apex shall, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent or any replacement transfer agent engaged by Apex to, issue the
applicable Per Share Contingent Consideration to each Company Stockholder and
Company Optionholder.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 3.03(b)_ to the contrary, to the
extent that any portion of the Contingent Consideration that would
otherwise be issued to a Company Optionholder hereunder relates to a Company
Option exchanged for an Exchanged Option that remains unvested as of such
Contingent Milestone (each such Exchanged Option, an " _Unvested Exchanged
Option_ "), then in lieu of issuing the applicable Contingent Consideration,
Apex shall instead issue, as soon as practicable following the later of (i)
the occurrence of such Contingent Milestone and (ii) Apex's filing of a Form
S-8 Registration Statement, to each holder of an Unvested Exchanged Option,
an award of restricted stock units of Apex for a number of shares of Apex
Common Stock equal to such portion of the Contingent Consideration issuable
with respect to the Unvested Exchanged Option (the " _Contingent RSUs_ "). A
holder of an Unvested Exchanged Option shall only be granted Contingent RSUs
if such holder remains in continuous service to Apex or one of its
subsidiaries as of the applicable Contingent Milestone and the applicable
grant date of the Contingent RSUs. Such Contingent RSUs shall vest in equal
amounts (or as close as possible, with any excess shares vesting on the last
vesting date) over the remaining vesting schedule of the applicable Unvested
Exchanged Option and shall be subject to the same vesting conditions as
applied to the applicable Unvested Exchanged Option. All Contingent RSUs to be
issued hereunder shall be issued under and pursuant to the terms of the Apex
Equity Incentive Plan and shall cover a number of shares in addition to the
share reserve approved for all other awards under _Section 7.01(a)_ under such
Apex Equity Incentive Plan.

  



  

   

31

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.03(b) to the contrary, to the
extent that any portion of the Contingent Consideration that relates to a
Specified Option exchanged for an Exchanged Option would otherwise be issued
to a holder of a Specified Option before the Specified Option Delivery Date,
then such Contingent Consideration shall instead be issued on the Specified
Option Delivery Date.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.03(b) to the contrary, no
Contingent Consideration shall be issued in respect of any PRC Option, and
instead cash payment equal to the value of the Contingent Consideration as of
the close of the Trading Day on which the applicable Contingent Milestone is
achieved that otherwise would have been issuable in respect of such PRC Option
shall be made to the holder thereof in lieu of the applicable Contingent
Consideration.

  



  

(f) If any of the Contingent Milestones set forth in _Section 3.03(a)_ shall
not have been achieved on or prior to the seventh anniversary of the Closing,
the Company Stockholders and Company Optionholders shall have no further right
to receive the applicable Contingent Consideration.

  



  

(g) The Closing Price targets and any determination with respect to the
achievement of the Contingent Milestones and the amount of
Contingent Consideration and the Contingent RSUs shall be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into shares of Apex Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, merger, sale or exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to shares of Apex Common Stock, occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the time any such Contingent Consideration
is delivered to the Company Stockholders and Company Optionholders, if any.

  



  

(h) The right of a Company Stockholder or Company Optionholder to receive the
Per Share Contingent Consideration pursuant to this _Section 3.03_ (or
Contingent RSUs, if applicable) shall not be transferrable or assignable to
any other person except by will or intestacy upon the death of a Company
Stockholder or Company Optionholder that is a natural person and any shares of
Apex Common Stock issuable under this _Section 3.03_ shall be issued solely
in the name of, or for the benefit of, such Company Stockholder or
Company Optionholder or its permitted transferee in accordance with this
_Section 3.03(h)_.

  



  

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, if the condition for more than one Contingent
Milestone is achieved, the Contingent Consideration to be earned in
connection with such Contingent Milestone shall be cumulative with any
Contingent Consideration earned prior to such time in connection with the
achievement of any other Contingent Milestone; _provided_ that, for
avoidance of doubt, Contingent Consideration in respect of each Contingent
Milestone will be issued and earned only once and the aggregate
Contingent Consideration issued shall in no event exceed 3,000,000 shares of
Apex Common Stock.

  



  

Section 3.04 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records

any rights with respect to such Company Capital Stock, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law.

  



  

Section 3.05 _Appraisal Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to
the extent available under the DGCL, shares of Company Capital Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
stockholders of the Company who shall have neither voted in favor of the
Mergers nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly
in writing appraisal for such Company Capital Stock in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of
the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, and such stockholders
shall have no right to receive, the consideration payable pursuant to _Section
3.01(a)(ii)_  unless and until such stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws
or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL. Any stockholder of the Company who fails to perfect or who effectively
withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company Capital Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for,
as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)(ii)_ , without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, if applicable, in the manner provided in _Section 3.02(b)_ , of
the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company
Capital Stock (as the case may be).

  



  

   

32

 



    



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give Apex (i) prompt notice of
any demands for appraisal received by the Company and any withdrawals of such
demands, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Apex (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 4.04 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. The Company has all
necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party, to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder, and subject to receiving the Company Stockholder
Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party by the Company
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this

the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Mergers, the Company
Stockholder Approval, which the Written Consent shall satisfy, and the filing
and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL and
the DLLCA). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Apex and Merger Subs, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors'
rights generally, by general equitable principles (the " _Remedies
Exceptions_ "). The Company Board has approved this Agreement and the
Transactions, and such approvals are sufficient so that the restrictions on
business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL shall not apply to
the Mergers, this Agreement, the Stockholder Support Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement to which it is a party or any of the other Transactions. To the
knowledge of the Company, no other state takeover statute is applicable to the

of, or result in the creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on
any material property or asset of any Company Group Member pursuant to, any
Material Contract or Company Permit, except, with respect to _clauses (ii)_
and _(iii)_ , for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
to which it is a party by the Company does not, and the performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party by the Company
will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or
filing with or notification to, or expiration or termination of any waiting
period by, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for applicable
requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, state securities or "blue sky" laws
(" _Blue Sky Laws_ ") and state takeover laws, the pre-merger notification
requirements of the HSR Act, and filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL and the DLLCA, and (ii) where the failure to

to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.06 _Permits; Compliance_. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is in possession of all material franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents,
certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary
for each of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate
its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the

would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
No suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing. No Company Group Member
is in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law
applicable to such Company Group Member or by which any property or asset of
such Company Group Member is bound or affected, or (b) any Material Contract

material respect its sales practices or methods including, without

Company Group Member, all accounts payable of the Company Group reflected on

maintains records that in reasonable detailed accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of assets, (ii) that all transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board of
directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material
effect on its financial statements. The Company has delivered to Apex a true
and complete copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a summary thereof) by
any representative of the Company to the Company's independent auditors
relating to any material weaknesses in internal controls and any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that would
adversely affect the ability of the Company to record, process, summarize and
report financial data. The Company has no knowledge of any fraud or whistle-
blower allegations, whether or not material, that involve management or other
employees or consultants who have or had a significant role in the internal
control over financial reporting of the Company.

Section 5.05 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the approval by the stockholders of Apex of the Apex
Proposals, neither execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party by each of Apex and Merger Subs
do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is a party by each of Apex and Merger Subs will not, (i) conflict
with or violate the Apex Organizational Documents or the Merger Subs
Organizational Documents, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations, expiration or termination of waiting periods and other
actions described in _Section 5.05(b)_ have been obtained and all filings

61

 



    



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
to which it is a party by each of Apex and Merger Subs do not, and the
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party by each of Apex and Merger Subs will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, or
expiration or termination of any waiting period by, any Governmental
Authority, except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange
Act, Blue Sky Laws and state takeover laws, the pre-merger notification
requirements of the HSR Act, and filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL and DLLCA and (ii) where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent
or materially delay consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise
prevent Apex or either Merger Sub from performing its material
obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.06 _Compliance_. Neither Apex nor either Merger Sub is or has
been in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law
applicable to Apex or either Merger Sub or by which any property or asset of
Apex or either Merger Sub is bound or affected, or (b) any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation to which Apex or either Merger Sub is a
party or by which Apex or either Merger Sub or any property or asset of Apex
or either Merger Sub is bound, except, in each case, for any such conflicts,
defaults, breaches or violations that would not have or reasonably be expected
to have a Apex Material Adverse Effect. Each of Apex and Merger Subs is in
possession of all material franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals
and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary for Apex or such
Merger Sub to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Apex is not an "investment company" or
a person directly or indirectly "controlled" by or acting on behalf of an
"investment company", in each case within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act. Apex constitutes an "emerging growth company" within the meaning
of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
of 2012.

  



  

Section 5.07 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley_.

  



  

(a) Apex has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since its
incorporation, together with any amendments, restatements or supplements
thereto (collectively, the " _Apex SEC Reports_ "). Apex has
heretofore furnished to the Company true and correct copies of all amendments
and modifications that have not been filed by Apex with the SEC to all
agreements, documents and other instruments that previously had been filed by
Apex with the SEC and are currently in effect. As of their respective dates,
the Apex SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time they were
filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading, in the case of any Apex SEC Report that is a
registration statement, or include any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, in the case of any other Apex SEC Report. Each director
and executive officer of Apex has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all
documents required with respect to Apex by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder.

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

(b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any notes
thereto) contained in the Apex SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with
GAAP (applied on a consistent basis) and Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, as
applicable, throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material
respects, the financial position, results of operations, changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows of Apex as at the respective dates thereof
and for the respective periods indicated therein, (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which have
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to individually or in the
aggregate be material). Apex has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are
not disclosed in the Apex SEC Reports. No financial statements other than
those of Apex are required by GAAP to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of Apex.

  



  

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth in the Apex SEC Reports, neither
Apex nor either Merger Sub has any liability or obligation of a nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required to be reflected
on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities
and obligations arising in the ordinary course of Apex's and Merger Subs'
business.

  



  

(d) Apex is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Capital
Market.

  



  

(e) Apex has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to Apex
and other material information required to be disclosed by Apex in the
reports and other documents that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to Apex's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Apex's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Apex's periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act.

  



  

(f) Apex maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting that
are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that Apex maintains records
that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect, in all material
respects, its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board of
directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material
effect on its financial statements. Apex has delivered to the Company a true
and complete copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a summary thereof) by
any representative of Apex to Apex's independent auditors relating to any
material weaknesses in internal controls and any significant deficiencies in
the design or operation of internal controls that would adversely affect the
ability of Apex to record, process, summarize and report financial data. Apex
has no knowledge of any fraud or whistle-blower allegations, whether or not
material, that involve management or other employees or consultants who have
or had a significant role in the internal control over financial reporting of
Apex. Since June 30, 2020, there have been no material changes in Apex's
internal control over financial reporting.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(g) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by Apex
to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of Apex has not taken any action prohibited by Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(h) Neither Apex (including any employee thereof) nor Apex's independent
auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant deficiency
or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls utilized by
Apex, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves Apex's
management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial
statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by Apex or (iii) any
claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

  



  

(i) As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding SEC comments from the SEC
with respect to the Apex SEC Reports. To the knowledge of Apex, none of the
Apex SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date hereof is subject to ongoing
SEC review or investigation as of the date hereof.

  



  

Section 5.08 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since June 30, 2020
and prior to the date of this Agreement, except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, (a) each of Apex and Merger Subs has conducted its business
in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice, other
than due to any actions taken due to a "shelter in place," "non-essential
employee" or similar direction of any Governmental Authority, (b) neither
Apex nor either Merger Sub has sold, assigned, transferred, permitted to
lapse, abandoned, or otherwise disposed of any right, title, or interest in
or to any of its material assets, (c) there has not been a Apex Material
Adverse Effect, and (d) neither Apex or either Merger Sub has not taken any
action that, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would constitute a
material breach of any of the covenants set forth in _Section 6.02_.

  



  

Section 5.09 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Apex, threatened against Apex, either Merger Sub, or any property
or asset of Apex or either Merger Sub, before any Governmental Authority.
Neither Apex nor either Merger Sub, nor any material property or asset of Apex
or either Merger Sub is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree,
settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with, or, to the
knowledge of Apex, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority.

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.11 _No Prior Operations_

  



  

(a) Each Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Since its formation, none of
Apex or any Merger Sub has engaged in any business activities or conducted any

related to Apex's initial public offering and other activities directed toward
the accomplishment of a Business Combination or as contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(b) Except for Merger Subs and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, Apex does not own or have a right to
acquire, directly or indirectly, any interest or investment (whether equity or
debt) in any corporation, partnership, joint venture, business, trust or
other entity. Except for this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, Apex has no material interests,
rights, obligations or liabilities with respect to, and is not party to,
bound by or has its assets or property subject to, in each case whether
directly or indirectly, any contract or transaction which is, or would
reasonably be interpreted as constituting, a Business Combination. Except for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,

interest or investment (whether equity or debt) in any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, business, trust or other entity.

  



  

(c)  As of the date hereof and except for this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the other documents and transactions contemplated hereby and

after the date hereof in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate with respect
to any individual contract, other than Working Capital Loans. As of the

Loans.

  



  

Section 5.12 _Brokers_. Other than the Apex IPO Financial Advisors, no
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or
other fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Apex or either Merger Sub. Apex has
provided the Company with a true and complete copy of all outstanding
contracts, agreements and arrangements (including engagement letters) with the
Apex IPO Financial Advisors as of the date of this Agreement, other than
those that have expired or terminated with no further liability to Apex, and
as to which no further services are contemplated thereunder to be provided in
the future. All of the agreements pursuant to which Apex is obligated to pay
Apex Transaction Expenses or Apex IPO Underwriting Fees as of the date of this
Agreement are set forth on _Section 5.12_ of the Apex Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

Section 5.13 _Apex Trust Fund_. As of the date of this Agreement, Apex has
no less than $351,500,000 in the trust fund established by Apex for the
benefit of its public stockholders (the " _Trust Fund_ ") maintained in a
trust account (the " _Trust Account_ "). The monies of such Trust Account are
invested in United States Government securities or money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, and held in trust by Continental (the "
_Trustee_ ") pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Account Agreement,
dated as of September 16, 2019, between Apex and the Trustee (the " _Trust
Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and is
valid and in full force and effect and is enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Remedies Exceptions. Apex has complied in all material
respects with the terms of the Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof
or default thereunder and there does not exist under the Trust Agreement any
event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would constitute
such a breach or default by Apex or the Trustee. There are no
separate contracts, agreements, side letters or other understandings (whether
written or unwritten, express or implied): (i) between Apex and the Trustee
that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Apex SEC
Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) to the knowledge of
Apex, that would entitle any person (other than stockholders of Apex who shall
have elected to redeem their shares of Apex Class A Common Stock pursuant to
the Apex Organizational Documents) to any portion of the proceeds in the
Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust
Account may be released except: (A) to pay income and franchise taxes from
any interest income earned in the Trust Account; and (B) upon the exercise of
Redemption Rights in accordance with the provisions of the Apex
Organizational Documents. As of the date hereof, there are no Actions pending
or, to the knowledge of Apex, threatened in writing with respect to the Trust
Account. Upon consummation of the Mergers and notice thereof to the
Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, Apex shall cause the Trustee to, and
the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to Apex as promptly as
practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with the Trust Agreement at which
point the Trust Account shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
liabilities and obligations of Apex due and owing or incurred at or prior to
the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due, including all amounts
payable (a) to stockholders of Apex who shall have exercised their Redemption
Rights, (b) with respect to filings, applications or other actions taken
pursuant to this Agreement required under Law, (c) to the Trustee for fees
and costs incurred in accordance with the Trust Agreement; and (d) for
unpaid Apex Transaction Expenses. As of the date hereof, assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein and the
compliance by the Company with its respective obligations hereunder, Apex has
no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the
Trust Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account
will not be available to Apex at the Effective Time.

  

   

66

incurred by Apex's officers and directors in connection with activities on
Apex's behalf in an aggregate amount not in excess of the amount of cash held
by Apex outside of the Trust Account, Apex has no unsatisfied material
liability with respect to any employee, officer or director. Apex and Merger

in the Private Placement solely for purposes of consummating the transactions
contemplated hereby in an aggregate amount equal to $140,000,000 (the " _PIPE
Commitment_ "). As of the date hereof, the Subscription Agreement with each

enforceable against Apex in accordance with its terms subject to the Remedies
Exceptions and, to the knowledge of Apex, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each PIPE Investor, enforceable against each PIPE Investor in

the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Apex under
any material term or condition of any Subscription Agreement and, as of the
date hereof, Apex has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
in all material respects on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to
be satisfied by it contained in any Subscription Agreement. The Subscription
Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than the conditions
contained in the other Ancillary Agreements) to the obligations of the PIPE

cash proceeds of Apex's initial public offering and substantially all of those
proceeds have been deposited in the Trust Account for the benefit of Apex,
certain of its public stockholders and the underwriters of Apex's initial
public offering. The Company acknowledges that it has been advised by Apex
that, except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust
Account that may be released to Apex to pay its franchise tax, income tax and
similar obligations, the Trust Agreement provides that cash in the Trust
Account may be disbursed only (i) if Apex completes the transactions
which constitute a Business Combination, then to those persons and in such
amounts as described in the Prospectus; (ii) if Apex fails to complete a
Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject
to the terms of the Trust Agreement, to Apex in limited amounts to permit
Apex to pay the costs and expenses of its liquidation and dissolution, and
then to Apex's public stockholders; and (iii) if Apex holds a stockholder
vote to amend the Apex Organizational Documents to modify the substance or
timing of the obligation to redeem 100% of Apex Class A Common Stock if Apex

connection with such vote. For and in consideration of Apex entering into
this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Company hereby irrevocably waives any right, title, interest or claim of
any kind they have or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust
Account or any distributions therefrom and agree not to seek recourse against
the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom as a result of, or
arising out of, this Agreement and any negotiations, contracts or agreements
with Apex; _provided_ , that (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit the Company's right to pursue a claim against Apex for legal relief
against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific
performance or other equitable relief in connection with the consummation of
the transactions (including a claim for Apex to specifically perform its
obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance of
the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after giving effect to the
Redemption Rights) to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long as such claim would not
affect Apex's ability to fulfil its obligation to effectuate the Redemption
Rights, or for Fraud and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit
any claims that the Company may have in the future against Apex's assets or
funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have
been released from the Trust Account and any assets that have been purchased
or acquired with any such funds).

initial party to such Subscription Agreement remains bound by its obligations
with respect thereto in the event that the transferee or assignee, as
applicable, does not comply with its obligations to consummate the purchase of
shares of Apex Common Stock contemplated thereby. Subject to the immediately
preceding sentence and in the event that all conditions in the Subscription
Agreements have been satisfied, Apex shall use its reasonable best efforts to

permitted to make without the prior written consent of the Company in
accordance with _Section 7.10(c)_ , (ii) to the knowledge of Apex, of any
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would give rise to any breach or default) by
any party to any Subscription Agreement; (iii) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any party to any Subscription
Agreement with respect to any actual, potential, threatened, or claimed
expiration, lapse, withdrawal, breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to any Subscription Agreement or any provisions of any Subscription

legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede, except as set forth in
_Section 7.04(b)_, all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreements. This Agreement shall
not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or
otherwise) by any party without the prior express written consent of the
other parties hereto.

  



  

Section 10.05 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than _Section 7.08_ (which is intended to be
for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such
persons).

  



  

Section 10.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All Actions arising
out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively
in any Delaware Chancery Court; _provided_ , that if jurisdiction is not then
available in the Delaware Chancery Court, then any such Action may be brought
in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware
state court. The parties hereto hereby (a) irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for themselves and with respect
to their respective properties for the purpose of any Action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) agree not
to commence any Action relating thereto except in the courts described above
in Delaware, other than Actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware
as described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as
provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the
parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason,
(b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

Section 10.07 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have
to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the
Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section 10.07_.

  



  

Section 10.08 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission) in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

Section 10.10 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a)  The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a party to cause the
other parties to consummate the Transactions. It is agreed that the parties
are entitled to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each such party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Such Action shall be brought in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if that court does not
have jurisdiction, any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware.

  



  

(b) The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to any applicable Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each of the parties
hereby further waives any defense in any action for specific performance that
a remedy at law would be adequate.

  



  

Section 10.11 _No Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes
of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and such representations and
warranties are those solely of) the persons that are expressly identified as
parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the " _Contracting Parties_ ")
except as set forth in this _Section 10.11_. No person who is not a
Contracting Party, including any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, affiliate,
agent, attorney, Representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or
lender to, any Contracting Party, or any current, former or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative or assignee of, and any financial
advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty
Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach, except with respect to willful and material breach or actual and
intentional common law fraud under the laws of the State of Delaware ("
_Fraud_ ") against the person who committed such willful and material breach
or Fraud, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims,
causes of action, and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates.

Corporation or the Surviving Entity, and even though such counsel may have
represented Apex in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for Apex, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity or the Sponsor. Apex and the Company, on behalf of their respective
successors and assigns (including, after the Closing, the Surviving

privileged communications prior to the Closing (made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any
dispute or Action arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby) between or among Apex, the Sponsor or any other member of the Apex

(b) Apex and the Company, on behalf of their respective successors and
assigns (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Entity), hereby agree that, in the event a dispute with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby arises after the
Closing between or among (i) the stockholders or holders of other equity
interests of the Company and any of their respective directors, members,
partners, officers, employees or affiliates (other than the Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Entity) (collectively, the " _AvePoint Group_
"), on the one hand, and (y) the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity
or any member of the Apex Group, on the other hand, any legal counsel,
including Cooley LLP (" _Cooley_ ") that represented the Company prior to the
Closing may represent any member of the AvePoint Group in such dispute even
though the interests of such persons may be directly adverse to the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Entity, and even though such counsel may have
represented Apex or the Company in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Surviving Corporation or
the Surviving Entity, further agree that, as to all legally privileged
communications prior to the Closing (made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute
or Action arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby) between or
among the Company or any member of the AvePoint Group, on the one hand, and
Cooley, on the other hand, the attorney/client privilege and the expectation
of client confidence shall survive the Mergers and belong to the AvePoint
Group after the Closing, and shall not pass to or be claimed or controlled by
the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any privileged communications or information shared by Apex prior
to the Closing with the Company under a common interest agreement shall be
and remain the privileged communications or information of the Apex Group, and
not Apex.
