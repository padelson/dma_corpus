is delivered to the Company. The Company shall not permit any holder of a Company Option to exercise such Company Options commencing

discretion to determine if any Election is not properly made, revised or revoked with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock

as a result of the Company not receiving an Election by the Election Deadline), such Election shall be deemed to be ineffective,
and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to have made an Election
with an Election Percentage equal to the Default Election Percentage. The Company shall provide a copy of each Form of Election
received by it to Apex and the Exchange Agent within two Business Days following the receipt of such Form of Election.</P>

Investors</U></B>&rdquo;), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have committed to purchase shares of Apex Common Stock at a purchase
price of $10.00 per share in the Private Placement solely for purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated hereby in
an aggregate amount equal to $140,000,000 (the &ldquo;<B><U>PIPE Commitment</U></B>&rdquo;). As of the date hereof, the Subscription

modified, in any respect, and no withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is contemplated by Apex. Each Subscription
Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Apex, enforceable against Apex in accordance with its terms subject to the
Remedies Exceptions and, to the knowledge of Apex, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of each PIPE Investor, enforceable
against each PIPE Investor in accordance with its terms subject to the Remedies Exceptions. There are no other agreements, side
letters, or arrangements between Apex and any PIPE Investor relating to any Subscription Agreement or the Private Placement that
could affect the obligation of such PIPE Investors to purchase the shares of Apex Common Stock in the Private Placement equal
to the commitment amount set forth in the Subscription Agreement of such PIPE Investor. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Apex under any material
term or condition of any Subscription Agreement and, as of the date hereof, Apex has no reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in any
Subscription Agreement. The Subscription Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than the conditions contained
in the other Ancillary Agreements) to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to purchase the shares of Apex Common Stock in the

assets consist of the cash proceeds of Apex&rsquo;s initial public offering and substantially all of those proceeds have been

initial public offering. The Company acknowledges that it has been advised by Apex that, except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to Apex to pay its franchise tax, income tax and similar obligations,
the Trust Agreement provides that cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) if Apex completes the transactions which
constitute a Business Combination, then to those persons and in such amounts as described in the Prospectus; (ii) if Apex fails
to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement,
to Apex in limited amounts to permit Apex to pay the costs and expenses of its liquidation and dissolution, and then to Apex&rsquo;s
public stockholders; and (iii) if Apex holds a stockholder vote to amend the Apex Organizational Documents to modify the substance
or timing of the obligation to redeem 100% of Apex Class A Common Stock if Apex fails to complete a Business Combination within
the allotted time period, then for the redemption of any Apex Class A Common Stock properly tendered in connection with such vote.

any monies in the Trust Account or any distributions therefrom and agree not to seek recourse against the Trust Account or any

under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after giving effect
to the Redemption Rights) to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Trust Agreement)

by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed

Chancery Court; <U>provided</U>, that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Delaware Chancery Court, then any such Action
may be brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court. The parties hereto hereby
(a) irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for themselves and with respect to their respective
properties for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) agree
not to commence any Action relating thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than Actions in any court
of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein.
Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties
further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the Action in any such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.</FONT></P>
