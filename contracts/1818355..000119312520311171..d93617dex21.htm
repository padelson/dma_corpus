REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PGHL PARTIES

 

Except as set forth in the PGHL Schedules to this Agreement (each of which
qualifies (a) the correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or
covenant if specified therein and (b) such other representations, warranties
or covenants where its relevance as an exception to (or disclosure for
purposes of) such other representation, warranty or covenant is reasonably
apparent on its face), PGHL and, solely for the purposes of _Section_ __ _
5.03_, _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, each PGHL Party
represents and warrants to FTAC as follows:

 

Section 5.01 _Corporate Organization of PGHL_. PGHL has been duly
incorporated, is validly existing as a private limited company and is in good
standing (or has the equivalent status under the laws of England and Wales)
and has the corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties, rights and assets and to conduct its business as it is now being
conducted, except where such failure to be in good standing or to have such
corporate power and authority would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.
The copies of the organizational documents of PGHL, as in effect on the date
hereof, previously made available by PGHL to FTAC (i) are true, correct and
complete and (ii) are in full force and effect. PGHL has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease all of its properties,
rights and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted
and is duly licensed or qualified and in good standing as a foreign entity in
each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the character of
its activities is such as to require it to be so licensed or qualified,
except where failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be
expected to constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. PGHL is not in violation of any of the provisions of its
organizational documents.

Section 5.02 _Subsidiaries_. The Significant Subsidiaries of PGHL as of the
date of this Agreement are set forth on  _Schedule 5.02_ of the PGHL
Schedules. The Significant Subsidiaries have been duly formed or organized,
are validly existing under the laws of their jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and have the power and authority to own, operate and lease their
properties, rights and assets and to conduct their business as it is now being
conducted, except where such failure to have such power and authority would
not reasonably be expected to constitute, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect. Each Significant Subsidiary is duly licensed or
qualified and in good standing as a foreign or extra-provincial corporation
(or other entity, if applicable) in each jurisdiction in which its ownership
of property or the character of its activities is such as to require it to be
so licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be in good standing or
so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each PGHL Party
(other than PGHL) was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has not conducted any business
prior to the date hereof and has no assets, Liabilities or obligations of any
nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and any Transaction Agreement to which it is a party, as applicable,
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
Transaction Agreements, as applicable.

Section 5.03 _Due Authorization_. Each PGHL Party has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each
Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and (subject to the approvals
described in Section 5.05) to perform all obligations to be performed by it
hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and such Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by the board of
directors or equivalent governing body of the applicable PGHL Party and the
Company has, by its execution and delivery hereof, delivered the Merger Sub
Stockholder Approval, and no other corporate proceeding on the part of any
PGHL Party is necessary to authorize this Agreement or such Transaction
Agreements. This Agreement has been, and each such Transaction Agreement will
(when executed and

 



\- 24 -

    

 delivered) be, duly and validly executed and delivered by each PGHL Party
and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery by each
other party hereto and thereto, this Agreement constitutes, and each such
Transaction Agreement will constitute, a valid and binding obligation of each
PGHL Party, enforceable against such PGHL Party in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general
principles of equity, whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at Law (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

Section 5.04 _No Conflict_. Subject to the receipt of the consents,
approvals, authorizations and other requirements set forth in Section 5.05,
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Transaction
Agreement to which any PGHL Party is party by such PGHL Party and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not
and will not (a) violate any provision of, or result in the breach of or

assets of PGHL or any of its Subsidiaries, (e) constitute an event which,
after notice or lapse of time or both, would result in any such
violation, breach, termination, acceleration, modification, cancellation or
creation of a Lien or (f) result in a violation or revocation of any license,
permit or approval from any Governmental Authority or other Person, except,
(i) in the case of clause (b) above, for such violations, breaches or
defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to PGHL
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) in the case of clauses (c),
(d), (e) and (f) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults or
failures to act that would not reasonably be expected to constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

completeness of the representations and warranties of FTAC contained in this
Agreement, no action by, consent, approval, permit or authorization of, or
designation, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority

of its Subsidiaries owns any equity, ownership, profit, voting or similar
interest in or any interest convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for, any

currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted as of the Closing other

in the acceleration or creation of any rights of any current or former
employee, officer, director or consultant of FTAC or its Subsidiaries
to payments or benefits or increases in any payments or benefits or any loan
forgiveness or (ii) result in severance pay or any increase in severance pay

constitute a default or breach on the part of FTAC under any material term or
condition of any Subscription Agreement and, as of the date hereof, FTAC has

withdrawn, terminated, amended, modified or waived since the date of
execution and prior to the execution of this Agreement, and as of the date of
this Agreement no such withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is
contemplated, and as of the date of this Agreement the commitments contained
in the Forward Purchase Agreement have not been withdrawn, terminated or
rescinded by the FP Investor in any respect. FTAC has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required in connection with the Forward
Purchase Agreement that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and will

other contingencies related to the FTAC Financing to be provided pursuant to
the Forward Purchase Agreement, other than as expressly set forth in the
Forward Purchase Agreement. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to (a) constitute a default or breach on the part of
FTAC or, to the knowledge of FTAC, (b) assuming the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ will be satisfied,
constitute a failure to satisfy, or caused to be satisfied, a condition on the
part of FTAC, or (c) assuming the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.02_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.03 _will be satisfied, to the knowledge of FTAC,
result in any portion of the amounts to be paid by the FP Investor in
accordance with the Forward Purchase Agreement being unavailable on the
Closing Date. As of the date hereof, assuming the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ will be satisfied, FTAC has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the consummation of the
purchases under the Forward Purchase Agreement will not be satisfied, and, as
of the date hereof, FTAC is not aware of the existence of any fact or event
that would or would reasonably be expected to cause such conditions not to be
satisfied.

ARTICLE VIII

 

COVENANTS OF FTAC

 

Section 8.01 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company agrees that (to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Bermuda law) it shall indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director, manager and officer of PGHL and
FTAC and each of their respective Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or Liabilities incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that the Company, FTAC or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, would have been permitted under applicable Law and their respective
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in
effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (including the
advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall cause the
Surviving Entity and each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) maintain for a period of
not less than six years from the Effective Time provisions in its certificate
of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents concerning the
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of officers and directors/managers that are no less favorable to
those Persons than the provisions of such certificates of incorporation,
bylaws and other organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement
and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect
that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each
case, except as required by Law.

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Company shall, or
shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect directors
and officers liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently
covered by PGHLs or any of its Subsidiaries directors and officers
liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have
been heretofore made available to FTAC or its agents or representatives) on
terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage,
except that in no event shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be required to
pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 225% of the aggregate
annual premium payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance
policy for the year ended December 31, 2019;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
PGHL or the Company may, in the alternative, cause coverage to be extended
under the current directors and officers liability insurance by obtaining a
six-year "tail" policy containing terms not less favorable than the terms of
such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Tail_"), except that in
no event shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be required to pay an annual
premium for such insurance in excess of 225% of the aggregate annual premium
payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such current insurance.

 

(c) FTAC and PGHL hereby acknowledge (on behalf of themselves and their
respective Subsidiaries) that the indemnified Persons under this _Section_ __
_ 8.01_ may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and/or insurance provided by current stockholders, members, or other
Affiliates of such stockholders or members (" _Indemnitee_

 



\- 54 -

    

  _Affiliates_ ") separate from the indemnification obligations of FTAC, PGHL
and their respective Subsidiaries hereunder. The Parties hereby agree (i) that
FTAC, PGHL and their respective Subsidiaries are the indemnitors of first
resort (i.e., its obligations to the indemnified Persons under this _Section_
__ _ 8.01_ are primary and any obligation of any Indemnitee Affiliate to
advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or
Liabilities incurred by the indemnified Persons under this _Section_ __ _
8.01_ are secondary), (ii) that FTAC, PGHL and their respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by the
indemnified Persons under this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ and shall be liable for
the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid
in settlement to the extent legally permitted and required by FTACs, PGHLs
and their respective Subsidiaries governing documents or any director or
officer indemnification agreements, without regard to any rights the
indemnified Persons under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ may have against any
Indemnitee Affiliate, and (iii) that the Parties (on behalf of themselves and
their respective Subsidiaries) irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the
Indemnitee Affiliates from any and all claims against the Indemnitee
Affiliates for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in
respect thereof.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section_ __ _ 8.01_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and all successors and assigns of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Entity. In the event that the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_.

Section 8.02 _Conduct of FTAC During the_ _Interim Period_.

claim a material refund of Taxes or consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitations period applicable to any material Tax claim or assessment;

adoption to any such person and (y) any Person with whom any Director or
Officer of FTAC, the Founder or the FP Investor has a direct or indirect legal
or contractual relationship or beneficial ownership interest of 5% or greater)
or any other FTAC Affiliate Agreement; 

(v) enter into, renew or amend in any material respect, any transaction or

material claim (which shall include, but not be limited to, any pending or

if necessary, in order to resolve any such objections or challenge as such
Governmental Authority or private party may have to any of the Transactions

hereto to litigate in connection with such matters must be mutually agreed by
the parties hereto.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, FTAC shall, and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates to, take any and all actions necessary to obtain any
authorization, consent or approval of a Governmental Authority (including in
connection with any Governmental Filings) necessary or advisable so as to
enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as expeditiously as
possible (and in any event, no later than the Termination Date) and to
resolve, avoid or eliminate any impediments or objections, if any, that may be
asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Law, or to otherwise

action with respect to, or its ability to retain or control, one or more of
the businesses, product lines, rights or assets of FTAC and its controlled
Affiliates or interest therein, in each case as may be required in order to

and delivery of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of,
such acquisition, or the taking of any other action, could in any material

or increase the risk of not obtaining, consents of a Governmental
Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of a
Governmental Authority seeking or entering a Governmental Order prohibiting
the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) increase the risk of not being

member of PGHLs group (the " _171A Elections_ ");

sections 780 or 785 CTA 2009 in connection with any of the transactions

_792 Elections_ " and, together with the 171A Elections, the " _Elections_ ");

 

and for the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.05(f)_, PGHL shall provide the
Relevant Entity, and the parties shall ensure that the Relevant Entity shall
provide PGHL, all information, documentation and assistance reasonably
requested by the Relevant Entity or PGHL, as the case may be, for the purposes
of making any Claims or Elections. Once made, the Claims (except to the
extent such Claims are not accepted by HM Revenue and Customs as being

 extent the Claims are accepted by HM Revenue and Customs as being effective)
shall be irrevocable and each of the parties agrees (x) not to take any step
which would undermine the validity or effectiveness of the Claims or
Elections (and for the avoidance of doubt the making of a Claim shall not be
regarded as undermining the validity or effectiveness of the Elections and
vice versa); and (y) to the extent permitted by law, to act in a manner
consistent with the Claims or Elections, including preparing and filing all
Tax computations and Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Claims or
Elections (and, in the case of PGHL, accounting to HMRC for an amount equal
to any Tax charge arising to PGHL or any other member of PGHLs group as a
result of the Elections within applicable time limits) and not amending any
Tax computation or Tax Returns in a manner that would be inconsistent with the
Claims or Elections, provided that the Relevant Entity shall not be obliged

court without the consent of the Parties.

Section 12.06 _Governing_ _Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or
rules would require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

Section 12.07 _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

Section 12.08 _Schedules_ _and Exhibits_. The Schedules and Exhibits
referenced herein are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.
All references herein to Schedules and Exhibits shall be deemed references to
such parts of this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require. Any
disclosure made by a Party in the Schedules with reference to any section or
schedule of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure with respect to
all other sections or schedules to which such disclosure may apply solely to
the extent the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on the
face of the disclosure in such Schedule. Certain information set forth in the
Schedules is included solely for informational purposes.

 

Section 12.09 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Schedules
and Exhibits to this Agreement), the other Transaction Agreements and that
certain Letter Agreement, dated as of August 28, 2020, by and between PGHL and
Trasimene Capital Management, LLC (as amended, modified or supplemented from
time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have
been made or entered into by or among any of the Parties or any of
their respective Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby. No representations, warranties, covenants, understandings, agreements,
oral or otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
exist between the Parties except as expressly set forth or referenced in this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



\- 75 -

    

Section 12.10 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole
or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the
same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any of the Parties shall not
restrict the ability of the board of directors (or other body performing
similar functions) of any of the Parties to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ or to cause such Party to enter into an
amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.10_.

Section 12.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
Parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise
modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held
invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect
to the intent of the Parties.

 

Section 12.12 _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Any Action based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby may be brought in federal and state courts located in the State of
Delaware, and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any objection
it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to
convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be
heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to affect the right of any Party to serve process in any manner
permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against any other Party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce
judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
12.12_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 12.13 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions
as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) or
any Transaction Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable
relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and thereof,
without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none
of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. Each Party agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or
that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 12.13_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such injunction. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, FTAC acknowledges and agrees that any PGHL Party may, without
breach of this Agreement, with respect to any Transaction Agreement to which
such PGHL Party is a party, institute or pursue an Action directly against
the counterparty(ies) to such Transaction Agreement seeking, or seek or obtain
a court order against the counterparty(ies) to such Transaction Agreement for,
injunctive relief, specific performance, or other equitable relief with
respect to such Transaction Agreement.

 



\- 76 -

    

Section 12.14 _Non-Recourse_. Subject in all respect to the last sentence,
this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the entities that are
expressly named as Parties and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Except to the extent
a Party hereto (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by such Party in this Agreement), (a) no past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any
Party and (b) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any
Liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or
more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of any PGHL Party or FTAC under
this Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 12.14_ shall limit, amend or waive
any rights of any party to any Transaction Agreement.

 

Section 12.15 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None
of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other
agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any
breach of such representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Closing and
instead shall terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the Effective Time
(and there shall be no liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except
for (a) those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms
expressly apply in whole or in part at or after the Closing and then only with
respect to any breaches occurring at or after the Closing (including, for the
avoidance of doubt  _Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_) and (b) this _Article XII_.

Section 12.16 _Acknowledgements_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees (on its own behalf and on
behalf of its respective Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives) that: (i) it has conducted its own independent investigation
of the financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities,
properties and projected operations of the other Parties (and their
respective Subsidiaries) and has been afforded satisfactory access to the
books and records, facilities and personnel of the other Parties (and their
respective Subsidiaries) for purposes of conducting such investigation; (ii)
the PGHL Representations constitute the sole and exclusive representations
and warranties of the PGHL Parties; (iii) FTAC Representations constitute the
sole and exclusive representations and warranties of FTAC; (iv) except for the
PGHL Representations by the PGHL Parties and FTAC Representations by FTAC,
none of the Parties or any other Person makes, or has made, any other express
or implied representation or warranty with respect to any Party (or any
Partys Subsidiaries), including any implied warranty or representation as to
condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose or
trade as to any of the assets of the such Party or its Subsidiaries or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all other representations and
warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied (including (x) regarding
the completeness or accuracy of, or any omission to state or to disclose, any
information, including in the estimates, projections or forecasts or any
other information, document or material provided to or made available to any
Party or their respective Affiliates or Representatives in certain "data
rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of
the Transactions, including meetings, calls or correspondence with management
of any Party (or any Partys Subsidiaries), and (y) any relating to the future
or historical business, condition (financial or otherwise), results of 

 



\- 77 -

    

 operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of any Party (or its
Subsidiaries), or the quality, quantity or condition of any Partys or its
Subsidiaries assets) are specifically disclaimed by all Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries and all other Persons (including the Representatives
and Affiliates of any Party or its Subsidiaries); and (v) each Party and its
respective Affiliates are not relying on any representations and warranties
in connection with the Transactions except the PGHL Representations by the
PGHL Parties and the FTAC Representations by FTAC. The foregoing does not
limit any rights of any Party pursuant to any other Transaction Agreement
against any other Party pursuant to such Transaction Agreement to which it is
a party or an express third party beneficiary thereof. Except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, FTAC understands and agrees that any
assets, properties and business of PGHL and its Subsidiaries are furnished
"as is", "where is" and subject to and except for the PGHL Representations by
the PGHL Parties or as provided in any certificate delivered in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 10.02(c)_, with all faults and without any other
representation or warranty of any nature whatsoever.

 

(b) Effective upon Closing, each of the Parties waives, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its respective Affiliates and Representatives, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, Actions and causes
of action it may have against any other Party or their respective Subsidiaries
and any of their respective current or former Affiliates or Representatives
relating to the operation of any Party or its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Schedules,
or the Exhibits to this Agreement, whether arising under or based upon
any federal, state, local or foreign statute, Law, ordinance, rule or
regulation or otherwise. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it will not
assert, institute or maintain any Action, suit, investigation, or proceeding
of any kind whatsoever, including a counterclaim, cross-claim, or defense,
regardless of the legal or equitable theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, that makes any claim contrary to the
agreements and covenants set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 12.16_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 12.16(b)_ shall preclude any Party from seeking any remedy for actual and
intentional fraud by a Party solely and exclusively with respect to the
making of any representation or warranty by it in _Article V_ or _Article VI_
(as applicable). Each Party shall have the right to enforce this _Section_ __
_ 12.16_ on behalf of any Person that would be benefitted or protected by
this _Section_ __ _ 12.16_ if they were a party hereto. The foregoing
agreements, acknowledgements, disclaimers and waivers are irrevocable. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 12.16_ shall limit,
modify, restrict or operate as a waiver with respect to, any rights any Party
may have under any written agreement entered into in connection with the
transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement, including any other
Transaction Agreement.

Section 12.17 _Provisions Respecting Representation of_ _PGHL_. Each of the
Parties hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
managers, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP (" _Counsel_ ") may serve as counsel to PGHL, on the
one hand, and PGHLs Subsidiaries (individually and collectively, the "
_Seller Group_ "), on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Counsel (or any of its
respective successors) may serve as counsel to Seller Group or any director,
manager, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of any member of
Seller Group, in connection with any Action or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation of PGHL
and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and each of the Parties (on its own behalf and
on behalf of its Affiliates) hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives
any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall
cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to irrevocably waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation. The parties agree to take the steps
necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of
Counsel representing PGHL or any of its Subsidiaries in

 



\- 78 -

    

 connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, _provided_ that such privilege
from and after the Closing shall be controlled by PGHL on behalf of the
Seller Group. As to any privileged attorney-client communications between
Counsel and PGHL or Counsel and any of PGHLs Subsidiaries in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), FTAC, PGHL and each of
its Subsidiaries , together with any of their respective Affiliates,
Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely
on any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any
of the parties after the Closing. In addition, if the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all Privileged
Communications related to such transactions will become the property of (and
be controlled by) PGHL or its direct or indirect equityholders, and none of
FTAC, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns shall retain any copies of
such records or have any access to them. In the event that FTAC is legally
required or requested by any Governmental Authority to access or obtain a copy
of all or a portion of the Privileged Communications, FTAC shall be entitled
to access or obtain a copy of and disclose the Privileged Communications to
the extent necessary to comply with any such legal requirement or request;
_provided_ that FTAC shall promptly notify PGHL in writing (prior to the
disclosure by FTAC of any Privileged Communications to the extent practicable)
so that PGHL can seek a protective order, at its sole cost and expense, and
FTAC agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

[Signature pages follow.]

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have hereunto caused this Agreement and
Plan of Merger to be duly executed as of the date hereof.

use its reasonable best efforts to cause the election of each such designee

consistent with the Director compensation received by other Directors,
including any fees and equity awards, provided, that (x) to the extent any
Director compensation is payable in the form of equity awards, at the election
of a Shareholder Designee that is an employee or affiliate of a Principal
Shareholder, in lieu of any equity award, such compensation shall be paid in
an amount of cash equal to the value of the equity award as of the date of the
award, with any such cash subject to the same vesting terms, if any, as the
equity awarded to other Directors and (y) at the election of a Shareholder
Designee that is an employee or affiliate of a Principal Shareholder, any
Director compensation (whether cash, equity awards and/or cash in lieu of
equity as may be designated by the electing Shareholder Designee) shall be
paid to a Principal Shareholder or an Affiliate thereof specified by such
Shareholder Designee rather than to such Shareholder Designee. If the Company
adopts a policy that Directors own a minimum amount of equity in the Company,
any Shareholder Designee that is an employee or affiliate of a Principal
Shareholder shall not be subject to such policy unless otherwise determined by
such Principal Shareholder in its sole discretion.

 

2.4 _Other Rights of Shareholder Designees_. Except as provided in _Section_

furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, exculpate, and reimburse fees and
expenses of the Shareholder Designees (including by entering into an
indemnification agreement in a form substantially similar to the Companys
form director indemnification agreement) and provide the Shareholder
Designees with director and officer insurance to the same extent it
indemnifies, exculpates, reimburses and provides insurance for the other
members of the Board pursuant to the memorandum of association or bye-laws of
the Company, applicable Law or otherwise.

2.5  _Director Independence and Applicable Regulatory Requirements_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereto shall
ensure that the composition of the Board will continue to meet all
requirements for a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (or such
other stock exchange on which the Common Shares may be listed from time to
time), including with respect to director independence, and any other Laws or
requirements of a Governmental Authority applicable to members of the Board.
In the event a Shareholder Designee is prevented from serving as a Director by
a Governmental Authority with the ability to so prevent, each of the Company,
Pi Topco, PGHL and each Principal Shareholder shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Governmental Authority to remove
such restriction; _provided_ , that, (x) there shall be no obligation for such
person to be added as a member of the Board and (y) the Shareholder
Designator that had designated such Shareholder Designee shall be entitled to
designate a replacement Director in lieu of such person. In addition, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that: (i) there is no
agreement, arrangement or understanding for any of the Directors to vote or
act together; (ii) that each Director shall act individually in respect of the
matters that come before the Board consistent with the fiduciary duties of
each Director; and (iii) each Director shall at all times act in accordance
with applicable Law and shall refrain from taking any action which would cause
the Principal Shareholders to contravene applicable Law.

public filings on the EDGAR System or any successor or replacement system of
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the requirement to deliver such
information shall be deemed satisfied;

(ii) make appropriate officers and/or Directors of the Company available, and
cause the officers and directors of its Subsidiaries to be made available,
periodically and at such times as reasonably requested by each VCOC Investor,
upon reasonable notice and at mutually convenient times, for consultation with
such VCOC Investor or its designated representative with respect to matters
relating to the business and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries;

 



11

    

(iii) to the extent that the VCOC Investor requests to receive such
information and rights, and to the extent consistent with applicable Law or
listing standards (and with respect to events which require public disclosure,
only following the Companys public disclosure thereof through applicable
securities law filings or otherwise), inform each VCOC Investor or its
designated representative in advance with respect to any significant corporate
actions, and to provide (or cause to be provided) each VCOC Investor or its
designated representative with the right to consult with the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to such actions should the VCOC Investor elect to do
so; _provided, however_ , that this right to consult must be exercised within
five days after the Company informs the VCOC Investor of the
proposed corporate action; _provided, further_ , that the Company shall be
under no obligation to provide the VCOC Investor with any material non-public
information with respect to such corporate action; and

 

(iv) provide each VCOC Investor or its designated representative with such
other rights of consultation which the VCOC Investors counsel may determine
in writing to be reasonably necessary under applicable legal authorities
promulgated after the date hereof to qualify its investment in the Company as
a "venture capital investment" for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation; 
_provided_ that the parties agree that any such rights of consultation shall
be of a nature consistent with those granted above and nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require the Company to grant to the VCOC Investor
any additional rights with respect to the governance or management of the
Company.

(b) The Company agrees to consider, in good faith, the recommendations of
each VCOC Investor or its designated representative in connection with the
matters on which it is consulted as described above in this _Section_ __ _
3.3_, recognizing that the ultimate discretion with respect to all
such matters shall be retained by the Company.

(c) In the event a VCOC Investor or any of its Affiliates Transfers all or any
portion of their investment in the Company to an Affiliated entity that is
intended to qualify its investment in the Company as a "venture capital
investment" (as defined in the Plan Asset Regulation), such Transferee shall
be afforded the same rights with respect to the Company afforded to the VCOC
Investor hereunder and shall be treated, for such purposes, as a third party
beneficiary hereunder.

 

(d) In the event that the Company ceases to qualify as an "operating company"
(as defined in the first sentence of 2510.3-101(c)(1) of the Plan Asset
Regulation), or the investment in the Company by a VCOC Investor does not
qualify as a "venture capital investment" as defined in the Plan Asset
Regulation, then the Company and each Principal Shareholder will cooperate in
good faith and take all reasonable actions necessary, subject to applicable
Law, to preserve the VCOC status of each VCOC Investor or the qualification of
the investment as a "venture capital investment," it being understood that
such reasonable actions shall not require a VCOC Investor to purchase or sell
any investments.

 

(e) For so long as the VCOC Investor, directly or through one or more
subsidiaries, continues to hold any Common Shares (or other securities of the
Company into which such Common Shares may be converted or for which such
Common Shares may be exchanged) and upon the written request of such VCOC
Investor, without limitation or prejudice of any of the rights provided to the
Principal Shareholders hereunder, the Company shall, with respect to each
such VCOC Investor, furnish and deliver a letter covering the matters set
forth in _Sections 3.3(a)_ , _3.3(b)_ , _3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)_ hereof in a form
and substance satisfactory to such VCOC Investor.

 



12

    

(f) In the event a VCOC Investor is an Affiliate of a Principal Shareholder,
as described in  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_ above, such affiliated entity shall
be afforded the same rights with respect to the Company and afforded to the
Principal Shareholder under this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and shall be treated,
for such purposes, as a third party beneficiary hereunder.

3.4 _Confidentiality_. Each Principal Shareholder agrees that it will,
and will direct its designated representatives to, keep confidential and not
disclose any Confidential Information; _provided,_ _however_ , that such
Principal Shareholder and its designated representatives may disclose
Confidential Information to the other Principal Shareholders, to the
Shareholder Designees and to (a) its Affiliates and its Affiliates attorneys,
accountants, consultants, insurers, financing sources and other advisors in
connection with such Principal Shareholders investment in the Company, (b)
any Person, including a prospective purchaser of Common Shares, as long as
such Person has first agreed, in writing, to maintain the confidentiality of
such Confidential Information, (c) any of such Principal Shareholders or its
respective Affiliates partners, members, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees or agents who have the need to know such Confidential Information
(the Persons referenced in clauses (a), (b) and (c), a Principal
Shareholders "designated representatives") or (d) as the Company may
otherwise consent in writing; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that each
Principal Shareholder agrees to be responsible for any breaches of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_ by such Principal Shareholders designated
representatives.

 

3.5 _Information Sharing_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that
Shareholder Designees may share any information concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries received by them from or on behalf of the Company or its
designated representatives with each Principal Shareholder and its designated
representatives (subject to such Principal Shareholders obligation to
maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_).

the Blackstone Investors or the FTAC Investors, as applicable.

(b) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the failure nor
delay on the part of any party hereto to exercise any right, remedy, power or
privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy power or privilege
preclude any other or further exercise of the same or of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any waiver of any right, remedy, power
or privilege with respect to any occurrence be construed as a waiver of such
right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to any other occurrence.

(c) No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, right, remedy, power or privilege is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in in the specific instance in which it is given.

(d) Each Principal Shareholder, in such Principal Shareholders sole

the Company. Thereafter, such Principal Shareholder shall cease to be a party
to this Agreement, shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder and
none of the terms or provisions hereof shall have any continuing force and
effect with respect to such Principal Shareholder; provided, that until the

were a party hereto.

reasonably be expected to result in, any Principal Shareholder being deprived
of the rights contemplated by this Agreement.

_however_ , that each Principal Shareholder may, without the consent of the
Company or any other Person, assign its rights and obligations under Section
2.2 of this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Transferee of Common
Shares so long as (i) any right to designate Directors to the Board will not
result in the Transferee receiving the right to designate more than two
Directors where such designation rights would result in the
Transferee receiving the right to designate a percentage of the Total

 



16

    

 Number of Directors that is greater than the percentage of the aggregate
outstanding Common Shares held by such Transferee after giving effect to such
Transfer and (ii) such Transferee, if not already a party to this Agreement,
executes and delivers to the Company a joinder to this Agreement evidencing
its agreement to become a party to and to be bound by certain or all, as
applicable, of the provisions of this Agreement as a "CVC Investor" or
"Blackstone Investor," as applicable, hereunder, whereupon such Transferee
shall be deemed a "CVC Investor" or "Blackstone Investor," as applicable,
hereunder. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding on the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

sufficient service thereof. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO

TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM OR ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING

5.9 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that in
the event of any breach of this Agreement by any of them, the other parties
hereto would be irreparably harmed and could not be made whole by monetary

under the Securities Act all or any portion of its Registrable Securities
pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form F-1, S-1 or any successor form
thereto with respect to a underwritten public offering of Registrable
Securities (each, a "Long-Form Registration"). Each request for a Long-Form
Registration shall

 



3

    

 specify the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in the
Long-Form Registration. Upon receipt of any such request, the Company shall
promptly (but in no event later than 10 days following receipt thereof)
deliver notice of such request to all other holders of Registrable Securities
who shall then have 10 days from the date such notice is given to notify the
Company in writing of their desire to be included in such registration. The
Company shall prepare and file with (or confidentially submit to) the
Commission a Registration Statement on Form F-1, S-1 or any successor
form thereto covering all of the Registrable Securities that the holders
thereof have requested to be included in such Long-Form Registration within 60
days after the date on which the initial request is given and shall use its
best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective by
the Commission as soon as practicable thereafter.

(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable, but in any event within forty-
five (45) days after the Closing Date, file (or confidentially submit) a
Registration Statement to permit the public resale of all the Registrable
Securities held by the Investors from time to time as permitted by Rule 415
under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the
Commission then in effect) on the terms and conditions specified in this _
Section 2(b)_ and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable after
the filing thereof, but in no event later than the earlier of (i) the 105th
day (or 165th day if the Commission notifies the Company that it will
"review" the Registration Statement) following the Closing Date and (ii) the
10th business day after the date the Company is notified (orally or in
writing, whichever is earlier) by the Commission that the Registration
Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not be subject to further review
(such earlier date, the "Effectiveness Deadline"). The Registration Statement
filed with the Commission pursuant to this _ Section 2(b)_ shall be on Form
F-3 or S-3, or if Form F-3 or S-3 is not then available to the Company, on
Form F-1 or S-1 or such other form of registration statement as is then
available to effect a registration for the sale or resale of such Registrable
Securities on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act or any successor rule or provision similar thereto adopted by
the Commission, covering such Registrable Securities, and shall contain a
Prospectus in such form as to permit any Investor to sell such Registrable
Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor
rule or similar provision adopted by the Commission then in effect) at any
time beginning on the effective date for such Registration Statement. A
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _ Section 2(b)_ shall provide
for the sale or resale pursuant to any method or combination of methods
legally available to, and requested by, the Investors. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause a Registration Statement filed pursuant
to Section 2(b) to remain effective, and to be supplemented and amended to
the extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is available
or, if not available, that another Registration Statement or Shelf
Registration Statement is continuously available, for the resale of all
the Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable
Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. As soon as practicable
following the effective date of a Registration Statement filed pursuant to
this _ Section 2(b)_, but in any event within one (1) business day of such
date, the Company shall notify the Investors of the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. If, after the filing such Registration Statement, a
holder of Registrable Securities requests registration under the Securities
Act of additional Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement, the Company shall amend such Registration Statement to cover such
additional Registrable Securities.

 

(c) The Company shall use its best efforts to qualify and remain qualified to
register the offer and sale of securities under the Securities Act pursuant
to a Registration Statement on Form F-3, S-3 or any successor form thereto. As
soon as practicable after the date hereof, but not later than the Target
Filing Date, the Company shall (i) prepare and file with (or confidentially
submit to) the Commission a Registration Statement on Form F-3 , S-3 or the
then appropriate form for an offering to be made on a delayed or continuous
basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any successor rule
thereto (a "Shelf Registration Statement") that covers all
Registrable Securities then outstanding for an offering to be made on a
delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act or
any successor rule thereto (a "Shelf Registration") and (ii) use its best
efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective
by the Commission as soon as practicable thereafter. In addition, the Company
shall use its best efforts to cause a Shelf Registration Statement filed
pursuant to Section 2(c) to remain effective, and to be supplemented and
amended to the extent necessary

 



4

    

 to ensure that such Shelf Registration Statement is available or, if not
available, that another Shelf Registration Statement (if the Company is
eligible to file a Shelf Registration Statement) or other Registration
Statement (if the Company is not so eligible) is continuously available, for
the resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all
such Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities.
For purposes hereof, "Target Filing Date" shall mean the date which is 30
days after the Company becomes qualified to register the offer and sale of
securities under the Securities Act pursuant to a Shelf Registration
Statement. If, after the filing of a Shelf Registration Statement, a holder
of Registrable Securities requests registration under the Securities Act of
additional Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration, the
Company shall amend such Shelf Registration Statement to cover such
additional Registrable Securities. At such time as the Company shall have
qualified for the use of a Registration Statement on Form F-3, S-3 or any
successor form thereto, the holders of Registrable Securities shall have the
right to request an unlimited number of registrations under the Securities Act
of all or any portion of their Registrable Securities pursuant to a
Registration Statement on Form F-3, S-3 or any similar short-form Registration
Statement (each, a "Short-Form Registration" and, collectively with each
Long-Form Registration and Shelf Registration (as defined below), a "Demand
Registration"). Each request for a Short-Form Registration shall specify the
number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in the Short-Form
Registration. Upon receipt of any such request, the Company shall promptly
(but in no event later than 10 days following receipt thereof) deliver notice
of such request to all other holders of Registrable Securities who shall then
have 10 days from the date such notice is given to notify the Company in
writing of their desire to be included in such registration. The Company shall
prepare and file with (or confidentially submit to) the Commission a
Registration Statement on Form F-3, S-3 or any successor form thereto
covering all of the Registrable Securities that the holders thereof have
requested to be included in such Short-Form Registration within 30 days after
the date on which the initial request is given and shall use its best efforts
to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective by the
Commission as soon as practicable thereafter.

 

(d) At any time that a Shelf Registration Statement is effective, if a holder
of Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement
delivers a notice to the Company (a "Shelf Takedown Notice") stating that the
holder intends to effect an offering of all or part of its Registrable
Securities included in such Shelf Registration Statement (a "Shelf Takedown")
and the Company is eligible to use such Shelf Registration Statement for such
Shelf Takedown, then the Company shall take all actions reasonably required,
including amending or supplementing (a "Shelf Supplement") such Shelf
Registration Statement, to enable such Registrable Securities to be offered
and sold as contemplated by such Shelf Takedown Notice. Each Shelf Takedown
Notice shall specify the number of Registrable Securities to be offered and
sold under the Shelf Takedown. Upon receipt of a Shelf Takedown Notice, the
Company shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5) business days, or,
in the case of an underwritten overnight "block trade", two (2) business
days, following receipt thereof) deliver notice of such Shelf Takedown Notice
to all other holders of Registrable Securities who shall then have five (5)
business days, or, in the case an underwritten overnight "block trade," one
(1) business day, from the date such notice is given to notify the Company in
writing of their desire to be included in such Shelf Takedown. The Company
shall prepare and file with the Commission a Shelf Supplement as soon as
practicable after the date on which it received the Shelf Takedown Notice and,
if such Shelf Supplement is an amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement,
shall use its best efforts to cause such Shelf Supplement to be declared
effective by the Commission as soon as practicable thereafter.

(e) The Company shall not be obligated to effect any Long-Form Registration
(x) within 90 days after the effective date of a previous Long-Form
Registration or Shelf Takedown or a previous Piggyback Registration in which
holders of Registrable Securities were permitted to register the offer and
sale under the Securities Act, and actually sold, all of the shares of
Registrable Securities requested to be included therein (y) or while a lock-up
agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4_ or any other lock-up agreement
relating to such holders Registrable Securities is in effect. Notwithstanding
anything otherwise to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be required
to provide notice of any requested underwritten public offering to any holders
of Registrable Securities whose shares are subject to any applicable lock-up
arrangements at the time of such request, and any such holders shall not have
the right to receive information on or participate in any such underwritten
public offering.

 



5

    

 The Company may postpone for up to 90 days the filing or effectiveness of a
Registration Statement for a Demand Registration or the filing of a Shelf
Supplement for a Shelf Takedown if the Board determines in its reasonable
good faith judgment that such Demand Registration or Shelf Takedown would (i)
materially interfere with a significant acquisition, corporate reorganization,
financing, securities offering or other similar transaction involving the
Company; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that the
Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or
(iii) render the Company unable to comply with requirements under the
Securities Act or Exchange Act. The Company may delay a Demand Registration or
Shelf Takedown pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence only once in any
period of 12 consecutive months.

 

(f) If the holders of the Registrable Securities initially requesting a Demand
Registration or Shelf Takedown elect to distribute the Registrable Securities
covered by their request in an underwritten offering, they shall so advise the
Company as a part of their request made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2(b)_,  _Section 2(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2(d)_, and the
Company shall include such information in its notice to the other holders of
Registrable Securities. The holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities initially requesting the Demand Registration or Shelf Takedown
shall select the investment banking firm or firms to act as the managing
underwriter or underwriters in connection with such offering.

 

(g) The Company shall not include in any Demand Registration or Shelf Takedown
any securities which are not Registrable Securities without the prior written
consent of the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in
such Demand Registration or Shelf Takedown, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If a Demand Registration or Shelf Takedown
involves an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter of the
requested Demand Registration or Shelf Takedown advises the Company and the
holders of Registrable Securities in writing that in its reasonable and good
faith opinion the number of shares of Equity Securities proposed to be
included in the Demand Registration or Shelf Takedown, including all
Registrable Securities and all other shares of Equity Securities proposed to
be included in such underwritten offering, exceeds the number of shares of
Equity Securities which can be sold in such underwritten offering and/or the
number of shares of Equity Securities proposed to be included in such Demand
Registration or Shelf Takedown would adversely affect the price per share of
the Equity Securities proposed to be sold in such underwritten offering, the
Company shall include in such Demand Registration or Shelf Takedown (i) first,
the shares of Equity Securities that the holders of Registrable Securities
propose to sell, and (ii) second, the shares of Equity Securities proposed to
be included therein by any other Persons (including shares of Equity
Securities to be sold for the account of the Company and/or other holders of
Equity Securities) allocated among such Persons in such manner as they may
agree. If the managing underwriter determines that less than all of the
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold can be included in such offering,
then the Registrable Securities that are included in such offering shall be
allocated pro rata among the respective holders thereof on the basis of the
number of Registrable Securities owned by each such holder.

 

3. _Piggyback Registration_. 

 

(a) Whenever the Company proposes to offer or sell any shares of its Equity
Securities pursuant to a registered offering under the Securities Act (other
than a registration (i) pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or
other registration solely relating to an offering or sale to employees or
directors of the Company pursuant to any employee share plan or other
employee benefit arrangement), (ii) pursuant to a Registration Statement on
Form F-4, S-4 (or similar form that relates to a transaction subject to Rule
145 under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto), or (iii) in
connection with any dividend or distribution reinvestment or similar plan),
whether for its own account or for the account of one or more shareholders of
the Company and the form of Registration Statement (a "Piggyback Registration
Statement") to be used may be used for any registration of Registrable
Securities (a "Piggyback Registration"), the Company shall give prompt
written notice (in any event no later than ten (10) business days prior to
either the filing of such Registration Statement or, with respect to a
Piggyback Shelf Takedown, the filing of a prospectus supplement to the
applicable Piggyback Shelf Registration Statement) to the holders of
Registrable Securities of its intention to effect such

 



6

    

 a registration and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 3(b)_ and _Section_ __ _
3(c)_, shall include in such registration all Registrable Securities with
respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion from
the holders of Registrable Securities within five (5) business days after the
Companys notice has been given to each such holder. A Piggyback Registration
shall not be considered a Demand Registration for purposes of _Section 2_.
If any Piggyback Registration Statement pursuant to which holders of
Registrable Securities have registered the offer and sale of Registrable
Securities is a Registration Statement on Form F-3, S-3 or the then
appropriate form for an offering to be made on a delayed or continuous basis
pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto
(a "Piggyback Shelf Registration Statement"), such holder(s) shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to be notified of and to participate in any
offering under such Piggyback Shelf Registration Statement (a "Piggyback
Shelf Takedown").

(b) If a Piggyback Registration or Piggyback Shelf Takedown is initiated as a
primary underwritten offering on behalf of the Company and the managing
underwriter advises the Company and the holders of Registrable Securities (if
any holders of Registrable Securities have elected to include Registrable
Securities in such Piggyback Registration or Piggyback Shelf Takedown) in
writing that in its reasonable and good faith opinion the number of shares of
Equity Securities proposed to be included in such registration or takedown,
including all Registrable Securities and all other shares of Equity
Securities proposed to be included in such underwritten offering, exceeds the
number of shares of Equity Securities which can be sold in such offering
and/or that the number of shares of Equity Securities proposed to be included
in any such registration or takedown would adversely affect the price per
share of the Equity Securities to be sold in such offering, the Company shall
include in such registration or takedown (i) first, the shares of Equity
Securities that the Company proposes to sell; (ii) second, the shares of
Equity Securities requested to be included therein by holders of Registrable
Securities, allocated pro rata among all such holders on the basis of the
number of Registrable Securities owned by each such holder or in such manner
as they may otherwise agree; and (iii) third, the shares of Equity Securities
requested to be included therein by holders of Equity Securities other than
holders of Registrable Securities, allocated among such holders in such
manner as they may agree.

(c) If a Piggyback Registration or Piggyback Shelf Takedown is initiated as
an underwritten offering on behalf of a holder of Equity Securities other than
Registrable Securities, and the managing underwriter advises the Company in
writing that in its reasonable and good faith opinion the number of shares of
Equity Securities proposed to be included in such registration or takedown,
including all Registrable Securities and all other shares of Equity Securities
proposed to be included in such underwritten offering, exceeds the number of
shares of Equity Securities which can be sold in such offering and/or that the
number of shares of Equity Securities proposed to be included in any such
registration or takedown would adversely affect the price per share of the
Equity Securities to be sold in such offering, the Company shall include in
such registration or takedown (i) first, the shares of Equity Securities
requested to be included therein by the holder(s) requesting such registration
or takedown and by the holders of Registrable Securities, allocated pro rata
among all such holders on the basis of the number of shares of Equity
Securities other than the Registrable Securities (on a fully diluted, as
converted basis) and the number of Registrable Securities, as applicable,
owned by all such holders or in such manner as they may otherwise agree; and
(ii) second, the shares of Equity Securities requested to be included therein
by other holders of Equity Securities, allocated among such holders in such
manner as they may agree.

(d) If any Piggyback Registration or Piggyback Shelf Takedown is initiated as
a primary underwritten offering on behalf of the Company, the Company shall,
subject to the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities included in such Piggyback Registration or Piggyback
Shelf Takedown, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
select the investment banking firm or firms to act as the managing underwriter
or underwriters in connection with such offering.

 

4. _Lock-up Agreement_. In connection with any registered offering of the Equity Securities or other equity securities of the Company, and upon the request of the managing underwriter in such offering, each holder of Registrable Securities agrees to execute a customary lock-up agreement. The Company shall cause its executive officers and its directors, which directors are selling Equity Securities in such offering (as applicable) and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause other holders of Equity Securities who beneficially own (within the meaning of Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the date of this Agreement) 10% or more of the then outstanding Equity Securities and holders of any of the Registrable Securities participating in such offering, to enter into lock-up agreements that contain restrictions that are no less restrictive than the restrictions contained in the lock-up agreements executed by the holders of Registrable Securities. Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees to execute 

 



7

    

 and deliver such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the
Company or the managing underwriter which are consistent with the foregoing or
which are necessary to give further effect thereto. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4_, each holder of
Registrable Securities shall be released, pro rata, from any lock-up agreement
entered into pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4_ in the event and to the
extent that the managing underwriter or the Company permit any discretionary
waiver or termination of the restrictions of any lock-up agreement pertaining
to any officer, director or holder of greater than 10% of the outstanding
Equity Securities.

 

5. _Registration Procedures_. If and whenever the holders of Registrable Securities request that the offer and sale of any Registrable Securities be registered under the Securities Act or any Registrable Securities be distributed in a Shelf Takedown pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall use its best efforts to effect the registration of the offer and sale of such Registrable Securities under the Securities Act in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall as soon as practicable and as applicable: 

 

(a) subject to _Section_ __ _ 2_ _(a)_ , _Section_ __ _ 2(b)_,  _Section_
__ _ 2(c)_ and _Section 2(d)_, (i) prepare and file with the Commission a

efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective; and
(ii) if (A) the Company has filed a Registration Statement (the "Initial
Registration Statement") with the Commission that covers Registrable
Securities (the "Initial Registrable Securities"), (B) pursuant to Rule
415(a)(5) under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto, the Initial
Registration Statement may no longer be used for offers and sales of any of
the Initial Registrable Securities, and (C) any of the Initial Registrable
Securities are Registrable Securities at the time that (B) above occurs, the
Company shall prepare and file with the Commission within the time limits
required by Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto a
new Registration Statement covering any Initial Registrable Securities that
have not ceased to be Registrable Securities for an offering to be made on a
delayed on continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act or
any successor rule thereto (a "New Registration Statement") and shall use its
best efforts to cause such New Registration Statement to be declared effective
by the Commission as soon as practicable thereafter;

 

(b) (i) in the case of a Long-Form Registration or a Short-Form Registration,
prepare and file with the Commission such amendments, post-effective
amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement effective for a period of not less than 180 days, or if earlier,
until all of such Registrable Securities have been disposed of and to comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended methods of

a Shelf-Registration, prepare and file with the Commission such amendments,

Statement and (ii) the date on which all the Registrable Securities subject

Securities copies of such documents proposed to be filed, which documents
shall be subject to the review, comment and approval of such counsel;

 

(d) notify each selling holder of Registrable Securities, promptly after the

8

    

(e) furnish to each selling holder of Registrable Securities such number of
copies of the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including

order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by
such seller;

 

(f) use its best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Securities

_provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do
business, subject itself to general taxation or consent to general service of

but for this _Section_ __ _ 5(f)_;

(g) notify each selling holder of such Registrable Securities, at any time
when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the happening of any event that would cause the Prospectus
included in such Registration Statement to contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit any fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and, at the request of any such holder, the Company shall prepare
a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered
to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such Prospectus shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading;

(h) make available for inspection by any selling holder of Registrable
Securities, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such
Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by
any such holder or underwriter (collectively, the "Inspectors"), all
financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of
the Company (collectively, the "Records"), and cause the Companys officers,
directors and employees to supply all information requested by any such
Inspector in connection with such Registration Statement;

 

(i) provide a transfer agent and registrar (which may be the same entity) for
all such Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of such
registration;

(j) use its best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be listed on
each securities exchange on which the Equity Securities is then listed or, if
the Equity Securities is not then listed, on a national securities exchange
selected by the holders of a majority of such Registrable Securities;

 

(k) in connection with an underwritten offering, enter into such customary
agreements (including underwriting and lock-up agreements in customary form)
and take all such other customary actions as the holders of such Registrable
Securities or the managing underwriter of such offering request in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities
(including, without limitation, making appropriate officers of the Company
available to participate in "road show" and other customary marketing
activities (including one-on-one meetings with prospective purchasers of the
Registrable Securities));

 

(l) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission and make available to its shareholders an
earnings statement (in a form that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a)

rule thereto) no later than 30 days after the end of the 12-month period
beginning with the first day of the Companys first full fiscal quarter after
the effective date of such Registration Statement, which earnings statement
shall cover said 12-month period, and which requirement will be deemed to be
satisfied if the Company timely files complete and accurate information on
Forms 20-F, 6-K, 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, as applicable, under the Exchange Act and
otherwise complies with Rule 158 under the Securities Act or any successor
rule thereto; and

 



9

    

(m) furnish to each selling holder of Registrable Securities and
each underwriter, if any, with (i) a written legal opinion of the Companys
outside counsel, dated the closing date of the offering, in form and substance
as is customarily given in opinions of the Companys counsel to underwriters
in underwritten registered offerings; and (ii) on the date of the applicable
Prospectus, on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the

the respective dates of delivery thereof, a "comfort" letter signed by the
Companys independent certified public accountants in form and substance as is
customarily given in accountants letters to underwriters in underwritten
registered offerings; 

(n) without limiting _Section_ __ _ 5(f)_, use its best efforts to cause such
Registrable Securities to be registered with or approved by such other
governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the
business and operations of the Company to enable the holders of such
Registrable Securities to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with their intended method of distribution thereof;

 

(o) notify the holders of Registrable Securities promptly of any request by

(p) advise the holders of Registrable Securities, promptly after it shall

6. _Expenses_. All expenses (other than Selling Expenses) incurred by the Company in complying with its obligations pursuant to this Agreement and in connection with the registration and disposition of Registrable Securities shall be paid by the Company, including, without limitation, all (i) registration and filing fees (including, without limitation, any fees relating to filings required to be made with, or the listing of any Registrable Securities on, any securities exchange or over-the-counter trading market on which the Registrable Securities are listed or quoted); (ii) underwriting expenses (other than fees, commissions or discounts); (iii) expenses of any audits incident to or required by any such registration; (iv) fees and expenses of complying with securities and "blue sky" laws (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company in connection with "blue sky" qualifications or exemptions of the Registrable Securities); (v) printing expenses; (vi) messenger, telephone and delivery expenses; (vii) fees and expenses of the Companys counsel and accountants; (viii) Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. filing fees (if any); and (ix) fees and expenses of one counsel for the holders of Registrable Securities participating in such registration as a group (selected by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in the registration). In addition, the Company shall be responsible for all of its internal expenses incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties) and the expense of any annual audits. All Selling Expenses relating to the offer and sale of Registrable Securities registered under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne and paid by the holders of such Registrable Securities, in proportion to the number of Registrable Securities included in such registration for each such holder. 

 

7. _Indemnification_. 

 

(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, each holder of Registrable Securities, such holders
officers, directors, managers, members, partners, shareholders and Affiliates,
each underwriter, broker or any other Person acting on behalf of such holder
of Registrable Securities and each other Controlling Person, if any, who
controls any of the foregoing Persons, against all losses, claims, actions,
damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several, to which any of the
foregoing Persons may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, actions, damages, liabilities or expenses
arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus, preliminary
Prospectus, free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act or any successor rule thereto) or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the case of a Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus or free writing prospectus,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; and
shall reimburse such Persons for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, action, damage or liability, except insofar as
the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to
the Company by such holder expressly for use therein or by such holders
failure to deliver a copy of the Registration Statement, Prospectus,
preliminary Prospectus, free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto) or any amendments or
supplements thereto (if the same was required by applicable law to be so
delivered) after the Company has furnished such holder with a sufficient
number of copies of the same prior to any written confirmation of the sale
of Registrable Securities. This indemnity shall be in addition to any
liability the Company may otherwise have.

(b) In connection with any registration in which a holder of Registrable
Securities is participating, each such holder shall furnish to the Company in
writing such information as the Company reasonably requests for use in
connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and, to the
extent permitted by law, shall indemnify and hold harmless, the Company, each
director of the Company, each officer of the Company who shall sign such
Registration Statement, each underwriter, broker or other Person acting on
behalf of the holders of Registrable Securities and each Controlling Person
who controls any of the foregoing Persons against any losses, claims, actions,
damages, liabilities or expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement,
Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus, free writing prospectus (as defined in
Rule 405 under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto) or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission
of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus or
free writing 

 



11

    

 prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is
contained in any information so furnished in writing by such holder;
_provided_ , that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and
several, for each holder and shall not exceed an amount equal to the net
proceeds (after underwriting fees, commissions or discounts)
actually received by such holder from the sale of Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement. This indemnity shall be in addition
to any liability the selling holder may otherwise have.

 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the
commencement of any action involving a claim referred to in this _Section_ __
_ 7_, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is made
against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the
commencement of such action. The failure of any indemnified party to notify
an indemnifying party of any such action shall not (unless such failure shall
have a material adverse effect on the indemnifying party) relieve the
indemnifying party from any liability in respect of such action that it may
have to such indemnified party hereunder. In case any such action is brought
against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate in and to assume the defense of the claims in any such action that
are subject or potentially subject to indemnification hereunder, jointly with
any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may
wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and
after written notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of
its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall
not be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, that,
if (i) any indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be
one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified party
which are additional to or conflict with those available to the indemnifying
party, or that such claim or litigation involves or could have an effect upon
matters beyond the scope of the indemnity provided hereunder, or (ii) such
action seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any indemnified
party or involves actual or alleged criminal activity, the indemnifying party
shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of
such indemnified party without such indemnified partys prior written consent
(but, without such consent, shall have the right to participate therein with
counsel of its choice) and such indemnifying party shall reimburse such
indemnified party and any Controlling Person of such indemnified party for
that portion of the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the
indemnified party which is reasonably related to the matters covered by the
indemnity provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party is not entitled to, or
elects not to, assume the defense of a claim, it shall not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified
by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the
reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist
between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with
respect to such claim. In such instance, the conflicting indemnified parties
shall have a right to retain one separate counsel, chosen by the holders of a
majority of the Registrable Securities included in the registration, at the
expense of the indemnifying party.

(d) If the indemnification provided for hereunder is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect
to any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then the
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder,
shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the
one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability
or action as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; _provided_
, that the maximum amount of liability in respect of such contribution shall
be limited, in the case of each holder of Registrable Securities, to an amount
equal to the net proceeds (after underwriting fees, commissions or discounts)
actually received by such seller from the sale of Registrable Securities
effected pursuant to such registration. The relative fault of the indemnifying
party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party,
whether the violation of the Securities Act or any other similar federal or
state securities laws or rule or regulation promulgated thereunder applicable
to the Company and relating to action

 



12

    

 or inaction required of the Company in connection with any applicable
registration, qualification or compliance was perpetrated by the indemnifying
party or the indemnified party and the parties relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant hereto were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method or allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to herein. No Person guilty or liable of fraudulent
misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities
Act shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

8. _Participation in Underwritten Registrations_. No Person may participate in any registration hereunder which is underwritten unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Persons securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Person or Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements; provided, that no holder of Registrable Securities included in any underwritten registration shall be required to make any representations or warranties to the Company or the underwriters (other than representations and warranties regarding such holder, such holders ownership of its shares of Equity Securities to be sold in the offering and such holders intended method of distribution) or to undertake any indemnification obligations to the Company or the underwriters with respect thereto, except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 7_. 

9. _Rule 144 Compliance_. 

 

(a) With a view to making available to the holders of Registrable Securities
the benefits of Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the Commission
that may at any time permit a holder to sell securities of the Company to the
public without registration, the Company shall:

 

(i) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144, at all times after the Registration Date;

(ii) use best efforts to file with the Commission in a timely manner all
reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, at any time after the Registration Date; and

 

(iii) furnish to any holder so long as the holder owns Registrable Securities,
promptly upon request, a written statement by the Company as to its
compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 and of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report
of the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed or furnished by
the Company as such holder may request in connection with the sale of
Registrable Securities without registration.

 

(b) In the event that shareholders of Pi Topco acquire Equity Securities in
respect of or on account of their shares in Pi Topco, whether by way of a
share dividend or share split or in exchange for or upon conversion of such
shares in Pi Topco or in connection with a combination of shares,
distribution, recapitalization, merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
other reorganization or other similar event at Pi Topco, and the recipients
of such Equity Securities would not be permitted to resell such Equity
Securities without the imposition of an additional holding period under Rule
144, the Company shall, as soon practicable thereafter, file with the
Commission (at the Companys sole cost and expense) a Registration Statement
(or a post-effective amendment or supplement to an existing Registration
Statement) and use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective (or the applicable post-effective
amendment or supplement, as applicable) as soon as practicable after the
filing thereof.

 

10. _Preservation of Rights_. The Company shall not (a) grant any registration rights to third parties which are more favorable than or inconsistent with the rights granted hereunder, or (b) enter into any agreement, take any action, or permit any change to occur, with respect to its securities that violates or subordinates the rights expressly granted to the holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement. 

 



13

    

11. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect when there shall no longer be any Registrable Securities outstanding; _provided_ , that the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6_ and _Section_ __ _ 7_ shall survive any such termination. 

 

12. _Notices_. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested); (c) on the date sent by facsimile or e-mail of a PDF document (with confirmation of transmission) if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next business day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient; or (d) on the fifth day after the date mailed, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. Such communications must be sent to the respective parties at the addresses indicated below (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 12_).

13. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. 

 

14. _Successor and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Each Investor may assign its rights hereunder to any purchaser or transferee of Registrable Securities; _provided_ , that such purchaser or transferee shall, as a condition to the effectiveness of such assignment, be required to execute a counterpart to this Agreement agreeing to be treated as an Investor whereupon such purchaser or transferee shall have the benefits of, and shall be subject to the restrictions contained in, this Agreement as if such purchaser or transferee was originally included in the definition of an Investor herein and had originally been a party hereto. 

15. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , however, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge that (i) the Persons set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7_ are express third-party beneficiaries of the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7_ _and (ii)_ __ _ the Francisco Partners Investors _are express third-party beneficiaries of the obligations of the Company hereto set forth in 9(b). 

16. _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. 

17. _Amendment, Modification and Waiver_. The provisions of this Agreement may only be amended, modified, supplemented or waived with the prior written consent of the Company and the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities; _provided_ , that any amendment or waiver that would materially adversely impact the rights of any Investor under this agreement in a manner different from the other Investors shall require the written consent of such Investor. No waiver by any party or parties shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

18. _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

 

19. _Remedies_. Each holder of Registrable Securities, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, shall be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and the Company hereby agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

 

20. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and any non-contractual rights or obligations arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 

 



15

    

The parties irrevocably agree that the state and federal courts located in the
State of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any Disputes,
and waive any objection to proceedings before such courts on the grounds of
venue or on the grounds that such proceedings have been brought in an
inappropriate forum.

 

For the purposes of this Section 20, "Dispute" means any dispute, controversy,
claim or difference of whatever nature arising out of, relating to, or having
any connection with this Agreement, including a dispute regarding the
existence, formation, validity, interpretation, performance or termination of
this Agreement or the consequences of its nullity and also including any
dispute relating to any non-contractual rights or obligations arising out of,
relating to, or having any connection with this Agreement.

 

21. _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Company will not, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted under or otherwise conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement. 

22. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement. 

 

23. _Further Assurances_. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, execute and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and to give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby.
