#### SECTION 2.01. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the
DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").

  

#### 

  

SECTION 2.02. _Effective Time; Closing_. As promptly as practicable after
the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing a certificate of merger or certificate of ownership and merger (the
" _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing of the
Certificate of Merger (or such later time as may be agreed by each of
the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "
_Effective Time_ "). Immediately prior to such filing of the Certificate of

  



        
   

  



  

Merger, a closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall be held at the
offices of Shearman and Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York
10022, or such other place as the parties shall agree, for the purpose of
confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions
set forth in _Article VIII_.

  



  

SECTION 2.03. _Effect of the Merger_. The effect of the Merger at and
following the Effective Time shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 2.04. _Conversion of Securities_. (a) _Conversion of Company Common
Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") (all
shares of Company Common Stock being collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to
be canceled or converted, as the case may be, in accordance with _Section
2.04(b)_) shall be converted into the right to receive a fraction of a
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Parent Common Share (the " _Per
Share Merger Consideration_ ") equal to the quotient (the " _Exchange Ratio_
") determined by dividing $56.00 by the Parent Share Value and rounding to
the nearest ten-thousandth of a share; _provided_ , that (x) if the
Parent Share Value is equal to or greater than $133.10, the Exchange Ratio
shall equal 0.4207, and (y) if the Parent Share Value is equal to or less
than $108.90, the Exchange Ratio shall equal 0.5142.

  



  

### (b) _Cancellation and Conversion of Certain Shares_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, (i) all Shares owned by the Company as treasury
stock and any Shares owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (including Merger Sub) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, automatically be canceled without any conversion
thereof and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor, and each holder of a certificate or
certificates representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, and (ii) each Share held by any Subsidiary immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of stock
of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same
percentage of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
(" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become one duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

SECTION 2.05. _Company Stock Options_. (a) All options (the " _Company
Stock Options_ ") outstanding, whether or not exercisable and whether or not
vested, at the Effective Time under the Company Stock Incentive Plan, as
amended, supplemented or modified (the " _Company Stock Option Plan_ "),
shall accelerate and remain outstanding following the Effective

  



        
   

  



  

Time. From and after the Effective Time, all references to the Company in the
Company Stock Option Plan and the applicable stock option agreements issued
thereunder shall be deemed to refer to Parent, which shall assume the Company
Stock Option Plan as of the Effective Time by virtue of this Agreement and
without any further action. Each Company Stock Option assumed by Parent
(each, a " _Substitute Option_ ") shall be fully vested and exercisable upon
the same terms and conditions as under the Company Stock Option Plan and the
applicable option agreement issued thereunder, except that (A) each such
Substitute Option shall be exercisable for, and represent the right
to acquire, that whole number of Parent Common Shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the number of Shares subject to such Company
Stock Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; and (B) the option price per
Parent Common Share shall be an amount equal to the option price per Share
subject to such Company Stock Option in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (the option price per share, as
so determined, being rounded upward to the nearest full cent).  Such
Substitute Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
as such Company Stock Option.

  



  

### (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute Option an
appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto and
such Substitute Option shall be fully vested and exercisable as described in
_Section 2.05(a)_ and shall otherwise continue in effect on the same terms
and conditions as such Company Stock Option. Parent shall comply with the
terms of all such Substitute Options and ensure, to the extent required by,
and subject to the provisions of, the Company Stock Option Plan, that
Substitute Options that qualified as incentive stock options under Section
422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive
stock options after the Effective Time. Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary, if any, to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
Parent Common Shares for delivery upon exercise of Substitute Options

SECTION 3.01. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with BNY Mellon Shareowner Services or another bank or trust
company selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares,

  



        
   

  



  

(i) for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ through the Exchange
Agent, certificates representing the Parent Common Shares issuable to holders
of Shares in the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.04_ as of the Effective Time,
(ii) immediately available funds, from time to time as required to make
payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_
and (iii) any cash or other consideration from time to time as required
for any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_
(such cash and certificates for Parent Common Shares, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Parent Common Shares contemplated to be
issued pursuant to _Section 2.04_, dividends or other distributions
contemplated to be delivered pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ and the cash in
lieu of fractional shares contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section
3.01(e)_ out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by _Section
3.01(g)_ hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. (i) As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person
who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares whose Shares
were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_: (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall be
in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent); and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to such letter of transmittal.

  

### 

  

##### (ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing
that number of whole Parent Common Shares which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate
(after taking into account all Shares then held by such holder), (B) cash in
lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_, and (C) any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_, and the
Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of Parent Common Shares, cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.01(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ may be delivered to a
transferee if the Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.01_, each Certificate shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the certificate representing Parent Common Shares, cash in
lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_.

  

##### 

        
   

  

### 

  

### (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to the Parent Common Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the Parent Common Shares represented thereby, and no cash
payment in lieu of any fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_, until the holder of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof).
 Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole Parent Common Shares issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount of any cash payable
with respect to any fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and
theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions,
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole
Parent Common Shares.

  

### 

  

### (d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Parent Common Shares
issued upon surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ and any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ or _Section
3.01(e)_ shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Parent. Each holder of a fractional share interest shall be paid an amount in
cash (without interest, rounded to the nearest whole cent and subject to the
amount of any withholding Taxes as contemplated in _Section 3.01(h)_) equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to
which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share
interests then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the
Parent Share Value. As promptly as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share
interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall
deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional share
interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of _Section 3.01(b)_
and  _Section 3.01(c)_.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Adjustments of Merger Consideration_. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Shares or Company Common Stock),
extraordinary cash dividends, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares
with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, the Parent Common Shares
(each, an " _Adjustment_ "), the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide the holders of Shares
with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
Adjustment.

  

### 

        
   

  

### 

  

### (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Shares for nine months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_
shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar laws) for the Per Share Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant
to _Section 3.01(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions with respect
to the Parent Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.01(c)_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any Per Share Merger Consideration (or dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares), or other cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Withholding Rights_.  Each of the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards,
Company Performance Share Awards or other interests in the Company such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign
Law relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company Performance Share Awards or other
interests in the Company in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the whole number of Parent Common Shares, any cash
in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_ and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.01(c)_.

  

### 

  

SECTION 3.02. _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be canceled
and converted in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_.

  



  

SECTION 3.03. _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Shares in
connection with the Merger.

As an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
except (i) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule (with specific
reference to the particular section or subsection of this Agreement to which
the information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule relates;
_provided_ , that any information set forth in one section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other
section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent);
and (ii) as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to
the SEC by the Company since December 31, 2006 and prior to the date hereof
(other than disclosures in the "Risk Factors" sections thereof or any
disclosures included in such filings that are cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature; _provided_ , that in no event shall any disclosure
contained in any such Company SEC Report be deemed to be an exception to any
representation or warranty contained in _Section 4.03(a)_ or  _Section
4.05(b)_, and it being understood that any matter set forth in the Company
SEC Reports shall be deemed to qualify any representation or warranty in this
_Article IV_ only to the extent that the description of such matter in the

laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite corporate
or similar power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except where the failure of any Subsidiary to be so

governmental approvals would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions where such concept is applicable), in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature

except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) _Section 4.01(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all of
the Subsidiaries of the Company in existence as of the date hereof (other
than Subsidiaries with immaterial amounts of assets, operations or

of each such Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding capital stock
or other equity interests of each such Subsidiary owned by the Company and

to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, the Company.

Subsidiarys voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any
nature whatsoever, except for limitations on transfer imposed by federal or
state securities Laws. There are no options, warrants, convertible debt or
other convertible instruments or other rights, agreements, arrangements or

contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate

obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL).  This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
its enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles. The Company
Board has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and such approvals are sufficient so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203(a) of the DGCL shall not apply to the
Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. To the knowledge of
the Company, no other state takeover statute is applicable to the Company
with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this

and other actions described in _Section 4.05(b)_ have been obtained, that
all filings and obligations described in _Section 4.05(b)_ have been made
and that the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, conflict with or
violate any United States or non-United States statute, law,
ordinance, regulation, rule, code, writ, executive order, injunction,
judgment, decree or other order (" _Law_ ") applicable to the Company or any
Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary
is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of, loss of any benefit
under, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of the
Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation, _except_ , with respect

  



        
   

  



  

to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

### (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not,
and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification

government, governmental, regulatory, Taxing or administrative authority,
agency, instrumentality or commission or any court, tribunal, or judicial or
arbitral body (a " _Governmental Authority_ "), except (i) for applicable
requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state
securities or "blue sky" laws (" _Blue Sky Laws_ ") and state takeover laws,

described in _Section 4.05(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and
filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the
DGCL, and except as may be required in connection with Taxes described in
_Section 7.12_ and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary for each of the Company or the Subsidiaries to own, lease and
operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have, or
the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Company Permits would not have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement,
no suspension or cancellation of any material Company Permit is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened.  Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (a)
any Law applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which any property
or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (b) any
Company Material Contract, except in either case for any such conflicts,

promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed, except to the
extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent Company SEC
Report filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company, and in either case,
publicly available prior to the date hereof (each, a " _Company Filed SEC

of the date of such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein

the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to

  



        
   

  



  

the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent Company
Filed SEC Report.  The Company is eligible to use Form S-3 in connection with
the registration of securities under the Securities Act. No Subsidiary is
required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC.

  



  

### (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (or if amended
prior to the date of this Agreement, as amended) was prepared in accordance

and the Code. The Company and the Subsidiaries have performed, in all
material respects, all obligations required to be performed by them under,
are not in any respect in default under or in violation of, and have no
knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any Company Plan. No
Action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with
respect to any Company Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary

401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received
a favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all of the
provisions applicable to the Company Plan for which determination letters are
currently available that the Company Plan is so qualified and each trust
established in connection with any Company Plan which is intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has

excise tax or liability.  To the knowledge of the Company, no fiduciary has
any material liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to
act or comply with the requirements of ERISA, the Code or any other
applicable Law. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any
liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other
than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
arising in the ordinary course), including any liability in connection with
(i) the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists which could give rise to
any such liability.

  

### 

  

### (i) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with
respect to any Company Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All
such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no
such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental

challenge or disallowance.

inventions made by them within the scope of their employment during such
employment and for a reasonable period thereafter.

  

### 

  

### (k) In addition to the foregoing, with respect to each Company Plan that
is not subject to United States law (a " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_ "):

  

### 

  

#### (i) all employer and employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan required by law or by the terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been
made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting
practices, except for any failure which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a material liability;

  

####

provide for the benefits determined on any ongoing basis (actual or
contingent) accrued to the date of this Agreement with respect to all current
and former participants under such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan according to the
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and no transaction contemplated
hereby shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such
benefit obligations, except, in either case, for any shortfall which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
material liability; and

  



        
   

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be registered has been
registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities, except for any failure which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability. Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan is now and always has been operated in
material compliance with all applicable non-United States laws.

  

#### 

  

### (l) The Company has no liabilities with respect to any misclassification
of any individual as an independent contractor, temporary employee or leased
employee and no independent contractor, temporary employee or leased employee
has been improperly excluded from any Company Plan, except for any failure
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a material liability.

  

### 

  

### (m) Each Company Plan that is subject to the requirements of Section
409A of the Code is in good faith compliance with the currently
applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations,
rulings and notices thereunder.

set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule (with specific reference to
the particular section or subsection of this Agreement to which the
information set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule relates; _provided_ ,
that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other section or
subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent); and (ii)
as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by
Parent since December 31, 2006 and prior to the date hereof (other than
disclosures in the "Risk Factors" sections thereof or any disclosures
included in such filings that are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking
in nature; provided, that in no event shall any disclosure contained in any
such Parent SEC Report be deemed to be an exception to any representation or
warranty contained in _Section 5.05(b)_, and it being understood that any
matter set forth in the Parent SEC Reports shall be deemed to qualify any
representation or warranty in this _Article V_ only to the extent that the
description of such matter in the Parent SEC Reports would be reasonably

necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such
power, authority and governmental approvals would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and each Parent Significant
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions where such
concept is applicable), in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business

legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its

respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any such conflicts, violations,

and Merger Sub will not, require any consent, approval, authorization

Form S-4 (together with all amendments thereto, the " _Registration
Statement_ ") in which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be included as a
prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of
the Parent Common Shares to be issued to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to the Merger. Parent and the Company each shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become

Agreement or the Merger (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), or take any
action, or make any public statement, filing or release inconsistent with the

with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to Parent and its
shareholders under applicable Law, in which event the Parent Board may make a
Change in Parent Recommendation, but only after (i) providing written notice
to the Company advising the Company of its intention to make a Change in
Parent Recommendation at least five (5) calendar days prior to effecting such
Change in Parent Recommendation and (ii) negotiating, and causing its
financial advisors and outside counsel to negotiate, with the Company in good
faith during such five-day period (to the extent the Company desires to

### 

  

### respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall
simultaneously provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company that may be provided (pursuant to _Section 7.05(b)_) to any other
person or group of persons in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which
was not previously provided to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
7.05_, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, if the Company
has received a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to the terms of any
revised offer by Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.05(d)_), the Company
Board may (x) in connection with such Superior Proposal, make a Change in
Company Recommendation or (y) terminate this Agreement for the purpose of
causing the Company to enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal (provided that the Company shall have paid the
Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.03(b)_), which the Company shall
enter into concurrently with or immediately following such termination, if
the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys financial advisors and outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary obligations to the Company and its stockholders under applicable
Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that if the Change in Company Recommendation pursuant to clause (x) or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to clause (y) is to be effected as a
result of a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may not take the
actions set forth in clause (x) or (y), as the case may be, unless:

  

### 

  

##### (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at
least five (5) calendar days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of its
intention to take such actions, which notice shall advise Parent that the
Company Board has received a Superior Proposal, specify the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and indicate that the Company Board
intends to effect a Change in Company Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement and the manner in which it intends (or may intend) to take such
action (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "), and

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) during the Notice Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial advisors and outside counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute (in the judgment of the Company Board) a Superior
Proposal.

  

##### 

  

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal,
the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent specifying the
details of any such revisions and shall comply with the requirements of this
_Section 7.05(d)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the
new Notice Period shall be two (2) calendar days. Any disclosure that the
Company Board may be compelled to make with respect to the receipt of a
proposal or offer for an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise in order to comply
with its fiduciary obligations to the Company and its stockholders under
applicable Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation or Rule 14d-9
or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act will not constitute a
violation of this Agreement; _provided_ , that such disclosure does not
violate any provision of this _Section 7.5(d)_ (it being understood that a
mere "stop, look and listen" disclosure shall not

  



        
   

  



  

violate this _Section 7.5(d)_ or constitute a Change in Company
Recommendation). Any Change in Company Recommendation shall not change the
approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any state takeover
statute or other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

### (e) Notwithstanding _Section 7.05(d)_, at any time prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, other than in response to a
Superior Proposal, make a Change in Company Recommendation if the Company
Board determines, in its good faith judgment prior to the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting and after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to make a Change in Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with
the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the Company and its
stockholders under applicable Law and the Companys certificate of
incorporation; _provided_ , that the Company Board may not take the actions
set forth in this _Section 7.05(e)_ unless prior thereto the Company shall
take the actions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 7.05(d)_ as
if a Superior Proposal had been received by the Company.

  

### 

  

### (f) An " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any
person or group of persons (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
affiliates): (i) for any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange,
business combination, scheme of arrangement, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or any
Subsidiary pursuant to which such person or group of persons would own 25% or
more of the voting power of any class of equity securities of the Company or
of any resulting parent of the Company; (ii) for any sale, lease, exchange,
transfer or other disposition of assets or businesses that constitute or
represent 25% or more of the consolidated revenue, consolidated operating
income or consolidated total assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; or (iii) for any sale, exchange, transfer or other
disposition pursuant to which such person or group of persons would own 25%
or more of the voting power of any class of equity securities of the Company,
in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, in each case
other than the Merger.

  

### 

  

### (g) A " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited written bona fide
offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following transactions:
(i) a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business
combination, asset purchase, scheme of arrangement, or other similar
transaction involving the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the
Company immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than 50% of
the voting power of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any
resulting entity of such transaction or the Company would sell more than 50%
of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries; or (ii) the
acquisition by any person or group (including by means of a tender offer or
an exchange offer or a two-step transaction involving a tender offer followed
with reasonable promptness by a cash-out merger involving the Company),
directly or indirectly, of ownership of 100% of the then outstanding shares
of stock of the Company, in each case on terms that the Company Board
determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors), to be more favorable to the Company stockholders than
the Merger (after taking into account, among other factors the Company Board
may deem relevant, the likelihood of obtaining any financing required to
consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer).

employment for any employee of the Company or their respective subsidiaries,
or to restrict the right of Parent or any of its subsidiaries to terminate or
cause to be terminated any employee at any time for any or no reason with or
without notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section

### following the Closing in accordance with its terms. Parent and the
Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section
7.06_ are included for the sole benefit of Parent and the Company, and that
nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other person, including any employees,
former employees, any participant in any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof), of the Company or any
of its affiliates or (ii) to continued employment with Parent or any of its

faith with the Company with a view to agreeing on a mechanism with respect to
employees of the Company who (i) hold Company Performance Share Awards with
respect to the 2006-2008 performance period and (ii) remain employees of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company) following the
Closing and through the applicable payment date, so that such employees are

indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses than are set forth
in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who,
at or at any time prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers,
employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or the Subsidiaries, unless
such modification shall be required by law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any claim or claims are asserted against any individual entitled to the

fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting
or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are not, in the aggregate, less favorable as the Companys existing policies

Company or any of the Subsidiaries by reason of his or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time

reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for
six years from the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance maintained by the
Company as of the date hereof (except the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing

favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend in the aggregate pursuant to this _Section 7.07(b)_ an annual amount
in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company (which
current amount is set forth in _Section 7.07(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance; _provided_ _further_ , that, if
the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or

Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance.

  

### 

  

### (c) In the event the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary, as the
case may be, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.07_.
