submit the following irrevocable and binding offer (the " _Put_ ") which AXA
Investment Managers Private Equity Europe ("AXA"), acting as (i) _soci ete de
gestion_ for AXA LBO Fund III-A and AXA LBO Fund III-B and (ii) Sellers
Agent, may, at its sole option, elect to accept in accordance with the
procedures and subject to the terms set out below, and whereby Omnova
Solutions Inc (or any of its Affiliates) (the " _Purchaser_ "), will, in
accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of the share
purchase agreement (together with its own schedules, appendices and exhibits)
attached hereto as _Exhibit 1_ (the " _Share Purchase Agreement_ "), acquire
all, and only all, of the Securities from the Sellers.

Capitalized terms used in this letter (the " _Letter_ ") shall, unless
otherwise defined herein, have the meanings ascribed to them in the Share
Purchase Agreement.



   1. | Duration and acceptance of the Put 
---|--- 

The Put will remain valid until the earlier of (i) 8:00 pm, Paris time, the
fifth Business Day after the date on which the central workers council (
_comit e central dentreprise_) of the Group Companies, following
its information and consultation, will have delivered its final opinion in
respect of the Transaction, and (ii) 8:00 pm, Paris time, December 20, 2010
(the " _Expiry Date_ ").

 

The Put will automatically terminate as at the Expiry Date, unless the Parties
mutually agree to postpone such date to a later date. This Put may be exercised and accepted by AXA in accordance with the
provisions of Article 3, on or prior to the Expiry Date.



   2. | Information and consultation of the central workers council 
---|--- 
 

Purchaser acknowledges that the contemplated acquisition of the Company by the
Purchaser is subject to the central workers council ( _comit e central
dentreprise_) of the Group Companies being informed and consulted on the
Transaction and delivering a final opinion on such Transaction.

 

By countersigning this letter, AXA undertakes to (i) cause the management of
the Group Companies to inform and consult the central workers council of the
Group Companies on the proposed Transaction as soon as practicable after the
date hereof and (ii) to regularly inform the Purchaser of the progress of the
information and consultation.

 

In this respect, Purchaser undertakes to co-operate, as may be reasonably
required by AXA, with AXA and the managers of the Group Companies, with
respect to the information and consultation of the central workers council
(including by providing the documents or information relating to the Purchaser
and its affiliates or its strategy relating to the Group Companies, which the
central workers council or the " _expert"_ appointed by the central workers
council, as the case may be, would reasonably request in connection only with
the contemplated change of control of the Group Companies and to
extent required by applicable laws).

From the date hereof and until execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, AXA
and the Sellers having countersigned this Letter will not be committed to
sell the Securities to the Purchaser and will not be bound by any obligation
in connection with this Transaction, with the exception of (i) all covenants
of Article 6 of the Share Purchase Agreement, (ii) the exclusivity
undertaking provided for under Clause 6 (" _Exclusivity_ ") of this Letter and
(iii) the other undertakings expressly provided for in this Letter.

 



   3. | Exercise of the Put - execution of the Share Purchase Agreement 
---|--- 
 

If AXA decides to accept and exercise the Put, it shall do so by sending to
Purchaser one copy of the Share Purchase Agreement executed by all the
Sellers before the Expiry Date.

Subject to the fulfillment of the Condition Precedent set out in Clause 5
below, if AXA exercises the Put as set forth above, Purchaser hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to execute the Share Purchase
Agreement within three (3) Business Days following the date of receipt by
Purchaser of the Share Purchase Agreement executed by the Sellers, it being
provided that any revocation from Purchaser of the Put before that date will
be without effect.



   4. | Antitrust Clearance 
---|--- 

To the extent permissible, Purchaser undertakes to initiate all necessary
filings, with the Required Antitrust Authorities as soon as reasonably
possible as from the date hereof.

 

By countersigning this Letter, AXA undertakes to fully cooperate and to cause
the Group Companies to cooperate with the Purchaser, in a timely fashion, in
providing such assistance as is reasonably necessary for the Purchaser to make
such filings.



 

\- 2 - ---|--- 

Purchasers undertaking set out in Clause 3 above is subject to the non
occurrence, before the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, of any
situation, transaction, development, event, circumstance, change, occurrence,
effect or fact that would prevent any of the conditions precedent referred to
in Article 5 of the Share Purchase Agreement (except for the financing
condition precedent referred to in Article 5.3.1) to be satisfied (the "
_Conditions Precedent_ "). For the sake of clarity, the Conditions Precedent
are intended for the exclusive benefit of the Purchaser and the Purchaser may,
at any time, waive by notice to AXA, the benefit of it.

 



   6. | Exclusivity 
---|--- 

In consideration for Purchasers irrevocable commitment hereunder, AXA agree
that, as from the date hereof and until December 31, 2010 included, AXA and
the Sellers (or any of their Affiliates, including any Group Companies) shall
not, directly or indirectly, continue or enter into any discussions or
negotiations with, or provide information to, any third party and/or enter
into any agreement, in both cases, for or in connection with the transfer, by
any means, of all or part of the Securities or any securities of the Group
Companies or substantial assets of the Group Companies, or the merger, spin-
off, contribution, business combination, or similar transaction involving the
Group Companies, other than with the Purchaser.

 



   7. | Deloittes fees 
---|--- 

We undertake to bear the Deloittes Fees (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, if the Condition Precedent is not satisfied), except if AXA decides not
to exercise the Put or if the non-satisfaction of the Condition Precedent is a
consequence of AXAs fault or breach of any of its obligations hereunder.



   8. | Governing law 
---|--- 

This Letter shall be exclusively governed by, construed in accordance with,
and enforced under, French law and all disputes, controversies or claims
arising out of, or in connection with, the existence, validity, interpretation
or performance of this letter shall be brought before the _Tribunal de
Commerce_ of Paris.

Yours faithfully,

---|---|--- 



     | 5.3.2 | Since the Put Date, there shall not have occurred or
become known any Material Adverse Effect; 
---|---|--- 
 



 

24 contained in this Agreement (other than those referred to in Article 5.3.4)
shall be true and correct on the Put Date and on the Closing Date (except to
the extent such representations and warranties shall have been expressly made
only as of a particular earlier date, in which case such representations and
warranties shall have been true and correct as of such earlier date) with the
same force and effect as if made on and as of the Closing Date, provided that
if an event occurring after the Put Date would cause any representation or
warranty of Seller to be not true and correct at the Closing then, prior to
the Closing, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser as soon as practicable
clear and fair written disclosure regarding such events (specifically pursuant
to this Article 5.3.3), and if such disclosure has been made, for purposes of
this Article 5.3.3 (and for no other purposes) such representation and
warranty shall be deemed to be true and correct at the Closing, but no such
disclosure by the Seller shall, without limitation, limit the Purchasers
rights under Article 5.3.2, and such disclosure shall be ignored for purposes
of Article 11 and 14. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.3.4 | The representations and warranties of the Sellers

sole benefit of the Purchaser and may under no circumstances be used or waived
by any of the Sellers. The Purchaser may (to the extent permitted by Law)

---|---|---

Stop Date, then, as a consideration for the undertaking of the Sellers not to
sell the Acquired Securities between the date of this Agreement and the Long
Stop Date, the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers a lump sum amount of seven
million euros ( 7,000,000) (the "Break-Up Indemnity"). In addition, and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time before the
Closing Date, the Purchaser may elect, on a purely discretionary basis, at any
time between the date hereof and the Long Stop Date, regardless of the
satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any of the conditions precedent set out in

monetary damages or otherwise, or owe any obligation to the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates hereunder or under the Commitment Letter dated as of
September 16, 2010 among the Purchaser and Deutche Bank Trust Company
Americas, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (the "Commitment Letter") or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or arising

Provisions has definitely proved to be unnecessary;

incurred by the relevant Group Company; any increased liability to _taxe sur
la valeur ajout ee_ will not be taken into account where such _taxe sur la

Loss actually and directly ( _certain et direct_ ) sustained, incurred or
suffered by the Purchaser or the Group Companies shall be taken into account,

imprevisible_). For the avoidance of doubt, no price/earnings or other
multiple which may be implicit in the Purchase Price shall be applied,

indemnification for Losses that will be repetitive or extended over a period
of time.

when the relevant breach relates to a Group Company having its jurisdiction
(for Tax purposes) in a country other than France; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date in relation
to all representations and warranties of the Sellers other than those referred
to above in this Article 14.6.2; 
---|---|--- 

(all such dates and expiration periods shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"Expiry Date").

The Expiry Date shall not affect the validity of any Claim that has been
notified to the Sellers Agent prior to such Expiry Date, regardless of the
fact that the amount of the potential Loss is not precisely known or
determined at that time.



     | 14.6.3 | If a Claim (other than related to a Third Party Claim) is
made before the Expiry Date and remain pending or challenged between the
Parties after the Expiry Date, it shall be deemed withdrawn three (3) months
after the Expiry Date unless judicial proceedings in respect of it have been
commenced between the Parties prior to the expiration of such a three (3)
month period. For the avoidance of doubt, any Claim made before the Expiry
Date in connection with a Third Party Claim shall survive until such Third
Party Claim is finally resolved. 
---|---|--- 



     | 14.7 | Maximum amount of Claims 
---|---|--- 
 

It is specifically agreed that all the limitations set forth in this Article
14.7 shall not apply to any Specific Loss nor to any Loss resulting from any
breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties referred to in
Articles 10, 11.1, 11.2 and 11.4(a).



     | 14.7.1 | _De minimis_ 
---|---|--- 
 

The Sellers shall not be liable under Article 14.1.1 or Article 14.1.2 in
respect of any Loss if the amount of any such Loss does not exceed 100,000,
provided that the Sellers shall be liable for the entire amount of the Loss if
the liability determined in respect of any such Loss exceeds such amount of
100,000, it being understood that a succession of similar events or facts
having a similar source or origin shall be considered as one single event or
fact for the purposes of calculation of this _de minimis_.



 

49 ---|---|--- 

The Sellers shall not be liable under Article 14.1.1 or Article 14.1.2 in
respect of any Loss unless and to the extent that the aggregate amount of all
Losses for which the Sellers would otherwise be liable under Article 14.1.1 or
Article 14.1.2 exceeds 1,000,000, provided that such amount shall constitute
a deductible ( _franchise_ ) and not a threshold ( _seuil de d eclenchement_).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Losses in respect of which the Sellers shall
not be liable pursuant to Article 14.7.1 shall not be taken into account for
the computation of this threshold.



     | 14.7.3 | General Cap 
---|---|--- 

Subject to the specific limitations provided in Article 14.7.4 below, the
Sellers aggregate liability under Article 14.1.1 or Article 14.1.2 in respect

be required to make any payment which would exceed such cap.

required to make any payment which would exceed such cap or the general cap
referred to in Article 14.7.3;  
---|---|---

Losses in connection with a breach or inaccuracy of Article 11.13 shall in no
event exceed 5,000,000, and the Sellers shall not be required to make any
payment which would exceed such cap or the general cap referred to in Article
14.7.3. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 14.8 | Payments 
---|---|--- 

The payment of any sum due by the Sellers under this Agreement will be made:



     | (i) | in connection with a Third Party Claim, within ten (10)
Business Days following (x) receipt by the Sellers Agent of a notice sent by
the Purchaser evidencing that the amount of the Third Party Claim is being
due and payable as a result of an immediately enforceable decision or as a
result of the execution of a settlement agreement or (y) in the event of a
disagreement between the Parties, the date of an immediately enforceable
decision rendered in accordance with Article 28 in respect of such
disagreement between the Parties; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | in connection with any other Claim, within ten (10)
Business Days following the acceptance (express or implied) of the Claim by
the Sellers Agent, or in the event of a disagreement between the Parties,
following the date of an immediately enforceable decision rendered in
accordance with Article 28 in respect of such disagreement between the
Parties. 
---|---|--- 
 



 

50 Any amount due by the Sellers under this Agreement and that is not paid within
the time periods set forth herein shall automatically and immediately bear
interest at a yearly rate of 10%. This provision shall be without prejudice to
any other Purchasers rights for indemnification or specific performance as a
result of such late payment.

If the Sellers pay an amount in discharge of any Claim under this Agreement
and the Purchaser or any Group Company subsequently recovers from a Third
Party an amount in respect of the same Loss, the Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Sellers Agent thereof and promptly pay on behalf of itself or of
the relevant Group Company, as the case may be, to the Sellers an amount
equal to the sum recovered from the Third Party.



     | 14.9 | Change of law 
---|---|--- 

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any Claim in respect of any Loss
or any part thereof, and shall not be indemnified in respect of any such Loss
or any part thereof, to the extent arising from or caused by the passing of,
or any change (even with a retroactive effect) in, any law, regulation
(including the Accounting Principles) or administrative practice after the
Closing Date, including (without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing)
any increase in the tax rates or any imposition of tax.



     | 14.10 | Action by the Purchaser and/or the Group Companies 
---|---|--- 
 

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to make a Claim for indemnification for
Losses resulting from the termination of the existing Tax consolidation
between the Company, Eliokem SAS, ELiokem China France Holding and Eliokem
India France Holding that would be decided by the Purchaser or the Group
Companies or result from the completion of the Transaction.

 



     | 14.11 | Mitigation of Loss 
---|---|--- 

The Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Group Companies shall, at the
Sellers expense, take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss
after becoming aware of any event or circumstance which could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Claim. In particular, the Purchaser undertakes to
claim, and shall procure that the relevant Group Company claims, under any
applicable insurance policy and/or warranty agreement in respect of the Loss
concerned and take reasonable steps to seek recovery in accordance with the
terms of such insurance policy and/or warranty agreement in a timely manner.
Failure by the Purchaser to comply with the provisions of this Article 14.11
shall have no consequence on the ability of the Purchaser to make a valid
Claim, and may be sanctioned solely by the payment of damages to the Sellers
to the extent of the amount of the damages caused to the Sellers directly by
such failure.

 



     | 14.12 | Exclusivity of remedy 
---|---|--- 
 

The indemnification provided for under this Article 14 shall be the exclusive
remedy of the Purchaser against the Sellers in respect of any breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Articles 10 and 11.



 

51 ---|--- 

In addition to the obligations provided under Article 14, the Sellers hereby
agree to indemnify the Purchaser of the entire amount of all costs, losses and
tax liabilities arising as a result of (i) the absence of filing of a
statement of latent capital gains ( _e tat de suivi des plus-values a long
terme_) following the 2007 merger between Eliokem Holding SAS and Eliokem
International SAS and (ii) the absence of any valid title of ownership on the
real properties referred to in Article 6.2.8 as well as any claim made by any
Third Party in that respect.

Any Loss resulting from the above mentioned item shall be referred to as a
"Specific Loss".

It is expressly agreed by the Sellers that the provisions of Article 14
(including the limitations and exclusions contained therein) will not apply to
the indemnification obligations of the Sellers relating to any Specific Loss,
with the exception of Article 14.5 relating to Claim notification and conduct
of Third Party Claims.

The Sellers aggregate liability under this Article 15 in respect of all
Specific Losses shall in no event exceed 4,500,000, and the Sellers shall
not be required to make any payment which would exceed such cap.

 

The amount of the Specific Losses shall be paid to the Purchaser on a euro for
euro basis within five (5) Business Days of receipt by the Sellers Agent of
a notification from the Purchaser that the Specific Loss has become due and
payable. The sums due by the Sellers in relation to any Specific Loss shall be
qualified as provided in Article 14.3.

 

The Sellers shall not be released, in all or in part, from their
indemnification obligations in connection with a Specific Loss by invoking
any lack of awareness of the facts in question or any knowledge that the
Purchaser has, may have or should have had of the facts giving rise to such
Specific Loss including as a result of any investigations made by the
Purchaser or any oral or written disclosure made during the due diligence,
the negotiations or in this Agreement or in the Schedules thereto, which
Schedules shall not exempt the Sellers from their liabilities for Specific
Losses.

 

No Claim shall give rise to an indemnification obligation of the Sellers in
connection with any Specific Loss if notice of such Claim is made after a
period of thirty (30) Business Days following the expiration of applicable
statute of limitations.

The termination of any such indemnification obligations, however, shall not
affect any Claim if a notice thereof has been given to the Sellers Agent
prior to such termination, regardless of the fact that the amount of the
potential Specific Loss is not precisely known or determined at that time.
