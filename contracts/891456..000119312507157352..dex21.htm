is then outstanding, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be
converted into an obligation of the Surviving Company to pay to the holder
thereof an amount in cash (reduced by any applicable withholding) equal to
the product of (i) the number of Shares previously subject to such Option,
whether or not then exercisable or vested, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Aggregate Consideration Per Share over the exercise price per
share previously subject to such Option. The conversion of an Option shall be
deemed a release of any and all rights the holder had or may have in respect
of such Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of each holder of an Option to
the Option conversion in this Section 1.7(a).

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding award of
restricted stock granted by the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to any
employee benefit plan (the "Restricted Shares") that has not vested shall
become fully vested and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (reduced by any applicable withholding) for each Restricted
Share previously subject to such award. Each holder of a Restricted Share
shall be permitted to make an election with respect to the
Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 1.6.

Section 1.8 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Share, the
holder of which shall not have voted in favor of or consented in writing
to the Merger and shall have properly complied with the provisions of Section
262 of the Delaware Law as to appraisal rights (a "Dissenting Share"), shall
be deemed converted into and to represent the right to receive
Merger Consideration hereunder; and the holders of Dissenting Shares, if any,
shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by
Section 262 of the Delaware Law; _provided, however_ , that if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the Delaware Law or a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the Delaware Law, then such holder or
holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit such rights as are granted by
Section 262 and each such Dissenting Share shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in Section 1.9, of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Shares.



 

4 (b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Company Common Stock and the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal of the Company Common Stock, offer to settle or settle any such
demands. Any amount payable to any holder of Dissenting Shares exercising
appraisal rights shall be paid in accordance with the Delaware Law solely by
the Surviving Company from its own funds.

Section 1.9 _Election Procedures; Allocation of Merger Consideration_. 

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates theretofore representing shares of the Company
Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the
Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to
the procedures set forth therein) in such form as Parent shall specify and as
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Election Form") and
pursuant to which each holder of record of shares of the Company Common Stock
as of the close of business on the Election Form Record Date may make an
election pursuant to this Section 1.9, shall be mailed at the same time as the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or at such other time as the Company and Parent may
agree (the date on which such mailing is commenced or such other agreed date,
the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of the Company Common Stock as of
the close of business on the record date for notice of the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the "Election Form Record Date"). Such Election Form
shall require each holder of record of a Certificate to specify whether such
holder of record is a citizen of the United States, within the meaning of
Section 2 of the Shipping Act of 1916, as amended (46 U.S.C. Section 802),
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify.

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than
any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such
holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("Stock Election Shares"), (ii) the
number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which
such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration ("Cash Election
Shares"), or (iii) that such holder makes no election with respect to such
holders Company Common Stock ("Non-Election Shares"). Any Company Common
Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective,
properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the
33rd day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the
Company and Parent shall agree) (the "Election Deadline") (other than any
shares of the Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of
such time) shall also be deemed to be Non-Election Shares. Parent and the
Company may agree to extend such deadline to such other date as is agreed to
by Parent and the Company, and the Company and Parent shall make a public
announcement of such new Election Deadline, if any.

(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of the Company Common Stock between the Election Form
Record Date and the close of business on the business day prior to the
Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.



 

5 (d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by (i) one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all certificated shares
of the Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form or (ii) in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents specified by the procedures
set forth in the Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal
materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or
changed by the Person submitting such Election Form prior to the Election
Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election
Deadline, the shares of the Company Common Stock represented by such Election
Form shall become Non-Election Shares and Parent shall cause the
Certificates, if any, representing the Company Common Stock to be promptly
returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon
written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election
Form, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is properly made
with respect to any or all of the applicable shares of the Company Common
Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the
Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any
election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith
decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and
conclusive. None of Parent, Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be under any
obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

(e) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to allocate among the holders of the
Company Common Stock with rights to receive Merger Consideration in accordance
with the Election Form as follows:

(i) _Cash Election Shares for more than Total Cash Amount_. If the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the Cash Election Shares by (y) the Per Share
Cash Consideration is greater than the Total Cash Amount, then:

(A) All Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,

(B) The Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
pro rata to the holders of Cash Election Shares in accordance with their
respective numbers of Cash Election Shares (except as provided in the last
paragraph of this Section 1.9(e)), a sufficient number of shares ("Stock
Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in
the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all
Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration, and



 

6 (C) The Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

(ii) _Cash Election Shares for less than Total Cash Amount_. If the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the Cash Election Shares by (y) the Per Share Cash
Consideration is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:

(A) All Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration,

(B) The Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the Non-Election
Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, in each
case pro rata to the holders of Non-Election Shares or Stock Election Shares,
as the case may be, in accordance with their respective numbers of Non-
Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as the case may be, a sufficient
number of shares ("Cash Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash
amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the
Total Cash Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and

(C) The Stock Election Shares and the Non-Election Shares that are not
Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration.

(iii) _Cash Election Shares equal to Total Cash Amount_. If the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the Cash Election Shares by (y) the Per Share Cash
Consideration is equal to the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (i) and
(ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock
Election Shares and Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, for purposes of determining the allocations set
forth in this Section 1.9, Parent shall have the right to require, but not the
obligation to require (unless such requirement is necessary to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2(f) or Section 6.3(d)), that any shares of
the Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of the Election
Deadline be treated as Cash Election Shares not subject to the pro rata
selection process contemplated by this Section 1.9, and, if Parent so
requires, then, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any Dissenting Shares
that receive the Merger Consideration shall be treated as Cash Election Shares
not subject to the pro rata selection process contemplated by this Section
1.9.

(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually
determined by Parent and the Company.



 

7 Section 1.10 _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the
holders of Shares in connection with the Merger to receive the Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 1.6(a). Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock, (a) certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 and delivered pursuant to
this Section 1.10 and (b) cash or immediately available funds equal to the
Total Cash Amount. Such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto (as provided in Section
1.10(e)) and such funds, are referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund." The
Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, shall deliver the Parent Common Stock and the cash
portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued or paid pursuant to
Section 1.6 out of the Exchange Fund, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose whatsoever. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to
vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Common
Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and
hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed after the
deposit of such Exchange Fund with respect thereto for the account of persons
entitled thereto. Such funds in the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by the Surviving Company, _provided, however,_
that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or of any agency thereof and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or
bankers acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or
Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks with capital,
surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $100 million (based on
the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly
available at the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") or otherwise);
_provided, however_ , that no loss on any investment made pursuant to this
Section 1.9 shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Shares, and following any losses, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company
in the amount of any such losses.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of (i) an outstanding certificate or certificates ("Certificates")
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such holders Shares
or (ii) Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth therein, which shall
be in customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the
Effective Time) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
shares, in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to such
letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
pursuant to such instructions, (A) the  



 

8  holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock, if any, and cash portion of the Merger Consideration
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section
1.10(f), and any unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 1.10(e) (after giving effect to any
required withholding of taxes); and (B) such Certificate or book-entry shall
then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.
If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the
stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such
taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. The Surviving Company shall
pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in
connection with the distribution of the Merger Consideration.

(c) At any time following one year after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any
funds and shares of Parent Common Stock in the Exchange Fund which had been
made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of Shares
(including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the
Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it) and, thereafter,
such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Company (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration (along with cash in lieu of
fractional shares or unpaid dividends and distributions, if any that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Company nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such Share to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and, thereafter, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
law.

(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
declared or made after the Effective Time with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate.
Subject to the effect of applicable law: (i) at the time of the surrender of
a Certificate for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section
1.10, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the
amount of dividends or other distributions (having a record date after the
Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date on or prior to
surrender) not theretofore paid with respect to the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive (less the  



 

9  amount of any withholding taxes that may be required with respect thereto);
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date and without duplicating any
payment made under clause (i) above, there shall be paid to the surrendering
holder, without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions
(having a record date after the Effective Time but on or prior to surrender
and a payment date subsequent to surrender) payable with respect to the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder receives (less
the amount of any withholding taxes that may be required with respect
thereto).

(f) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued in the Merger and, except as provided in this Section
1.10(f), no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest shall
relate to any such fractional share, and such fractional share shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
Parent. In lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which a
holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled (after taking into
account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by or on behalf of
such holder), such holder, upon surrender of a Certificate as described in
this Section 1.10, shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest)
determined by multiplying (i) the Final Parent Stock Price by (ii) the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would in
addition otherwise be entitled, in which case Parent shall make available to
the Exchange Agent, to any other cash being provided to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 1.10(a), the amount of cash necessary to make such
payments. The Parties acknowledge that payment of cash consideration in lieu
of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately
bargained for consideration but represents merely a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of simplifying the problems that would otherwise be caused by
the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

Section 1.11  _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any former holder of Shares (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Restricted Shares) pursuant to this Agreement any amount
as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so
properly withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, and are paid over to the appropriate governmental
authority in accordance with applicable law, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be. 

ARTICLE II

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that,
except as otherwise set forth (i) in the Companys Schedules to this Agreement
(the "Company Schedule") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section of the Schedule shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect to
any other section of this Article II to which the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent on its face) or (ii) in the Company SEC Documents
(excluding any forward-looking statements included therein or any statements
of a cautionary nature that are not historical facts in any risk factor
section of such documents) filed prior to the date of this Agreement:



 

10 __Section 2.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries._ The Company is
a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character of the properties owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each subsidiary of the
Company (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) has the requisite corporate or other
business entity power and authority to own or lease its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted and (iii) is duly licensed
or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character of the properties owned or leased by
it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, in each case, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. When used in connection with the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on
the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or on the ability of the Company
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each
case, for any such effect attributable to (i) general economic, capital
market, regulatory or political conditions, any outbreak of hostilities or war
(including acts of terrorism), natural disasters or other _force majeure_
events, in each case in the United States or elsewhere, _provided, however,_
that any such condition or event which disproportionately impacts the Company
or its subsidiaries taken as a whole, relative to other industry participants,
may be considered to the extent of such disproportionate impact (ii) changes
in or events or conditions generally affecting the oil and gas exploration and
development industry or exploration and production companies of a similar size
to the Company (including changes in commodity prices and general
market prices), (iii) changes in laws, regulations or United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") or interpretations thereof, (iv) the
announcement or pendency of this Agreement, any actions taken in compliance
with this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (v) any failure by the
Company to meet estimates of revenues or earnings for any period ending after
the date of this Agreement, provided that this clause (v) does not prevent a
determination that any underlying causes of such failure resulted in or
contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect, (vi) fluctuations in
currency exchange rates, (vii) the downgrade in rating of any debt securities
of the Company by Standard and Poors Rating Group, Moodys Investor Services,
Inc. or Fitch Ratings, provided that this clause (vii) does not prevent a
determination that any underlying causes of such downgrade resulted in
or contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect or (viii) changes in the
price or trading volume of the Companys stock, provided that this clause
(viii) does not prevent a determination that any underlying causes of such
changes resulted in or contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect. A
true and complete list of all of the Companys subsidiaries, together with the
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each such subsidiary and the
percentage of the outstanding capital stock of each such subsidiary owned by
the Company and each other Company subsidiary, is set forth in Section 2.1 of
the Company Schedule. Other than with respect to the Company subsidiaries set
forth on Section  

 

11  2.1 of the Company Schedule, the Company does not directly or indirectly own
any equity interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for, any equity interest in, any corporation, partnership,
joint venture or other business entity, other than equity interests held for
investment which are not, in the aggregate, material to the Company. The term
"Company Material Subsidiaries" means each Company subsidiary designated as
such on Section 2.1 of the Company Schedule. The Company Material Subsidiaries
are the only Company subsidiaries that constitute "significant
subsidiaries" within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X.

Section 2.2 _Charter and Bylaws._ The Company has heretofore furnished
to Parent a true and complete copy of its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, each as amended to date. Such certificate of incorporation and bylaws
are in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement.

Section 2.3 _Capitalization._ The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 200,000,000 Shares and 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $1.00 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of June 30, 2007,
(i) 58,650,282 Shares were issued and outstanding (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Shares in the form of restricted stock issued pursuant to
employee benefit plans of the Company), all of which were validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable (except for any restricted stock), and none of
which were issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights of
any securityholder of the Company and (ii) Options to purchase an aggregate
of 1,385,134 Shares were issued and outstanding (of which Options to purchase
an aggregate of 1,385,134 Shares were exercisable). As of the date hereof,
2,000,000 shares of the Company Preferred Stock are reserved for issuance in
connection with the Companys Rights Agreement dated as of April 26, 1994, as
amended on April 26, 2004 (the "Company Rights Plan," with the rights provided
for therein being the "Rights"), and no shares of the Company Preferred Stock
are issued and outstanding. Since June 30, 2007 to the date of this Agreement,
the Company has not issued any shares of capital stock or granted any options
covering shares of capital stock, except for Shares and associated Rights
issued pursuant to the exercise of Options or pursuant to any employee
ownership or benefit plan. Subject to the foregoing, there are no options,
warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character obligating the Company or any Company Material Subsidiary to issue
or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the
Company or any Company Material Subsidiary. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any Company Material Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any Company Material Subsidiary. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock or equivalent equity interests of each Company Material
Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and
non-assessable and (except for directors qualifying shares or shares
representing an immaterial equity interest that are required under the laws
of any foreign jurisdiction to be owned by others) are owned by the Company,
directly or through its subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest,
mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance or claim (other than in favor of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries); and none of the outstanding shares of
capital stock or equivalent equity interests of the Company Material
Subsidiaries were issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights
arising by operation of law, or under the charter, bylaws or other comparable
organizational documents of any Company Material Subsidiary or under any
agreement to which the Company or any Company Material Subsidiary is a
party. 



 

12 Section 2.4 _Authority; Due Authorization; Binding Agreement; Approval_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement
subject, with respect to the Merger, to the adoption of this Agreement by the

of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the Company stockholders, to the
extent required by applicable law, and the filing of appropriate merger
documents as required by Delaware Law).

(c) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and
Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as

reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting the rights or remedies of creditors and by general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(d) (i) The board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board of
Directors"), at a meeting duly called and held, has (A) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company stockholders, (B) approved this Agreement and (C)
resolved (subject to Section 5.3) to recommend the adoption of this Agreement
by the stockholders of the Company; and (ii) Goldman, Sachs and Company and
Toronto Dominion Bank (the "Company Financial Advisors") have delivered to the
Company Board of Directors written opinions to the effect that, as of the
date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the
Merger Consideration to be received by the Company stockholders pursuant to
the Merger is fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view. The
Company will provide Parent (solely for informational purposes) a true,
correct and complete copy of such opinion promptly following receipt thereof.

Section 2.5 _No Violation; Consents._

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not (i) violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company,
(ii) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default) under
any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other
agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them or any of their respective properties are
bound, (iii) (assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in Section
2.5(b) are duly and timely made or obtained and that, to the extent required
by applicable law, the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of
the Company stockholders is obtained) violate any statute, law or regulation
or any order, judgment, decree or injunction of any court or governmental
authority directed to the Company or any of its  



 

13  subsidiaries or any of their properties or (iv) result in the creation or
imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property of the
Company or its subsidiaries pursuant to the agreements and instruments
referred to in clause (ii), except, in the case of clause (ii), (iii) or (iv),
for such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults or liens, that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except for (i) compliance with applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder (the "HSR Act") and any other applicable law analogous
to the HSR Act or otherwise regulating antitrust, competition or merger
control matters in foreign jurisdictions, (ii) compliance with any applicable
requirements of (A) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities

Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
the Company that, except as otherwise set forth (i) in the Parent Parties
Schedules to this  



 

28  Agreement (the "Parent Schedule") (it being agreed that disclosure of any
item in any section of the Parent Schedule shall also be deemed to be
disclosed with respect to any other section of this Article III to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face) or (ii) in the
Parent SEC Documents (excluding any forward-looking statements included
therein or any statements of a cautionary nature that are not historical
facts in any risk factor section of such documents) filed prior to the date of
this Agreement:

Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Parent is a
corporation duly incorporated and validly existing in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, and Merger Sub is a limited liability company
duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease its properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character of the properties owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect on Parent (as defined below). Each subsidiary
of Parent (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) has the requisite corporate or other
business entity power and authority to own or lease its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted and (iii) is duly licensed
or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character of the properties owned or leased by
it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, in each case, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. When used in connection with Parent or any of its subsidiaries, the
term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on the
business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of Parent
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or on the ability of Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in
each case, for any such effect attributable to (i) general economic, capital
market, regulatory or political conditions, any outbreak of hostilities or war
(including acts of terrorism), natural disasters or other _force majeure_
events, in each case in the United States or elsewhere, _provided, however,_
that any such condition or event which disproportionately impacts Parent or
its subsidiaries taken as a whole, relative to other industry participants,
may be considered to the extent of such disproportionate impact, (ii) changes
in or events or conditions generally affecting the oil and gas exploration and
development industry or exploration and production companies of a similar size
to Parent (including changes in commodity prices and general market prices),
(iii) changes in laws, regulations or GAAP or interpretations thereof, (iv)
the announcement or pendency of this Agreement, any actions taken in
compliance with this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (v) any
failure by Parent to meet estimates of revenues or earnings for any period
ending after the date of this Agreement, _provided_ that this clause (v) does
not prevent a determination that any underlying causes of such failure
resulted in or contributed to a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (vi)
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, (vii) the downgrade in rating of any
debt securities of Parent by Standard and Poors Rating Group, Moodys Investor
Services, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, _provided_ that this clause (vii) does not
prevent a determination that any underlying causes of such downgrade resulted
in or contributed to a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (viii) changes in
the price or trading volume of Parents stock, _provided_ that this clause
(viii) does not prevent a determination that any underlying causes of such
changes resulted in or contributed to a Parent Material Adverse Effect. A
true and complete list of all Parents  



 

29  subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization of each such subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding
capital stock of each such subsidiary owned by Parent and each other Parent
subsidiary, is set forth in Section 3.1 of the Parent Schedule. Other than

Schedule, Parent does not directly or indirectly own any equity interest in,
or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
equity interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business entity, other than equity interests held for investment which are
not, in the aggregate, material to Parent. With respect to Parent, the term
"Parent Material Subsidiaries" means each Parent subsidiary designated as such
on Section 3.1 of the Parent Schedule. The Parent Material Subsidiaries are
the only Parent subsidiaries that constitute "significant subsidiaries" within
the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X.

Merger Sub has heretofore furnished to the Company true and complete copies of
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certificate of formation and

granted any options covering shares of capital stock, except for shares of
Parent Common Stock and associated Parent Rights issued pursuant to the
exercise of options or pursuant to any employee ownership or benefit plan.

agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character obligating Parent or
any Parent Material Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock
of, or other equity interests in, Parent or any Parent Material Subsidiary.
There are no outstanding contractual obligations of Parent or any Parent
Material Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of

shares representing an immaterial equity interest that are required under the

Amended and Restated Credit Agreement); and none of the outstanding shares
of capital stock or equivalent equity interests of the Parent Material
Subsidiaries were issued in violation of any preemptive or

be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the management of Parent as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. The management of Parent has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting in

controls were effective. To the knowledge of Parent, it has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluations, to Parents outside auditors and the audit
committee of the board of directors of Parent (A) all significant deficiencies
in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and
any material weaknesses, which have more than a remote chance to
materially adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal controls over
financial reporting.

(b) Since January 1, 2006, to the knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its subsidiaries nor any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of Parent or any of its subsidiaries has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its subsidiaries has a
"significant deficiency" or "material weakness" (as such terms are defined in

on the date hereof), in Parents internal controls over financial reporting.

of any of its capital stock, other than regular quarterly dividends not in
excess of the amount paid for the most recent quarter.

Tax matters or Environmental Laws, which are addressed exclusively in
Sections 3.13, 3.16 and 3.17, respectively, there is no action, suit or

maintained, in all material respects, in accordance with their terms and with
all provisions of ERISA (including rules and regulations thereunder) and other
applicable federal and state law, and neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries nor any "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with

Plans") that are subject to the law of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States (i) have been established and maintained in accordance with all
applicable requirements, (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax

(a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate and promptly prepare the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall file the
Registration Statement in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
included as a prospectus with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof and in any event not later than 45 days after the date hereof.
Parent and the Company shall cooperate to promptly respond to any comments
made by the SEC and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after filing. Parent and the Company will provide
each other with any information which may be required to prepare and file the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement hereunder. Each of
Parent and the Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed
to its respective stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any event occurs which is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement, Parent or the Company, as applicable, will promptly
inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing such amendment or
supplement with the SEC, use reasonable best efforts to cause such amendment
to become effective as promptly as possible and, if required, mail same to
stockholders of Parent and/or the Company. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent, to obtain any and all
necessary state securities laws or "blue sky" permits, approvals and
registrations in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger.

(b) Parent will cause the Registration Statement (and Parent and the Company
will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, each to the extent such
Party provides information to be contained therein), at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, to comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and the Company
shall be responsible for furnishing to Parent materially true, accurate and
complete information relating to the Company and holders of the Company Common
Stock and Options as is required to be included therein. Parent shall advise
the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, the
issuance of any stop order with respect to the Registration Statement, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
comments or requests for additional information by the SEC with respect to
the Registration Statement.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that the information provided
by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or
supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the
respective meetings of stockholders of Parent and the Company, or, in the case
of information provided by it for inclusion in the Registration Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it becomes effective, will
not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.



 

46 (d) Neither the Registration Statement nor the Proxy Statement/Prospectus nor
any amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) thereto
will be filed or disseminated to the stockholders of the Company or Parent
without the approval of both Parent and the Company, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided that, with respect
to documents filed by a party hereto that are incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval
shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or
its business, financial condition or results of operations; and provided,
further, that the Company, in connection with a Change in the Company
Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or Registration Statement (including by incorporation by reference) to effect
such a Change in the Company Recommendation, and in such event, this right of
approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other
party or its business, financial condition or results of operations.

(e) The Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, shall,
in accordance with applicable law and the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an
annual or special meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting") as
soon as reasonably practicable following execution of this Agreement for the
purpose of adopting by requisite vote this Agreement (the "Company Stockholder
Approval"). The Company Board of Directors shall, subject to Section
5.3(b), recommend the adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting
(the "Company Recommendation"), include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1
and subject to compliance with Section 5.3, the Company, regardless of whether
the Board of Directors (whether or not acting through the Special Committee,
if then in existence) has approved, endorsed or recommended an Alternative
Proposal or has withdrawn, modified or amended the Recommendation, will submit
this Agreement for approval by the stockholders of the Company at such
meeting.

(f) Parent, acting through the Parent Board of Directors, shall, in accordance
with applicable law and Parents certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of
its stockholders (the "Parent Stockholders Meeting") as soon as reasonably
practicable following execution of this Agreement for the purpose of adopting
by requisite vote this Agreement (the "Parent Stockholder Approval"). The
Parent Board of Directors shall recommend the approval of the issuance of the
Parent Common Stock in connection with this Agreement, include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1, Parent will submit this Agreement for approval by the
stockholders of Parent at such meeting.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent or the Company, after consultation with the other party hereto and
subject to such other partys  



 

47  approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting or the
Company Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, to the extent it believes in
good faith is necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to its stockholders or, if as of
the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting or the Company
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock or
the Company Common Stock, as applicable, represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting.

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to
authorize for listing on the New York Stock Exchange the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable and required to be reserved for issuance in connection
with the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance.

Section 5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) To the extent not restricted by third-party agreement or applicable law,
each of Parent and the Company shall, subject to any necessary third-
party approvals, allow the other party and its officers, employees,
representatives, consultants, attorneys, agents, lenders, bankers, financial
advisors and other advisors reasonable access during normal business hours, at
such partys sole risk and expenses, to all facilities, properties,
personnel, books and records of Parent or the Company and their respective
subsidiaries, as applicable. Each of Parent and the Company agree to conduct
its investigation in a manner that does not interfere unreasonably with the
other partys or its subsidiaries operations and with the prompt and timely
discharge by such partys employees of their duties. The Parent Parties agree
to indemnify and hold the Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from any and
all claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses for loss, injury to
or death of any representative of the Parent Parties, and any loss, damage to
or destruction of any property owned by the Company or the Subsidiaries or
others (including claims or liabilities for loss of use of any property)
resulting directly or indirectly from the action or inaction of any of the
Parent Parties representatives during any visit to the business or property
sites of the Company or the Subsidiaries prior to the completion of the
Merger, whether pursuant to this Section 5.2 or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing no party shall be required to provide access to or otherwise
disclose information if such information is subject to, or such access or
disclosure would jeopardize, the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege concerning legal proceedings or
governmental investigations. None of the Parent Parties nor any of their
officers, employees, representatives, consultants, attorneys, agents, lenders,
bankers, financial advisors or other advisors shall conduct any environmental
testing or sampling on any of the business or property sites of the Company
or the Subsidiaries prior to the completion of the Merger without the prior
written consent of the Company.

(b) Any information obtained by the Parent Parties or the Company or their
respective directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants,
attorneys, agents, lenders, bankers, financial advisors and other advisors
under this Section 5.2 shall be subject to the confidentiality and use
restrictions contained in that certain letter agreement between the Company
and Parent dated June 27, 2007 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").



 

48 Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of
the officers and directors of it or its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
not cause its and such subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its subsidiaries), not to directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit
or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer
with respect to, or a transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar
transaction involving the Company or any Company subsidiary, or any purchase
or sale of 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including stock of its
subsidiaries) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any
purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its equity securities
that, if consummated, would result in any person (or the stockholders of such
person) beneficially owning securities representing 20% or more of the
Companys total voting power (or of the surviving parent entity in such
transaction) (any such inquiry, proposal, offer or transaction, an
"Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) have any discussion with or provide or cause to
be provided any non-public information to any person relating to
an Acquisition Proposal, or engage or participate in any negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or
(iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse
or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, option
agreement, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement or agree to do any of the foregoing related to any
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
any violation of this Section 5.3 by any subsidiary of the Company or
representatives of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or its Board of
Directors may (i) engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with,
or provide or cause to be provided any information to, any person in response
to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material
breach of clause (a) above if (A) the Companys Board of Directors concludes
in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial
advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and (B) prior to providing
any non-public information to any person in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal by any such person, the Company receives from such person an
executed confidentiality agreement having provisions that are no less
restrictive than those of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood
that the Company may enter into a confidentiality agreement without a
standstill provision or with a standstill provision less favorable to the
Company if it waives or similarly modifies the standstill provision in the
Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_ that the Company shall promptly provide
or make available to Parent any material non-public information concerning
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to the person making
such Alternative Proposal or such persons representatives which was not
previously provided or made available to Parent or its representatives, (ii)
fail to make, withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw,
modify or qualify) the Company Recommendation or approve or recommend (or
publicly propose to approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal or letter
of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement
providing for any Acquisition Proposal (a  



 

49  "Change in the Company Recommendation") if (A) the Company Board of
Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisors, that a Change in the Company Recommendation is
necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations or (B) the Company
has received an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal and its Board of
Directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal, and its Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, that a Change in
the Company Recommendation is necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary
obligations; _provided, however,_ that no Change in the Company Recommendation
may be made until (x) the fifth business day following Parents receipt of
written notice (a "Notice of Intended Change in the Company Recommendation")
from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends
to make a Change in the Company Recommendation and specifying the material
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, if any, that is related to
such Change in the Company Recommendation and the identity of the party making
such proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of any such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Intended Change in the Company Recommendation
and a new five business day period) or, if the intended Change in the Company
Recommendation does not relate to a Superior Proposal, a general description
of the material events giving rise thereto and (y) if there is a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board of Directors has approved or concurrently approves
a definitive agreement in respect of such proposal and terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and otherwise complies with Section
7.3 and other provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, disclosure by the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be
deemed to be a Change in the Company Recommendation. "Superior Proposal" means
an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board of Directors determines, in
good faith and after consultation with its outside counsel and financial
advisors, is reasonably capable of being completed, is, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board of Directors, reasonably capable of being fully
financed and is more favorable to the holders of the Shares (in their
capacity as stockholders) than the transactions provided for in this
Agreement, taking into account, among other things, the likelihood and timing
of consummation, any proposal or offer by Parent or the person making such
Acquisition Proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Merger
during the applicable time periods specified above and such other factors
deemed relevant by the Company Board of Directors; _provided_  that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "20%" shall be deemed to be "50%".

(c) the Company agrees that it will advise Parent of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal within 24 hours and keep Parent reasonably and
promptly informed of the status and material terms of and any material
changes to any Acquisition Proposals and the status of any related discussions
or negotiations, including the identity of the person making such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company agrees that it will, and will cause its officers,
directors and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any person (other than Parent) conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
its Board of Directors from disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ that this clause (d) shall not allow a Change in the Company
Recommendation other than in accordance with clause (b) above.



 

50 (e) Any action pursuant to Section 5.3(b), (c) or (d) shall not constitute a
breach of the Companys representations, warranties or covenants in this
Agreement.

Section 5.4 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company and the
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions
no less favorable to the persons covered thereby with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses than are set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time
from and after the date of this Agreement and to and including the Effective
Time were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the matters
contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by law.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify, hold harmless and
advance expenses to each present and former director, officer, employee,
fiduciary and agent of the Company and each Subsidiary (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against all costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, inquiries, liabilities and
settlement amounts paid in connection with any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as
an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent (including, without
limitation, any claim arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby), whether occurring before or after the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law (and shall pay any expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, upon receipt from
the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced of any undertaking to
repay such advances required under applicable law). In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel (including local counsel) satisfactory to them, the
reasonable fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the Surviving Company,
promptly after statements therefor are received and (ii) the Surviving Company
shall use reasonable best efforts in the vigorous defense of any such matter;
_provided, however_ , that the Surviving Company shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); and _provided further_ that
the Surviving Company shall not be obligated pursuant to this subsection (b)
to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (plus appropriate local
counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in any single action unless there is, as
determined by counsel to the Indemnified Parties, under applicable standards
of professional conduct, a conflict or a reasonable likelihood of a conflict
on any significant issue between the  



 

51  positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case such
additional counsel (including local counsel) as may be required to avoid any
such conflict or likely conflict may be retained by the Indemnified Parties
at the expense of the Surviving Company; and _provided further_ that, in the
event that any claim for indemnification is asserted or made prior to the
Effective Time or within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
in respect of such claim shall continue until the final disposition of such
claim. The Surviving Company shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.4.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, for six
years from the Effective Time, maintain in effect the current directors and
officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company ( _provided_
that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to such officers and directors so long as substitution does not
result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the
Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.4(c) more
than an amount per year equal to 100% of current annual premiums paid by the
Company for such insurance and, in the event the cost of such coverage shall
exceed that amount, the Surviving Company shall purchase as much coverage as
possible for such amount.

(d) In the event the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.4.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Company should fail, at any time from and
after the Effective Time, to comply with any of the foregoing obligations set
forth in this Section 5.4, for any reason, Parent shall be responsible
therefor and hereby agrees to perform such obligations unconditionally
without regard to any defense or other basis for nonperformance which the
Surviving Company may have or claim (except as would be prohibited by
applicable Delaware Law), it being the intention of this subsection (e) that
the officers, directors, employees, fiduciaries and agents of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall be fully indemnified and that the provisions of this
subsection (e) be a primary obligation of Parent and not merely a guarantee by
Parent of the obligations of the Surviving Company.

(f) The obligations of the Company, Parent and/or the Surviving Company under
this Section 5.4 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent to whom
this Section 5.4 applies without the consent of each affected director,
officer, employee, fiduciary and agent (it being expressly agreed that the
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents to whom this Section
5.4 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.4). The
rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any other
rights such Indemnified Party may have under the charter or bylaws of the
Company, under the Delaware Law or otherwise.



 

52 Section 5.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence, or
nonoccurrence, of which would be likely to cause any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate
and (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be,
to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement required to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
_provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
5.5 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice; and _provided further_ that this Section 5.5
shall not constitute an obligation, covenant or agreement for purposes of
Article VIII.

Section 5.6  _Governmental Filings; Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable with any governmental authority or other third party
all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,

registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be
obtained from any governmental authority or other third party that are

Company shall (A) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated

request and (C) take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act as soon as

(b) Each of the Company and Parent (and, as applicable, Merger Sub) shall
promptly notify the other of any communication concerning this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby to that party or its affiliates from
any governmental authority and permit the other to review in advance any
proposed communication concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to any governmental authority.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent (and, as applicable, Merger Sub) shall not
participate or agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any
governmental authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
unless it consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such governmental authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting or discussion.



 

53 (d) Each of the Company and Parent (and, as applicable, Merger Sub) shall
furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and its affiliates and representatives on the one hand, and any government or
regulatory authority or members of any such authoritys staff on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Subject to Section 5.5, and in furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative
or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party,
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or (ii) so long as such party has,
prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this Section
5.6.

(f) The Company shall cooperate with Parent with respect to, and use
commercially reasonable best efforts to facilitate, possible alternative or
supplemental structures (including internal restructurings by the Company or
its Subsidiaries) for the acquisition of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
_provided_ that such structures do not impede or delay the Closing of the
transaction or change the Merger Consideration or adversely affect the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, should the Merger not occur.

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements (including press conferences or conference calls with investors or
analysts) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange to which
Parent or the Company is a party, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the
other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content
of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at
the final discretion of the disclosing party.

Section 5.8 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent agrees to take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub to perform all of Merger Subs, and the Surviving Company to
perform all of the Surviving Companys, agreements, covenants and obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent shall be liable for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Merger Sub
in this Agreement and for any breach of this covenant.



 

54 Section 5.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent and the Company agree that all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be employed by
the Surviving Company immediately after the Effective Time, it being
understood that Parent and the Surviving Company shall, except as required by
law, have no obligations to continue employing such employees for any length
of time thereafter except pursuant to any agreements which are specifically
disclosed on Section 2.12 of the Company Schedule and identified therein as
providing such an exception. Parent shall deem, and shall cause the Surviving
Company to deem, the period of employment with the Company and the
Subsidiaries (and with predecessor employers with respect to which the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall have granted service credit) to have been
employment and service with Parent and the Surviving Company for benefit plan
eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for purposes of benefit accruals or
benefit computations) for all of Parents and the Surviving Companys employee
benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements to the extent service with
Parent or the Surviving Company is recognized under any such plan, program,
policy or arrangement.

(b) Under any medical and dental plans covering any employee or former
employee of the Company, there shall be waived, and Parent or the Surviving
Company shall cause the relevant insurance carriers and other third parties to
waive, all restrictions and limitations for any medical condition existing as
of the Effective Time of any of such employees and their eligible dependents
for the purpose of any such plans, provided such persons had the requisite
"creditable" service prior to the Effective Time, but only to the extent that
such condition would be covered by the relevant Company Employee Benefit Plan
if it were not a pre-existing condition and only to the extent of comparable
coverage in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Further, Parent
shall offer to each Company and Subsidiary employee coverage under a group
health plan which credits such employee towards the deductibles imposed under
the group medical and dental plan of Parent or the Surviving Company, for the
year during which the Effective Time occurs, with any deductibles already
incurred during such year under the relevant Company Employee Benefit Plan.

Section 5.10 _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate
the financing (the "Debt Financing") necessary to provide immediately
available funds (the "Funds") sufficient (1) to pay the Merger Consideration
for all outstanding Shares pursuant to the Merger and (2) for any other
amounts payable by Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto and (ii) consummate the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time.
Parent will furnish correct and complete copies of all such definitive
agreements to the Company promptly upon their execution.

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed with respect to all material
activity concerning the status of the Debt Financing and shall give the
Company prompt notice of any material adverse change with respect to such
debt financing. Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event
within two business days, if at any time for any reason Parent no longer
believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of
the  



 

55  Funds. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its affiliates to,
without the prior written consent of the Company, take or fail to take any
action or enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition,
joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt financing that could
reasonably expected to delay or prevent consummation of the Debt Financing.

Section 5.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take
steps reasonably necessary to cause dispositions of Shares (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer who is subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
thereunder in accordance procedures in such rule or under that certain No-
Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

Section 5.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. Subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
full in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.13 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the Merger, the Voting Agreements or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent
and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that
the Merger, the Voting Agreements and the other transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
herein and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute
or regulation on the Merger, the Voting Agreements and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 5.14 _Agreements of Affiliates; Lock-up Agreements_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to Parent a list identifying all persons who, at
the time of the Company Meeting, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the
Company as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act ("Rule 145"), and such list shall be updated as necessary to
reflect changes from the date thereof. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each person who is identified as an affiliate of
the Company under Rule 145 in such list to execute and deliver to Parent, on
or prior to the Closing Date, a written agreement, in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit 5.14(a). Parent shall give stop transfer instructions to its
transfer agent with respect to any Company Common Stock received pursuant to
the Merger by any stockholder of the Company who may reasonably be deemed to
be an affiliate of the Company for purposes of Rule 145, and Parent shall
cause the transfer agent to place legends on the Parent
Certificates representing any Parent Common Stock to be issued to such
persons in the Merger, irrespective of whether or not such persons sign such
agreements, which legends in substance shall provide that the shares were
issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 applies and may only be transferred
(i) in conformity with Rule 145, or (ii) in accordance with a written opinion
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent that such transfer is exempt from
registration under the Securities Act. 



 

56 (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each executive
officer or director of the Company who will be employed by or serve as a
director of Parent after the Merger to execute and deliver to Parent prior to
the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus a lock-up agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit 5.14(b) to the effect that such executive officer
shall not sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any Parent Common
Stock or rights to acquire such shares of Parent Common Stock, except as
permitted by such lock-up agreement.

Section 5.15 _Repayment of Certain Obligations_. Upon consummation of the

prepay all amounts under its credit agreement with Bank of Montreal, as
administrative agent, and the other lenders and (ii) redeem all of its
outstanding 8.25% notes.

Section 5.16 _Reorganization_.

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set
forth in Section 6.2(f) and Section 6.3(d). Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with the treatment of the
Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and in particular as a transaction described in Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the
Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(b)(1)(ii). This Agreement is
intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Sec. 1.368-2(g).

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver to Andrews Kurth LLP and Baker Botts
L.L.P. a "Tax Representation Letter," dated as of the Closing Date and signed
by an officer of Parent, containing representations of Parent and Merger Sub,
and the Company shall deliver to Andrews Kurth LLP and Baker Botts L.L.P. a
"Tax Representation Letter," dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an
officer of the Company, containing representations of the Company, in each
case as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Andrews Kurth
LLP and Baker Botts L.L.P. to render the opinions described in Section 6.2(f)
and Section 6.3(d). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would
cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which
would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations
included in the tax representation letters described in this Section 5.16.

Section 5.17 _Comfort Letters_.

(a) In connection with the information regarding the Company and its
subsidiaries or the Merger provided by the Company specifically for inclusion
in, or incorporation by reference into, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement, the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to
cause to be delivered to Buyer a letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, dated
the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and
addressed to Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent
public accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement on Form S-4.



 

57 (b) In connection with the information regarding Parent and its Subsidiaries
or the Merger provided by Parent specifically for inclusion in, or

addressed to the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
similar to the Registration Statement on Form S-4.

Section 5.18 _Consent to Use of Financial Statements; Financing Cooperation_.
The Company hereby consents to Parents inclusion of any audited or unaudited
financial statements, including those contained in any Company SEC Documents,
relating to and prepared by the Company reasonably requested by Parent to be
used in any financing or any filings that Parent desires to make with the SEC.
In addition, the Company will use reasonable best efforts, at Parents
sole cost and expense, to obtain customary comfort letters from
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP regarding financial statements of the Company as
reasonably requested by the lead underwriter(s) or initial purchaser(s) in
connection with any registered or private offering or otherwise and to obtain
the consent of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to the inclusion of the financial
statements referenced above in appropriate filings with the SEC. Prior to the
Closing, the Company will provide Parent such information regarding the
Companys business, and make available such personnel, as Parent may
reasonably request in order to assist Parent in connection with financing
activities, including any public offerings to be registered under
the Securities Act or private offerings.

Section 5.19 _Parent Directors_. Parent shall take all requisite action to,
effective as of the Effective Time, (i) cause two directors currently serving
on the Company Board of Directors to be appointed to the Parent Board of
Directors through the procedures of the nominating committee consistent with
past practice and (ii) expand, to the extent necessary in connection with
appointing such two directors, the Parent Board of Directors.

mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise.

Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by

commence any litigation relating thereto except in such  

 

67  court), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation
in the Delaware Court of Chancery and agrees not to plead or claim that

Section 8.10 _Headings._ The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 8.11 _Interpretation._

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof" or "hereunder," and
similar terms are to be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any specific section. The inclusion of any information in either the
Companys or Parents Schedules to this Agreement (as the case may be the
Company Schedule or the Parent Schedule) shall not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgment, solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information
therein, that such information is required to be included therein or material
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, as the case may be. The disclosure of information in the Company
Schedule or the Parent Schedule as an exception to, or for purposes of, a
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement shall be deemed
adequately disclosed as an exception to, or for purposes of, all other
representations, warranties and covenants herein. The specification of any
dollar amount in the representations and warranties or otherwise in this
Agreement or in the Company Schedule or Parent Schedule is not intended and
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality
of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or
controversy between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or
matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

Section 8.12 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
