1 ARTICLE 2

 

SALE AND PURCHASE OF PURCHASED EQUITY

 

At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to (a) the satisfaction or due
waiver of the conditions in _Article 7_ and (b) the other provisions set
forth in this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell, transfer, assign, convey and
deliver to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase, acquire and accept from
Seller, all of the Purchased Equity.

 

ARTICLE 3

PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT

Section 3.1 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the sale and conveyance
of the Purchased Equity to Buyer is $750,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ "),
subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The "
_Adjusted Purchase Price_ " shall be the Purchase Price, as:

 

(a) (i) decreased by the amount of cash or cash equivalents of the Acquired
Companies distributed from and after the Effective Time until the Closing to
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any of the Acquired Companies) and
(ii) increased by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents contributed to
the Acquired Companies from and after the Effective Time until the Closing
by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the any of Acquired
Companies);

(b) (i) increased by the amount of the Effective Time Net Working Capital, if
positive or (ii) decreased by the amount of the Effective Time Net Working
Capital, if negative (it being understood that if the Effective Time Net
Working Capital is negative, such amount shall be the absolute
value thereof);

(c) (i) increased by any amounts paid (in compliance with the provisions of
_Sections 6.1(b)_ and _6.1(c)_ ) by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than any of the Acquired Companies) on behalf of the Acquired Companies (other
than payments to Seller or any of its Affiliates) from and after the Effective
Time and prior to Closing and (ii) decreased by any amounts or other assets
paid or distributed by any of the Acquired Companies on behalf of the Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than any of the Acquired Companies) from and
after the Effective Time and prior to and including the Closing Date; and

(d) increased by an amount equal to $1,000,000, which the Parties agree
reflects a portion of the reasonable estimate of the alternative minimum Tax
costs and Texas franchise Tax costs that may be incurred by Seller in
connection with the Section 336(e) Election.

 

In calculating the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section 3.1_, no
adjustment may be accounted for in more than one of the paragraphs (a)
through (d) above or in any manner which would result in the duplication of an
item of adjustment.

Section 3.2  _Payment_. Contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement (or as soon as practicable on the first Business Day immediately
thereafter), Buyer has deposited (or will, as applicable, deposit) with Seller
an amount equal to $75,000,000 (such amount, including any interest earned
thereon, the " _Deposit_ ").

Section 3.3 _Adjusted Purchase Price and Post-Closing Purchase Price
Adjustments_.

(a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a settlement statement (the " _Preliminary
Settlement Statement_ ") that contains a reasonably detailed and good faith
estimate of the Adjusted Purchase Price giving effect to Sellers good faith
estimate of the adjustments provided for in _Section 3.1_ (or, if then
determinable, the final amounts

 



2  thereof). If Buyer disputes any amounts or adjustments set forth in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any such dispute by the Closing Date. If the Parties cannot
resolve the dispute, then the amount of the estimated Adjusted Purchase Price
set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by Seller in
accordance with this _Section 3.3(a)_, _less_ the Deposit and such other
adjustments to which the Parties have agreed, shall constitute the dollar
amount to be paid by Buyer to Seller at the Closing (the " _Closing Payment_
").

 

(b) Not later than the ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Post-Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase
Price taking into account any adjustments pursuant to _Section 3.1_. Seller
shall thereafter provide to Buyer such additional data and information as
Buyer may reasonably request to verify the amounts reflected on the
Preliminary Settlement Statement and/or the Post-Closing Statement (and
reasonable access to Sellers personnel, including internal accountants, which
access shall not unreasonably disrupt Sellers day-to-day operations) to
permit Buyer to perform or cause to be performed an audit. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but not later than the sixtieth (60th) day following
receipt of Sellers statement hereunder, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
written report (an " _Adjustment Notice_ ") containing any changes Buyer
proposes to be made in such statement. Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted
and agreed to all items in the Post-Closing Statement, other than such
matters that are proposed to be changed in any Adjustment Notice (it being
understood that if Buyer does not deliver an Adjustment Notice within such
sixty (60) day period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed
to all items in the Post-Closing Statement). The Parties shall undertake to
agree on the final Adjusted Purchase Price no later than thirty (30) Business
Days after delivery of any Adjustment Notice in accordance with the
foregoing. If an Adjustment Notice is delivered in accordance with the
foregoing and the final Adjusted Purchase Price is:

(i) mutually agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer during such thirty
(30) Business Day period or if Buyer does not deliver an Adjustment Notice
within the sixty (60) day period described above, the final Adjusted Purchase
Price shall be considered conclusive and binding on the Parties; or

(ii) not mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer during such thirty (30)
Business Day period described above, then the Parties shall mutually select an
internationally recognized, independent accounting firm (the " _Accountant_ ")
to resolve any disagreements. Should the Parties fail to agree on
an accounting firm within thirty (30) Business Days following the thirty (30)
Business Days period set forth in _Section 3.3(b)_ above or should such
accounting firm fail or refuse to agree to serve as the Accountant within
ten (10) days after written request from the Parties to serve and the Parties
fail to agree in writing on a replacement Accountant within five (5) days
after the end of that ten (10) day period, or should no replacement Accountant
agree to serve within fifteen (15) days after the original written request
pursuant to this sentence, the Accountant shall be appointed by the American
Arbitration Association. In connection with the engagement of the Accountant,
each of Seller and Buyer shall execute such engagement, indemnity and other
agreements as the Accountant and the American Arbitration Association shall
require as a condition to such engagement. The review and resolution of the
Parties disputes by the Accountant pursuant to this _Section 3.3(b)(ii)_
shall take place in Houston, Texas. The Accountant shall determine as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the selection
of the Accountant, based solely on (A) written submissions provided by Buyer
and Seller within ten (10) days following the Accountants selection to the
Accountant (and without independent investigation on the part of the
Accountant) and (B) the terms and provisions of this Agreement, whether and
to what extent (if any) Sellers Post-Closing Statement requires adjustment.
In resolving any disputed item, the Accountant shall act as an expert and not
an arbitrator and shall resolve only the items set forth in the Adjustment
Notice that are still in dispute and may not assign a value to any item
greater than the higher value for such item claimed by either Party or less
than the lower value for such item claimed by 

 



3  either Party. The Accountant may not award damages or penalties. Each Party
shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to the
Accountant, and one-half of the costs and expenses of the Accountant and the
American Arbitration Association incurred in resolving such disputed matters.
The determination of the Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties. The date on which the final Adjusted Purchase Price is finally
determined in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)(i)_ or this _Section
3.3(b)(ii)_ is referred to as the " _Determination Date_."

 

(c) Any difference in the Closing Payment and the final Adjusted Purchase
Price shall be paid by the owing Party to the owed Party within five (5)
Business Days of the Determination Date. Any post-Closing payment pursuant to
this _Section 3.3_ shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of
payment at the Agreed Rate.

 

(d) Buyer shall reasonably assist Seller in Sellers preparation of the Post-
Closing Statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price under  _Section 3.3(b)_, by
furnishing relevant information in Buyers possession, reasonable access to
personnel and such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by Seller
to facilitate such process post-Closing, which access to personnel shall not
unreasonably disrupt Buyers day-to-day operations.

(e) All payments (including the Deposit) made or to be made under this
Agreement by one Party to the other Party shall be made by electronic transfer
of immediately available funds to the receiving Partys account set forth in
_Schedule 3.3(e)_ , or to such other bank and account as may be specified by
the receiving Party in writing to the paying Party.

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that is not
specifically directed at any such Persons and (ii) the hiring of any Person

associated therewith), and any variations and derivatives thereof and
any logos, trademarks or trade names relating thereto from the Hydrocarbon
Interests and all other assets of the Acquired Companies. Buyer shall have no
right to use such names or marks (including any variations and/or derivatives
thereof) or any logos, trademarks or trade names relating thereto. The
foregoing notwithstanding, to the extent the name "SandRidge" (and all marks
associated therewith), and any variations and derivatives thereof and any
logos, trademarks or trade names relating thereto, is not currently marked on
the Hydrocarbon Interests, wells or Facilities of the Acquired Companies or is
not currently included in any SEMS plan, offshore spill response plan, or

sentence of this _Section 6.7(a)_. Nothing in this _Section 6.7(a)_ shall
require Seller (or, prior to Closing, any Acquired Company) to take any
action (or refrain from taking any action) if doing so would be reasonably
expected to cause it to be in breach of Law.

 

(b) Within seven (7) days following the Closing, Buyer shall cause each of

Acquired Company) for pickup from Sellers offices during normal business
hours; _provided_ that (a) Seller (and its Affiliates) may retain copies of
all or any portion thereof and (b) such books and records shall exclude any
files, records, contracts or documents of any Acquired Company or Seller
relating to negotiating the purchase and sale of the Purchased Equity,
including any bids or offers received by Seller or the Acquired Companies for
the sale of the Purchased Equity or the Hydrocarbon Interests in competition
with Buyers bid or offer, it being agreed that all such competing bids or
offers shall be the sole property of Seller. In no event shall Buyer or any of
its Affiliates destroy any books and records of any Acquired Company without
giving Seller sixty (60) days advance written notice thereof and the
opportunity, at Sellers expense, to obtain such books and records prior to
their destruction unless in accordance with Buyers records retention and
destruction policy.

 

Section 6.9 _Casualty and Condemnation_.

 

(a) In the event of a Casualty Loss, to the extent insurance proceeds,
condemnation awards or other payments are not committed, used or applied by
Seller prior to the Closing Date to repair, restore or replace such damaged or
taken Hydrocarbon Interests, Seller shall at the Closing pay to Buyer all
insurance proceeds, condemnation proceeds, awards and payments theretofore
paid to Seller by reason of such Casualty Loss. Any insurance proceeds,
condemnation proceeds, awards and payments paid to Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller (excluding Acquired Companies) after Closing by reason of a Casualty
Loss of Hydrocarbon Interests, shall be paid to Buyer promptly upon receipt
by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any insurance proceeds, condemnation
proceeds, awards and payments (or any rights thereto) by reason of a Casualty
Loss that are held by or owed to Seller for the account or benefit of any
third Person joint interest owners shall not be paid by Seller to Buyer
pursuant to this _Section 6.9_ and shall instead be transferred to the
successor operator or other Person responsible therefor pursuant to the terms
of the applicable operating or other agreement. All payments required to be
made by Seller to Buyer after Closing pursuant to this _Section 6.9(a)_ shall
be net of all reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller
(or any of its Affiliates, excluding the Acquired Companies) in collecting the
same.

(b) From and after Closing, Seller shall reasonably cooperate and comply (at
Buyers sole cost and expense) with Buyers reasonable written directions and
instructions with respect to Sellers pursuit of the collection (under
Sellers, or its Affiliates insurance policies) of any insurance proceeds
attributable to, or otherwise asserted to be payable with respect to, any
Casualty Loss.

Section 6.10 _Bonds and Guarantees_.

(a) After Closing and until the earlier to occur of (i) the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing and (ii) such time any Acquired Company is exempt
from the supplemental bonding requirements of BOEM and the BOEM releases
Seller from its financial guarantee (such period, the " _Seller Assistance_  

 



20   _Period_ "), Seller shall continue to provide the Seller Parent Financial
Guarantee to BOEM with respect to the supplemental bonding requirements of the
Acquired Companies. During such period, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to
cause each of the Acquired Companies to become exempt from the supplemental
bonding requirements of BOEM and shall provide Seller with updates on its
progress promptly upon Sellers request. During the Seller Assistance Period,
Buyer shall use its best efforts to ensure BOEM seeks any damages first
against Buyer before the Seller Parent Financial Guarantee, and Buyer shall
indemnify Seller (and its Affiliates and the other Seller
Indemnified Persons) from and against any and all Covered Liabilities
incurred by Seller (or any of the other Seller Indemnified Persons) as a
result of BOEM collecting any amounts from Seller under the Seller Parent
Financial Guarantee for obligations of the Acquired Companies (the foregoing
described indemnity obligation, " _Buyer BOEM Indemnity_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Seller and Buyer, as the
case may be, shall be permitted (but shall have no obligation) (i) in the
case of Seller, to offset the amount of any then outstanding indemnity
obligations it has to Buyer or any of the other Buyer Indemnified Persons
pursuant to _Section 11.2_ by the amount of any then outstanding Buyer BOEM
Indemnity obligations and (ii) in the case of Buyer, to offset the amount of
any then outstanding Buyer BOEM Indemnity obligations by the amount of any
then outstanding indemnity obligations Seller has to Buyer or any of the
other Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section 11.2_.

(b) _Schedule 4.2(x)_ identifies the bonds and letters of credit and other
forms of financial assurance posted (or supported) by Seller, the Acquired
Companies or any other Affiliate of Seller with respect to the Hydrocarbon
Interests that will be in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Except
with respect to the escrow accounts set forth on _Schedule 6.10(b)_ , the
Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit and other forms
of financial assurance, if any, posted by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
(including the Acquired Companies to the extent Seller or its Affiliates
(except any of the Acquired Companies) provide credit support for any such
bonds, letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance) with any
Governmental Authority or third Person and relating to the Hydrocarbon
Interests are to be transferred to Buyer. Except with respect to the escrow
accounts set forth on _Schedule 6.10(b)_ , Buyer shall (i) obtain or cause to
be obtained in the name of Buyer or its designee, replacements for the bonds,
letters of credit and other forms of financial assurance identified on
_Schedule 4.2(x)_ and (ii) cause, effective as of the Closing or as soon as
practicable thereafter, the cancellation or return to Seller of such
bonds, letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance, and Seller
shall provide reasonable cooperation to Buyer (at no out-of-pocket cost to
Seller) in connection therewith. Buyer may also provide evidence (reasonably
acceptable to Seller) that such replacements are not necessary as a result of
existing bonds, letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance that
Buyer has previously posted as long as such existing bonds, letters of credit
or other forms of financial assurance are adequate to secure the release of
those posted (or supported) by Seller.

(c) With respect to the escrow accounts set forth on _Schedule 6.10(b)_ and
the amounts of escrowed funds held therein, the Parties agree that such escrow
accounts (and the amounts therein) shall remain in place after the Closing
Date and for a period of one year from the Closing Date (or, if earlier,
the date on which such escrow account is replaced with substitute financial
assurance). On the first anniversary of the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the
date on which such escrow account is replaced with substitute financial
assurance), Buyer shall cause an amount of cash to be disbursed to, or to be
paid to, Seller, or its designee, equal to one-half of the total amounts set
forth on _Schedule 6.10(b)_ , which the Parties agree is equal to $13,976,721,
_plus_ any interest accrued thereon, and minus one-half of the escrow fees
and expenses applicable thereto, from the Effective Date until the date of
payment to Seller, or its designee.

 

Section 6.11 _Third Party Approvals_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) make or cause to be made the
filings required of such Party or any of its Affiliates under any Laws with

due of it in

 



21  connection with such filings, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and

applicable, any other Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as is reasonably practicable, (iv) promptly inform

such other Party) any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda)
from or to, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental
Authority in respect of such filings, (v) consult and cooperate with the
other Party in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,

Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (viii) use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist

contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of any Law. If a Party or any
of its Affiliates intends to participate in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority with respect to such filings or the transactions

timely filed and will provide a copy thereof to Seller.

22 (b) _Proration of Straddle Period Taxes_. In the case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes
that is attributable to the portion of the period ending prior to the

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with production, severance or any
sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible
or intangible), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax
period of the Acquired Companies ended immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets of any Acquired Company, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for

multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the portion of the period ending on the day immediately prior to the

(c) _Cooperation_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a " _Tax
Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
Acquired Companies. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other Partys request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional

further agrees, upon request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain

included as a Current Asset in the determination of Effective Time Net
Working Capital, as ultimately determined pursuant to _Article 3_. The amount
of any refunds of Taxes of any Acquired Company for any Tax period beginning
after the Effective Time shall be for the account of Buyer. The amount of any
refund of Taxes of any Acquired Company for any Straddle Period shall be
equitably apportioned between Buyer and Seller in accordance with the
principles set forth in _Section 6.12(b)_. Each Party shall forward, and
shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the Party entitled to receive a

sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes, or any conveyance
fees, recording charges or other similar fees and charges will be incurred or
imposed with respect to the transactions described in this Agreement
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). In the event any Transfer Taxes are
due, such Transfer Taxes shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. Buyer
and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent
permissible under Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

 



23 (g) _Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Buyer agree that

DBH, LLC, Bandon Oil and Gas GP, LLC, Bandon Oil and Gas, LP and SPN
Resources, LLC (the " _Flow-Through Entities_ "). Seller and Buyer further
agree that such treatment will result in SHI being treated as selling the
stock of Galveston Bay Pipeline Company, Galveston Bay Processing
Corporation, and Dynamic Offshore Resources NS Acquisition, Inc.
(collectively, the " _Purchased Corporations_ "). The Parties agree that the
Purchase Price and any assumed obligations treated for federal income
Tax purposes as consideration for a sale transaction (collectively, the "
_Allocable Amount_ ") shall be allocated among (i) the stock of each Purchased
Corporation and (ii) the assets of the Flow-Through Entities (other than
the stock of the Purchased Corporations), for federal and applicable state
income Tax purposes. Buyer and Seller shall agree on the allocation of the
Allocable Amount (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, and such allocation shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with the Allocated Values to the extent permitted by Law.
The Allocation Schedule shall be updated to reflect any adjustments to the
Allocable Amount. The allocation of the Allocable Amount shall be reflected
on a completed Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement
under Section 1060), which Form will be timely filed separately by Buyer and
Seller with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the requirements of
Section 1060(b) of the Code. Each Party agrees not to take any position
inconsistent with the allocations set forth in the Allocation Schedule unless
required by Law or with the consent of the other Party.

including the Closing Date and (D) SEI shall provide a copy of the Section
336(e) statements described in clause (C) to each Electing Entity on or before
the due date for filing the SEI consolidated federal income Tax Return (and
any corresponding state or local income Tax Returns) for the Tax year
including the Closing Date, as required by Treasury Regulations Sections
1.336-2(h)(1)(iv). Each of Seller and Buyer agree to cause the Electing
Companies to file a Form 8883 pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.336-2(h)(7) in a manner consistent with the allocation agreed upon pursuant
to Section 6.11(h)(iii). Seller and Buyer shall take all necessary steps to
properly make a Section 336(e) Election in accordance with Law (and any
corresponding provisions under state, local or foreign Law).

(ii) Seller and each Electing Company shall report the transfers under this
Agreement consistent with such Section 336(e) Election and shall take no
position contrary thereto. Seller and Buyer agree that any income and gain
recognized as a result of, and in accordance with, the making of the Section
336(e) Election will be included in the federal income Tax Return of the
Seller Consolidated Group for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date.
Seller will pay the Taxes attributable to the making of the Section
336(e) Election and will indemnify Buyer and each Acquired Company against
any failure to pay such Tax.

 



24 (iii) The computation of the "aggregate deemed asset disposition price"

the Electing Companies shall be prepared in accordance with Section 336(e)
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Buyer and Seller shall

holders of any applicable Preferential Rights that are set forth in _Schedule

after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, requesting waivers
of such rights. Prior to Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Transfer Requirements (and any fees payable in
connection therewith) and waivers of Preferential Rights (or the exercise
thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing; _provided, however_ ,
that Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to make payments or
undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in
order to obtain the Transfer Requirements (and any fees payable in connection
therewith).

 



25 (b) Should the holder of any Preferential Right set forth in _Schedule 4.2(o)_
, or that are identified to Seller or any of the Acquired Companies after the

(whether before or after the Closing), then:

 

(i) To the extent that the Allocated Values set forth in this Agreement or the

applicable Preferential Right;

 

(ii) Seller shall cause the applicable Acquired Company, as owner of the
applicable asset, before the Closing, and Buyer shall cause the applicable

Seller, provided services to any of the Acquired Companies during 2013
pursuant to any master service agreements, master vessel agreements, flight
service agreements, drilling agreements, consulting agreements, similar

Closing, Seller and Buyer will reasonably cooperate to cause the services
being provided to the Acquired Companies under such MSA to be transitioned to

_Section 11.2_ (as provided therein), Buyer agrees to defend, indemnify
and hold harmless Seller (and the other Seller Indemnified Persons) from and

any fines or penalties imposed by any Governmental Authority and that are
attributable to the Acquired Companies operation of any of their respective
assets and properties during the period ending on the Closing Date other than

Section 11.3 _Indemnification and Defense Procedures_. Claims for
indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:

(a) If any Person who or which is entitled to seek indemnification under this
Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives notice of the assertion or
commencement of any claim asserted against an Indemnified Party by a third
Person (" _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
(i) notify the Party obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Agreement, (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third Party Claim and
(ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (" _Claim Notice_ ")
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, a copy of
all papers served with respect to such claim (if any), the Indemnified Partys
best estimate of the amount of Covered Liabilities attributable to the Third
Party Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for
indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim
Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such delay or omission.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at its sole cost
and expense, the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who

 



34  shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all
appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion
of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this  _Section 11.3(b)_. The
Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party; _provided further_ , that such
consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a
complete and unconditional general release by the third Person asserting the
claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim, (ii) the settlement
agreement does not contain any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any
business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates and (iii) the settlement
agreement does not create a financial or other obligation on the part of the
Indemnified Party or any other Person other than the Indemnifying Party. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim that
the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of any
reasonably related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party
Claim or any cross complaint against any Person and making the books and
records and personnel of the Indemnified Party reasonably available during
normal business hours. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 11.3(b)_, and the Indemnified
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit (in writing) its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section 11.3(b)_, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its
reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified Party is actually
entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the Third Party Claim
with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party. In
such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third Party
Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings;
_provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if indemnification is to
be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying
Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement
controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 11.3(c)_, and
the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
such participation.

 

(d) Any claim by an Indemnified Party for indemnification under this Agreement
that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be
asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably written notice thereof
within the time period described in _Section 9.1_. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will
include copies of all available material written evidence thereof and will
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of damages that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
will have a period of fifteen (15) Business Days within which to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim whether or not such period extends beyond the
applicable survival period set forth in _Section 9.1_ therefor. If
the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such fifteen (15) Business
Day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim,
in which event the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as
may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement.

Section 11.4 _Seller s General Liability Limitation_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, Seller shall
have no liability to Buyer or any of the other Buyer Indemnified Persons
pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ for any breach of any of

 



35  the representations and warranties (other than any of the Seller Fundamental
Representations for which limitations set forth in this _Section 11.4(a)_
shall not apply) (or the corresponding representations and warranties given
in Sellers Closing Certificate), until and unless (i) any individual Covered
Liability related to such breach exceeds $500,000 (such Covered Liability, a "
_DeMinimis Claim_ ") and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Covered Liabilities
attributable to any such breach of such representations or warranties that
exceed the DeMinimis Claim amount collectively exceeds an amount equal to two
percent (2%) of the Adjusted Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_ ") and then
only to the extent that the amount of all such Covered Liabilities exceeds the
Deductible.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, Seller shall
have no liability to Buyer or any of the other Buyer Indemnified Persons
pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ for any breach of a representation or warranty
by Seller (other than the Seller Fundamental Representations and the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in _Section 4.2(r)_
for which limitations set forth in this _Section 11.4(b)_ shall not apply)
(or the corresponding representations and warranties given in Sellers Closing
Certificate), to the extent that the aggregate amount of all Covered
Liabilities attributable to any breach of such representations or warranties
by Seller to which the Buyer Indemnified Persons are entitled to recover
indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2_ exceeds an amount equal to twenty
percent (20%) of the Adjusted Purchase Price.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, Seller shall
have no liability to Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Person (A) pursuant
to _Section 11.2_ (or any other indemnity provisions set forth in this
Agreement) to the extent that the aggregate amount of all Covered Liabilities
to which the Buyer Indemnified Persons are entitled to recover
indemnification thereunder exceeds the Adjusted Purchase Price and (B) for any
breach of the representation and warranty of Seller set forth in _Section
4.2(r)(iii)_ (or the corresponding representations and warranties given in
Sellers Closing Certificate) with respect to any Subject Well, Subject Unit
or Subject Lease to the extent the amount of all Covered Liabilities
attributable to such Subject Well, Subject Unit or Subject Lease,
together with all Covered Liabilities attributable to all other Subject
Wells, Subject Units and Subject Leases located in or otherwise associated
with the Subject Field in which the Subject Well, Subject Unit or Subject
Lease is located, exceeds the Allocated Value set forth on _Schedule 14.4_
for the Subject Field in which the Subject Well, Subject Unit or Subject Lease
is located. In addition to the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, for purposes
of calculating the amount of any Covered Liabilities associated with any
breach of the representation and warranty of Seller set forth in _Section
4.2(r)(iii)_ (or the corresponding representations and warranties given in
Sellers Closing Certificate), the Parties shall multiply (1) the Allocated
Value of the Subject Field set forth on _Schedule 14.4_ in which the
applicable Subject Well, Subject Unit or Subject Lease is located by (2) the
quotient (expressed as a decimal) obtained by dividing the Subject Well PV-10
Value of the applicable Subject Well (or, in the case of a breach of such
representation and warranty with respect to any Subject Unit or Subject
Lease, the Subject Well located on such Subject Unit or Subject Lease) _by_
the aggregate PV-10 Value of all Subject Wells included in such Subject Field.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, Seller shall
only have liability to Buyer and/or any other Buyer Indemnified Person
pursuant to _Section 11.2(d)(ii)_ to the extent of (and only to the extent
of) the amount of insurance proceeds (if any) that are actually received by
Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller) under any insurance policy (or
coverage) described in _Section 11.2(d)(ii)_ with respect to any Action
described in _Section 11.2(d)(ii)_, net of all reasonable third party costs
and expenses incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates in collecting any
such proceeds. 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, Seller shall
have no liability to make any payment to Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified
Person pursuant to _Section 11.2_ (or any other indemnity provisions set
forth in this Agreement) until such time as the Seller Assistance Period has

 



36  expired; _provided_ that this provision is only intended to toll, but not
eliminate the obligation of Seller to make such payments to Buyer or any other
Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to  _Section 11.2_, which payments (to the
extent required pursuant to _Section 11.2_) shall be made within five (5)
Business Days following the expiration of the Seller Assistance Period;
_provided_ , _further_ , that this provision shall not toll or otherwise
delay any of the periods set forth in _Article 9_ or _11_ with regard to Buyer
or any other Buyer Indemnified Persons right to indemnification under
_Section 11.2_. Further, this  _Section 11.4(e)_ shall not limit or
otherwise affect the obligations of Seller under _Section 11.3_ and shall
only operate to toll the payment of indemnified liabilities under _Section
11.2_, but not the obligation to defend or the payment of costs or expenses
thereof as set forth in _Section 11.3_.

(f) Each Buyer Indemnified Person shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate Covered Liabilities with respect to which a
claim for indemnification is made, including, in the case of Buyer (or any
other Buyer Indemnified Person), applying against any Covered Liability
claimed under _Section 11.2(e)_ all suspended funds in its (or any Acquired
Companys) possession that relate to the Royalty claim giving rise to such
Covered Liability when such Acquired Company is permitted to do so under Law
or applicable contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
amount of any Covered Liabilities incurred or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnified Person shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any
insurance proceeds (net of costs incurred in prosecuting the insurance claim)
actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates)
with respect to such Covered Liabilities and (ii) any recoveries actually
obtained by the Buyer Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) from any
other third Person. If any such proceeds, benefits or recoveries are received
by a Buyer Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to any
Covered Liabilities after Seller has made a payment to the Buyer Indemnified
Person with respect thereto, the Buyer Indemnified Person (or such Affiliate)
shall promptly pay to Seller the amount of such proceeds, benefits or
recoveries (up to the amount of Buyers payment).

 

(g) Each Seller Indemnified Person shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate Covered Liabilities with respect to which a
claim for indemnification is made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the amount of any Covered Liabilities incurred or suffered by any
Seller Indemnified Person shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any
insurance proceeds (net of costs incurred in prosecuting the insurance claim)
actually received by the Seller Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates)
with respect to such Covered Liabilities and (ii) any recoveries actually
obtained by the Seller Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) from any
other third Person. If any such proceeds, benefits or recoveries are received
by a Seller Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to any
Covered Liabilities after Buyer has made a payment to the Seller Indemnified
Person with respect thereto, the Seller Indemnified Person (or such Affiliate)
shall promptly pay to Buyer the amount of such proceeds, benefits or
recoveries (up to the amount of Sellers payment). Further, Seller agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the insurance coverages
described in _Section 11.2(d)(ii)_ in place, and timely submit all claims
upon notice from the Acquired Companies or Buyer, as applicable, for any
Actions subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(d)(ii)_ and to
cause the payment of all proceeds therefrom, subject to _Section 11.4(d)_, to
be paid to, or on behalf of, the Acquired Companies or Buyer, it being
understood and agreed that Seller (or its Affiliate) and Buyer shall (and
Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to) cooperate in the defense and
settlement of such Actions described in _Section 11.2(d)(ii)_,
which settlement shall be subject to the mutual consent of Seller and Buyer,
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Section 11.5  _Buyer s General Liability Limitation_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, except with
respect to breaches of Buyer Fundamental Representations for which the
limitations set forth in this _Section 11.5(a)_ shall not apply, Buyer shall
have no liability to Seller or any of the other Seller Indemnified Persons 

 



37  pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)_ for any breach of a representation or
warranty by Buyer until and unless (i) any individual Covered Liability or
group or series of related Covered Liabilities covered by _Section 11.1(a)_
attributable to any breach by Buyer of this Agreement is not a DeMinimis
Claim; _provided, however_ , that any group or series of Covered Liabilities
arising out of the same occurrence shall be aggregated and treated as an
individual Covered Liability for purposes of determining whether they are a
DeMinimis Claim and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Covered Liabilities
attributable to any breach of such representations or warranties by Buyer in
this Agreement exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent that the
amount of such Covered Liabilities exceeds the Deductible.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, Buyer shall have
no liability to Seller or any of the other Seller Indemnified Persons for any
breach of a representation or warranty by Buyer that is not a Buyer
Fundamental Representation to the extent that the aggregate amount of all
Covered Liabilities attributable to any breach of such representations or
warranties by Buyer to which the Seller Indemnified Persons shall be entitled
to recover indemnification under _Section 11.1_ exceeds an amount equal to
twenty (20%) of the Adjusted Purchase Price. In addition, Buyer shall have no
liability to Seller or any other Seller Indemnified Person for any breach of
a representation or warranty by Buyer that is a Buyer Fundamental
Representation to the extent that the aggregate amount of all Covered
Liabilities attributable to any breach of the representations or warranties
by Buyer to which the Seller Indemnified Persons have recovered under _Section
11.1_ exceeds the Adjusted Purchase Price.

 

(c) Each Seller Indemnified Person shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate Covered Liabilities with respect to which a
claim for indemnification is made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the amount of any Covered Liabilities incurred or suffered by any
Seller Indemnified Person shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any
insurance proceeds (net of costs incurred in prosecuting the insurance claim)
actually received by the Seller Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates)
with respect to such Covered Liabilities and (ii) any recoveries actually
obtained by the Seller Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) from any
other third Person. If any such proceeds or recoveries are received by a
Seller Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to any
Covered Liabilities after Buyer has made a payment to the Seller Indemnified
Person with respect thereto, the Seller Indemnified Person (or such Affiliate)
shall promptly pay to Buyer the amount of such proceeds, benefits or
recoveries (up to the amount of Buyers payment).

 

Section 11.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. The remedies provided in this _Article 11_
shall be the sole and exclusive legal remedies of the Parties (including any
claims by, through, under or against the Acquired Companies), from and after
the Closing, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 11.6_ shall prevent, after
Closing, either Party from seeking specific performance, injunctive and/or
equitable relief for claims of breach or failure to perform covenants
performable under this Agreement.

 

Section 11.7 _Buyer Knowledge_. Seller shall not be liable under this _Article
11_ for any Covered Liabilities suffered or incurred by a Buyer Indemnified
Person as a result of or arising out of any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement or Sellers Closing
Certificate to the extent that such inaccuracy or breach was known, prior to
the date hereof, by Buyer or the relevant Buyer Indemnified Person.

Section 11.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Except as
otherwise required by Law, any indemnification payments made pursuant to this
Agreement between the Parties shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE GROSS, SOLE, ACTIVE,
PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT
OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER AND SELLER
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND
IS " _CONSPICUOUS_."

ARTICLE 12

 

TERMINATION; REMEDIES

Section 12.1  _Termination_.

(a) _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

(i) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 

(ii) by either Party, if the Closing has not occurred by the close of business
on or before March 31, 2014 (as may be extended, the " _Drop-Dead Date_ ");
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
12.1(a)(ii)_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement shall have
been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before the Drop-Dead Date;

 

(iii) by Seller upon Buyers (A) breach of any of its representations or
warranties or (B) failure to comply with any of its covenants or agreements
contained herein, in each case, such that the either of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ shall not be satisfied by, or shall be
incapable of being satisfied by, the Drop-Dead Date; or

 

(iv) by Buyer upon Sellers (A) breach of any of its representations or
warranties or (B) failure to comply with any of its covenants or agreements
contained herein, in each case, such that the either of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ shall not be satisfied by, or shall be
incapable of being satisfied by, the Drop-Dead Date.

 

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Without limiting Sellers and Buyers respective
remedies and rights in regard to the Deposit under _Section 12.2_, in the
event of termination of this Agreement by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer,
on the other hand, pursuant to _Section 12.1(a)_, written notice thereof
shall forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Party, and
this Agreement shall thereupon terminate; _provided, however_ , that following
any termination of this Agreement, Buyer will continue to be bound by its
obligations set forth in _Sections 5.1(a)(ii)_ , _5.2_ and  _6.3(c)_ ;
_provided_ , _further_ , that (i) this _Section 12.1(b)_, _Section 10.3_ and
_Article 1_ and _Article 13_ will survive the termination of this Agreement
and will remain in full force and effect and (ii) subject to _Section 12.2_,
the termination of this Agreement will not relieve any Party from any
liability for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to termination. If
this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, all filings, applications
and other submissions made to any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
practicable, be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority to which they were
made.

 

Section 12.2 _Remedies_.

(a)  _Seller s Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, upon Buyers breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement such that Seller 

 



39  would be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
12.1(a)(iii)_, Seller may terminate this Agreement, retain the Deposit and,
upon written notice from Seller to Buyer, require Buyer to pay to Seller
(within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such notice) an amount equal to
$75,000,000 (such amount, together with the amount of the Deposit, the "
_Termination Payment_ "), as liquidated damages, as Sellers sole and
exclusive remedies against Buyer and the Debt Providers for such breach, all
other remedies (including the specific performance of any commitment letter or
other documentation pursuant to which the Debt Providers have committed to
provide or cause to be provided debt financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby) being expressly waived by Seller in such
event. Seller and Buyer agree upon the amount of the Termination Payment, as
liquidated damages, due to the difficulty and inconvenience of measuring
actual damages and the uncertainty thereof, and Seller and Buyer agree that
the Termination Amount is a reasonable estimate of Sellers loss in the event
of any such default by Buyer.

(b) _Buyer s Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon
Sellers breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement such that Buyer would be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 12.1(a)(iv)_, Buyer, at its sole option, may (i) enforce
specific performance of this Agreement or (ii) terminate this Agreement and
receive back the entirety of the Deposit as Buyers sole and exclusive remedy
for such default, all other remedies being expressly waived by Buyer. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated under _Section 12.1(a)_ and Buyer is
not entitled to retain the Deposit pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, Seller shall be entitled to retain the entirety of the Deposit.

 

(c) _Buyer s and Sellers Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything herein provided
to the contrary, upon termination of this Agreement by a Party pursuant to
_Section 12.1(a)(ii)_, Buyer shall receive back the entirety of the Deposit
as the sole and exclusive remedy for failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby by the Drop-Dead Date, all other remedies being expressly
waived by the Parties.

Section 12.3 _Return of Documentation and Confidentiality_. Upon termination
of this Agreement, Buyer shall return to Seller all title, engineering,

intention of the Parties, to

 



43  such Law, and to the extent such term, provision or condition cannot be so

legality and enforceability of the remaining terms, provisions and conditions

---|---|---|---|--- 
    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA |  | § |  | 
   |  | § |  | KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: 
  OFFSHORE [TEXAS] |  | § |  | 
 

This CONVEYANCE OF OVERRIDING ROYALTY INTEREST (this " _Conveyance_ "),
effective as of  , 2014, , at 12:01 a.m., Houston Time (the "
_Effective Time_ "), is made by [ ], a[n] [
], whose address is [ ] (" _Assignor_ "), to SandRidge
Exploration and Production, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,
whose address is 123 Robert S. Kerr Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73102 ("
_Assignee_ "). This Conveyance is executed and delivered in connection with
and pursuant to the terms of that certain Equity Purchase Agreement between
Assignor and SandRidge Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Assignee, dated
January 6, 2014 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ ").

For and in consideration of the sum of TEN AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($10.00), cash
in hand and other good and valuable consideration paid to Assignor by
Assignee, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
Assignor does hereby SELL, TRANSFER, GRANT, ASSIGN, CONVEY and DELIVER unto
Assignee an overriding royalty interest equal to two percent (2%) of 8/8ths
in, to and under: (i) each of the oil and gas leases, or portions thereof,
described on _Exhibit A_ insofar and only insofar as applicable to:

(a) with respect to the leases (or portions thereof) set forth in numbers 1
and 2 on _Exhibit A_ , the hydrocarbon-bearing intervals lying below the
depths as set forth on Exhibit B for such leases and below the salt interval
overhang; _provided_ , if an initial well is drilled to a hydrocarbon bearing
interval described above and such well is determined to be capable of
producing hydrocarbons in commercial quantities at the time of completion,
then the stratigraphic equivalent of such hydrocarbon-bearing intervals
(without regard to whether lying below the salt interval overhang) encountered
in any subsequent delineation wells drilled to down-dip locations from the
initial well; and

(b) with respect to the lease (or portion thereof) set forth in number 3 on
_Exhibit A_ , the depths described on _Exhibit B_ with respect thereto (such
depths identified in clauses (a) and (b) above, the " _Deep Rights_ ") (such
leases, or portions thereof, as so depth limited, the " _Leases_ ," and
individually a " _Lease_ ") and (ii) the oil, gas, condensate, other liquid or
gaseous hydrocarbons (collectively, the " _Hydrocarbons_ ") which may be
produced, saved and sold from such Leases (the interest described in clauses
(i) and (ii), the " _Overriding Royalty Interest_ ").

TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Overriding Royalty Interest onto Assignee, its
successors and assigns forever, subject to all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and orders of governmental authorities, the terms and provisions
of the Leases as currently in effect and the terms and provisions set forth
herein.

The Overriding Royalty Interest conveyed hereby is a non-operating, non-
expense-bearing overriding royalty interest in the nature of an interest in
real property, free of all cost, risk and expense of production and operations
(including all drilling, developing and operating costs and expenses);
_provided_ that the valuation of the Hydrocarbons attributable to, the costs  and deductions allowed to reduce payments attributable to, and the payment
of royalties payable with respect to, the Overriding Royalty Interest shall be
made in the same manner and under the same conditions as is provided in said
Leases and the rules and regulations of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
of the United States Department of Interior, or any successor agency (the "
_BOEM_ "), for the payment and delivery of royalties to the lessors under the
applicable Lease. Except as expressly provided in this Conveyance, in no event
shall Assignee ever be liable or responsible in any way for the payment of any
costs, expenses or liabilities (a) attributable to the Leases (or any part
thereof) or the Overriding Royalty Interest, or (b) incurred in connection
with the production or saving of Hydrocarbons produced therefrom or otherwise
related thereto.

 

The Overriding Royalty Interest shall be free of (and without deduction
therefrom of) any and all royalties and other burdens on production and shall
bear no part of the same, and shall be without deduction for the cost of
gathering, storing, separating, treating, dehydrating, compressing and
otherwise making the Hydrocarbons produced and saved from the Leases ready for
the sale or use, except to the extent otherwise allowed by, or provided in,
the rules and regulations of the BOEM. Assignors retained leasehold interests
shall be burdened with, and Assignor shall be responsible for the timely
payment of, all such royalties, overriding royalties and other burdens on
production, and Assignor shall defend, indemnify and hold Assignee and its
affiliates harmless from and against any loss or claim with respect to any
such royalties, overriding royalties or other burdens on production or any
claim by the owners or holders of such royalties, overriding royalties or
other burdens on production.

Assignor warrants and defends all and singular title to the Overriding
Royalty Interest attributable to the Leases described in number 3 on _Exhibit
A_ and the Hydrocarbons produced therefrom unto Assignee against every person
whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same by, through or under
Assignor but not otherwise.

__The Overriding Royalty Interest shall be applicable to any renewal or
extension of any Lease; _provided_ that no obligations, express or implied,
shall arise by reason of the assignment of the Overriding Royalty Interest to
obligate Assignor to maintain the Leases in effect either by payment of delay
rentals, compensatory royalties or other payments, or the drilling of any
wells on the lands subject to the Leases. Assignor is specifically empowered
with the right and authority to release all or any part of the Leases without
the necessity of Assignees joinder in any release; _provided_ that the
Overriding Royalty Interest shall be applicable to any substitute, replacement
or new lease covering the same property, horizons and minerals taken or
acquired by Assignor, its affiliates or their respective successors or
assigns within two years after the date of such release. __

__Any assignment conveyance or other transfer of Assignor s interests in the
Leases or any part thereof shall be made and accepted expressly subject and
subordinate to this Conveyance and the Overriding Royalty Interest. Assignee
may freely transfer, assign or convey all or any portion of the Overriding
Royalty Interest; _provided_ that no such transfer, assignment or conveyance
shall be binding on Assignor until the receipt by Assignor of proper evidence
of such transfer, assignment or conveyance. __

 



2 This Conveyance is an absolute conveyance of an interest in real and/or
immovable property. The provisions of this Conveyance shall run with the land
and the respective interests of Assignor and Assignee therein and shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of Assignor and Assignee and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

This Conveyance shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance
with the internal laws of the State of Texas, excluding any conflict-of-laws
rule or principle that might refer the governance, construction or
interpretation of this Conveyance to the law of another jurisdiction.

 

This Conveyance may not be modified or amended except by an instrument or
instruments in writing signed by Assignor and Assignee.

 

Assignor will execute and deliver all such other and additional instruments,
notices, releases, acquittances and other documents and will do all such
other acts and things, as may be necessary to more fully assure to Assignee
all of the rights and interests herein and hereby granted or intended so to
be.

 

It is the intent of Assignor and Assignee that no provision herein violate any
applicable law regarding the rule against perpetuities, the suspension of the
absolute power of alienation, or other rules regarding the vesting or duration
of estates, and this Conveyance shall be construed as not violating such rules
to the extent the same can be so construed consistent with the intent of the
parties. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Conveyance, if any right,
interest or estate in property granted by this Conveyance or pursuant hereto
does not vest upon the date hereof, such right, interest or estate shall vest
not later than twenty-one (21) years less one (1) day after the death of the
last surviving descendant of Joseph P. Kennedy, father of John F. Kennedy,
former President of the United States of America, who is living on the date of
execution of the Conveyance by Assignor.

This Conveyance contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and there are no agreements, understandings,
representations or warranties between the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof other than those set forth or referred to herein.

 

This Conveyance may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each
counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such
counterparts together shall constitute but one conveyance. Further, the this
Conveyance may be recorded in multiple jurisdictions, including the records of
the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the parish and county records
adjacent to where the Leases are situated and all such recordings of this
Conveyance shall constitute but one conveyance and not multiple conveyances of
separate overriding royalty interests in the Leases.

 _TRANSITION AGREEMENT_

 

THIS TRANSITION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into and made
effective as of  _[ ]_, 2014 (the " _Effective Date_ ") between
SandRidge Operating Company, a Texas corporation, with an address of 123
Robert S. Kerr Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73102 (" _Provider_ "), and
FIELDWOOD ENERGY LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, with an address of
2000 W. Sam Houston Pkwy South, Suite 1200, Houston, Texas 77042 (" _Buyer_
"). Provider and Buyer are sometimes referred to herein individually as a "
_Party_ ," and collectively as the " _Parties_."

WHEREAS, SandRidge Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an Affiliate of
Provider (" _SEI_ "), and SandRidge Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
an Affiliate of Provider (" _SHI_ ," referred to collectively with SEI as "
_Seller_ "), and Buyer entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the "
_Equity Purchase Agreement_ "), dated as of January 6, 2014, under which
Seller agreed to sell, and Buyer agreed to purchase, Sellers equity in the
Acquired Companies (as defined below);

WHEREAS, prior to the Effective Date, Provider provided certain marketing,
land administration and accounting services for the Acquired Companies; and

WHEREAS, to effect an orderly transfer of the Acquired Companies and related
assets and operations from Seller to Buyer, Buyer desires that Provider
provide certain Services (as hereinafter defined) to Buyer in connection with
the Acquired Companies, during the period from the Effective Date until the
Termination Date (as hereinafter defined) (the " _Transition Period_ "), in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

 

1\. _DEFINITIONS_. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized
terms in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Equity
Purchase Agreement.

2\. _SCOPE OF SERVICES_. Effective as of Effective Date, and subject to the
reasonable instruction of Buyer, Provider shall provide to Buyer the
marketing, land administration and accounting services with respect to the
Acquired Companies, substantially consistent with the similar services
provided by Provider with respect to the Acquired Companies in the ordinary
course of business immediately prior to the Effective Date. The marketing,
land administration and accounting services (each as more particularly
described below) shall be referred to individually as the " _Service_ " and
collectively as the " _Services_."

Provider shall perform all Services under this Agreement under the
reasonable instruction of Buyers personnel and shall be entitled to rely
upon any written or oral instructions received from Buyers designated
representatives relating to the Services. During the Transition Period,
Provider shall provide sufficient personnel with appropriate background and
experience as may be reasonably necessary to perform the Services in a timely
manner.

The Services to be provided by Provider to Buyer hereunder are as follows:

(a) _Marketing_. During the Transition Period, Provider shall provide
marketing, hydrocarbon control, hydrocarbon scheduling, and contract
administration services as reasonably requested by Buyer necessary to sell
Hydrocarbons from the Hydrocarbon Interests (collectively, the "
_Marketing Services_ "). During the period in which Provider is providing
such Marketing Services, Provider shall provide Buyer  with monthly summaries of the quantities of the Hydrocarbons scheduled and
sold for such periods and plant statements (and corresponding hydrocarbon
wells) associated with Hydrocarbon production from the Hydrocarbon Interests.
Unless extended by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Provider, Buyer shall
assume all Marketing Services beginning with the production month of May 2014;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Provider shall provide such reasonable
assistance as requested by Buyer after Buyer assumes the marketing functions
and the costs of such further assistance incurred by Provider shall be borne
solely by Buyer. All hydrocarbon nominations required for the production
month for which Buyer shall assume Marketing Services shall be made by Buyer.
During the Transition Period, Provider may sell Hydrocarbons from the
Hydrocarbon Interests to Providers Affiliate marketing companies without
liability to Buyer relating to or arising out of such sales, _provided_ that
the prices obtained by Provider with respect to such sales shall be equivalent
to the prices that Provider or its applicable Affiliate(s) would otherwise
have obtained from a third party in a substantially similar arms-length
transaction. To the extent Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates receives
proceeds from the sale (from and after the Effective Time) of Hydrocarbons or
any other proceeds attributable to the Acquired Companies or the Hydrocarbon
Interests, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to (i) promptly remit
such proceeds to the applicable Acquired Company and (ii) account to Buyer
with respect to such proceeds in order to provide Buyer with reasonable
information regarding the origin thereof.

(b) _Land Administration Services_. During the Transition Period, Provider
shall provide, under the reasonable instruction of Buyer, all lease, division
order and other land administration services (collectively, the " _Land
Administration Services_ ") as follows:

 

(i) administering and maintaining all leases and agreements relating to the
Hydrocarbon Interests;

 

(ii) maintaining and updating all lease, ownership, contract and property
records and databases relating to the Hydrocarbon Interests;

 

(iii) maintaining and updating all royalty payment and division order reports
and databases;

 

(iv) generating, verifying, processing, approving and signing ( _provided_
that Buyer and/or the applicable Acquired Company have granted Provider a
special power of attorney authorizing Provider to sign on behalf of such
applicable Person) all internal and external division orders and transfer
orders required in the normal course of business;

 

(v) identifying, paying and appropriately invoicing all rentals, rights of
way, shut-in payments and other payments required by the leases or other
agreements relating to the Hydrocarbon Interests;

(vi) maintaining all land, contract, division of interest, lease files, and
other files relating to the subject land administration functions as well as
maintaining any imaging and indexing of such records in the ordinary course of
business; and

 

(vii) performing such other reasonable and customary land administration
services as Provider deems necessary to administer or maintain the leases or
agreements relating to the Hydrocarbon Interests.

 



2 (c) _Accounting Services_. During the Transition Period, Provider shall
provide, at the reasonable instruction of Buyer, revenue and expense
accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
for services relating to the Hydrocarbon Interests (collectively, the "
_Accounting Services_ ") as follows:

(i) Provider shall perform all revenue accounting functions relating to the
Hydrocarbon Interests, including the disbursement of revenue proceeds to all
working interest, third party, royalty and overriding royalty owners as well
as all rental, severance or production taxes and right of way payments and any
and all leasehold, minimum or advance payments due in the normal course of
business.

(ii) Provider shall comply with all state and federal regulatory reporting and
filing requirements, including any reports required by the regulatory
agencies (including the BOEM and/or Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement).

(iii) Provider shall perform all expenditure accounting functions relating to
the Hydrocarbon Interests, including the payment of all invoices and
subsequent billing of same to all working interest owners.

 

(iv) Provider shall prepare monthly gas and oil balancing and payout
statements.

 

(v) Provider shall provide any system support services necessary to extract
electronic data of accounting, lease, division of interest and production
information where currently available from Sellers operational systems in
Sellers current format or other reasonable format as requested by Buyer.

 

(vi) To the extent known by Seller, Provider shall provide all information and
documentation to allow Buyer to identify all known parties for which Seller
is currently holding funds in suspense for the period from Effective Date to
Termination Date, together with the production history attributable to such
funds and such other information as reasonably necessary to allow Buyer to
assume payment obligations and/or discharge its legal requirements to timely
escheat such funds to any applicable governmental agencies for such funds.

 

(vii) Provider shall provide sufficient electronic data (to the extent such
electronic data is currently available) to provide for the allocation of
facility and/or field costs.

Buyer shall cooperate with Provider by disclosing to Provider Buyers receipt
of monies and payment of invoices during the Transition Period.

3\. _LIMITATION ON SERVICES_.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Provider is not

or in a manner substantially different from, the manner in which Provider
performed such Services for the account of Seller or Provider (or for the
account of any Acquired Company) immediately prior to the Effective Date.
Buyer shall have no right at any time to control or supervise Provider or its
employees in their performance hereunder or as to the manner, means, or method
in which the Services are performed, and Buyer shall have no authority to

means and method of performing the Services shall be under the control of
Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Provider may, but will not be

pay any amounts on Buyers (or any Acquired Companys) behalf (or for Buyers
or any Acquired Companys account) unless and until sufficient funds covering
such amounts have been made available to Provider (by Buyer).

 

5\. _TERMINATION_.

situation as quickly as possible.
