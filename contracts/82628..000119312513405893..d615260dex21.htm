(a) _Provided_ , that this Agreement shall not have terminated in accordance
with its terms and provided that none of the events set forth in clause
(iii)(a) of Annex A shall have occurred and subject to there being no order,
decree, judgment, injunction or ruling of a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting
the commencement of the Offer and no Law having been enacted, entered,
enforced, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed applicable to Parent, the
Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof having such effect, Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but no later than seven (7) business days (commencing with the
first business day after the date of this Agreement), after the date hereof.
Following such launch, each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof.

 



-12- (b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment, purchase and pay for
any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn)
shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver pursuant to the terms hereof of
(x) the condition (the "Minimum Condition") that at least that number of
Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration
date of the Offer (other than Company Shares tendered by guaranteed delivery
where actual delivery has not occurred), when added to any Company Shares
already owned by Parent or any of its controlled subsidiaries, if any, equal
a majority of the sum of the then outstanding Company Shares plus (without
duplication) a number equal to the number of Company Shares issuable upon the
vesting (including vesting solely as a result of the consummation of the
Offer), conversion, settlement or exercise of all then outstanding warrants,
options, benefit plans, obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable
into Common Shares, or other rights to acquire or be issued Common
Shares (including then outstanding Company Stock Options and Company RSUs,
assuming the effectiveness thereof occurred on the Expiration Date), in each
case, with an exercise or conversion price below the Per Share Amount and (y)
the other conditions set forth in Annex A hereto (the conditions described in
clauses (x) and (y) are collectively referred to as the "Tender Offer
Conditions"). Purchaser expressly reserves the right (but shall not be
obligated) at any time or from time to time, in its sole discretion, to amend
or waive any such condition (other than the Minimum Condition which may not be
amended or waived), to increase the price per Company Share payable in the
Offer, and to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer; _provided_ , that without the prior written consent of the Company no
change may be made that decreases the Per Share Amount (except as provided in
Section 2.1(i)), changes the form of consideration payable in the Offer, adds
to the conditions to the Offer, extends the Offer other than as set forth in
this Section 2.1, decreases the number of Company Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, extends the Offer other than in a manner pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms of Section 2.1(d), or modifies or amends any
condition to the Offer in any manner that broadens such conditions or is
adverse to the holders of Company Shares.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall remain open
until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the twentieth (20th)
business day beginning with (and including) the date that the Offer is
commenced (determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) (the "Expiration Date"), unless the period of time for which the Offer
is open shall have been extended pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
provisions of Section 2.1(d) or as required by applicable Laws or the
interpretations of the SEC (in which event the term "Expiration Date" shall
mean the latest time and date as the Offer, as so extended, may expire).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
with Section 9.1, (i) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff
or the Nasdaq Stock Market that is applicable to the Offer, and (ii) if, on
the initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is
scheduled to expire, any Tender Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived, then Purchaser shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its
expiration date beyond the initial

 



-13-  Expiration Date or such subsequent date for successive extension periods of
up to 10 business days each (each such extension period, an "Additional Offer
Period");  _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 2.1(d), (A) if any of the events set
forth in clause (iii)(a) of Annex A shall have occurred on or before the
initial Expiration Date or the end of any Additional Offer Period, in no
event shall Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond the Initial
Expiration Date or end of such Additional Offer Period, as applicable; (B) if,
at the initial Expiration Date or the end of any Additional Offer Period, all
of the Tender Offer Conditions, except for the Minimum Condition, are
satisfied or have been waived, Purchaser shall only be required to extend the
Offer and its expiration date beyond the initial Expiration Date or such
subsequent date for one or more additional periods not to exceed an aggregate
of 20 business days, to permit the Minimum Condition to be satisfied; and (C)
in no event shall Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Outside Date; _provided_ _further_ , that the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)
of this Section 2.1(d) shall not be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1.

(e) If the Acceptance Date occurs, but there has been a 251(h) Inapplicable
Determination, and the number of Company Shares that have been validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer, together with any Company
Shares then owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent (assuming exercise of
the Top-Up Option in full and excluding from such ownership Company Shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee), is less than 90%
of the outstanding Shares, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion without the
consent of the Company, provide for one subsequent offering period immediately
following the Acceptance Date (as provided in Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act) of not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) business days
(determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension provided for in this Section
2.1(e) shall extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered during such subsequent offering period,
as promptly as practicable after any such shares of Company Common Stock are
tendered during such subsequent offering period. Purchaser shall not terminate
the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written
consent of the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, Purchaser shall not (and Parent shall cause Purchaser not to)
commence any "subsequent offering period" after the Acceptance Date if the
Merger can be effected pursuant to either (i) Section 251(h) of the DGCL or
(ii) Section 253 of the DGCL.

(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any
event within twenty four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer.

 

(g) The Per Share Amount shall, subject to applicable withholding of taxes, be
net to the applicable seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Purchaser or Parent on Purchasers

 



-14-  behalf shall accept for payment and pay for all Company Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn promptly following the expiration of the Offer (the
time and date of the acceptance for payment, the "Acceptance Date");
provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not accept for payment or pay for any Company Shares if, as a
result, Purchaser would acquire less than the number of Company Shares
necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. If payment of the Per Share Amount
is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
certificate formerly evidencing Company Shares is registered on the
stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that
the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Per Share Amount to a person other than the registered holder
of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction
of Purchaser that such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

(h) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO")
with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate
by reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") and form of the
related letter of transmittal and any other ancillary documents pursuant to
which the Offer will be made (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such
other documents, together with all exhibits, supplements and amendments
thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents").
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents
to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares in all material respects to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for use in
the Offer Documents that shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated
to holders of Company Shares, in each case in all material respects as
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Purchaser or Parent all information concerning the Company that is
required or reasonably requested by Purchaser or Parent in connection with
their obligations relating to the Offer Documents or any action contemplated
by this Section 2.1(h). Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO
before it is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Company and
its counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser agree to (i) provide the
Company and its counsel in writing with any written comments Parent, Purchaser
or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments,
(ii) use reasonable best efforts to provide a reasonably detailed description
of any oral comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time
to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after the receipt of such comments, and (iii) unless there has been
a Change of Recommendation, provide the Company and its counsel reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any written or oral response to such
comments or any proposed amendment to the Offer Documents prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC.

 



-15- (i) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Date, the
outstanding Company Shares are changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or similar transaction, then the Per Share Amount applicable
to such Company Share shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate.

2.2 Company Action.

 

(a) The Company hereby consents to and approves the Offer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. The Company hereby further consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of such approval and of the determination and
recommendation of the Company Board described in Section 4.4(b). The Company
shall not withdraw or modify such recommendation in any manner adverse to
Purchaser or Parent except as provided in Section 7.5(c).

(b) Promptly following the filing of the Schedule TO by Purchaser, the
Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9") containing, except as provided in Section 7.5(c),
the recommendation of the Company Board described in Section 4.4(b). The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
be filed with the SEC on the same day as the Schedule TO shall be filed with
the SEC. The Company shall promptly mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of
Company Shares together with the Offer Documents and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated in all material
respects as required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of federal securities laws.
The Company, Parent and Purchaser agree to correct promptly any information
provided by any of them for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected,
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in
each case in all material respects as required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent or Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company
all information concerning Parent and Purchaser that is required or reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with its obligations relating to the
Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall give Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it
is filed with the SEC. In addition, the Company agrees to (i) provide Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel in writing with any written comments the Company
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments,
(ii) use reasonable best efforts to provide Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel a reasonably detailed description of any oral comments the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, and
(iii) unless there has been a Change of Recommendation, provide Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any written or oral response to such comments or any proposed amendment to the
Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.

 



-16- (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished (including by instructing its transfer agent to promptly
furnish) to Purchaser mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Company Shares and with security position listings of
Company Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together
with all other available listings and computer files containing names,
addresses and security position listings of record holders and non-objecting
beneficial owners of Company Shares. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser such
additional information, including updated listings and computer files of
stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other
assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of Company Shares
as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request. Subject to the requirements of
Law, including applicable stock exchange rules, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Purchaser shall
hold in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings
and files and shall use such information only in connection with the
Transactions. If the Offer is terminated or if this Agreement shall be
terminated, Purchaser and Parent will promptly deliver and cause their
Representatives to deliver to the Company (and delete electronic copies of)
all copies, summaries and extracts of such information then in their
possession or control.

2.3 Top-Up Option. Prior to the scheduled Acceptance Date, Parent and the
Company shall confer and mutually determine, in good faith, after consulting
with their respective outside legal counsel, whether the Merger remains
eligible to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL. Unless Parent
and the Company determine that the Merger is ineligible to be effected
pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL (the "251(h) Inapplicable
Determination") the Merger shall be effected in accordance with Section
251(h) of the DGCL. If prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company
make a 251(h) Inapplicable Determination then, contingent and effective upon
the occurrence of the 251(h) Inapplicable Determination and the Acceptance
Date, the Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "Top-
Up Option") exercisable only in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth in this Section 2.3, to purchase up to that number of Company Shares
(the "Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the lowest number of Company Shares
that, when added to the number of Company Shares collectively owned by Parent
or Purchaser at the time of exercise, shall constitute one Company Share more
than 90% of the sum of (i) the then outstanding Company Shares plus (ii) a
number equal to the number of Shares issuable upon the conversion of any
convertible securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or
rights including the Company RSUs, Company Stock Options and Company Shares to
be issued pursuant to the ESPP, in each case, which are convertible or
exercisable prior to the date that is ten (10) business days after such
exercise and the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, at a purchase price per
Top-Up Option Share equal to the Per Share Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3(a), the Top-Up Option shall not
be exercisable for Company Shares in excess of the number of Company Shares
authorized and unissued or held in the treasury of the Company (giving effect
to the Company Shares issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding Company Stock
Options, RSUs and any other rights to acquire Company Shares as if such
shares were outstanding).

(b) The Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such
exercise and the issuance of Company Shares pursuant thereto, after accounting
for the

 



-17-  limitations set forth herein, Parent and Purchaser would hold one Company
Share more than 90% of the then outstanding Company Shares. The Top-Up Option
shall be exercisable (in whole and not in part) on one or more occasions at
any time after the 251(h) Inapplicable Determination and the Acceptance Date
and prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of
this Agreement.

 

(c) If Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall send to
the Company a written notice (a "Top-Up Exercise Notice") specifying the
place for the closing of the purchase the Top-Up Option Shares (the "Top-Up
Closing") and a date for the Top-Up Closing. Such notice shall also include an
undertaking signed by Parent and Purchaser that, as promptly as practicable
following such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to as promptly as practicable after such exercise,
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms hereof. The Company shall,
promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice
to Purchaser confirming (i) the number of Company Shares then outstanding and
then outstanding on a fully diluted basis, and (ii) the number of Top-Up
Option Shares issuable under the Top-Up Option and the aggregate purchase
price therefor. In addition, upon Purchasers request, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to
Purchaser the number of Company Shares issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect
to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares.

 

(d) At the Top-Up Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate or
certificates evidencing the applicable number of Top-Up Option Shares and (ii)
Purchaser shall purchase each Top-Up Option Share from the Company at the Per
Share Amount. Payment of the purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares may
be made, at Purchasers option, by delivery of (A) immediately available funds
by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company or (B) a promissory
note, or any combination thereof. Any such promissory note shall
bear interest at the applicable federal rate as determined for U.S. income
tax purposes, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution
and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid at any time without
premium or penalty. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance
of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable
legal requirements, including all federal securities laws.

 

(e) Upon the delivery by Purchaser to the Company of the Top-Up Exercise
Notice and the tender of the consideration described in Section 2.3(d),
Purchaser shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be deemed to be
the holder of record of the Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon that exercise,
notwithstanding that certificates representing those Top-Up Option
Shares shall not then be actually delivered to Purchaser or the Company shall
have failed or refused to designate the account described in Section 2.3(d).

 

(f) Certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares delivered hereunder may
include legends legally required by applicable securities laws. Parent and
Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that Purchaser may acquire
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities
Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for
transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent and Purchaser
hereby represents and warrants to the Company that it is, or will be upon the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.

 



-18- ---|---|--- 

3.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
Article 8, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time Purchaser
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation"). Such merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL
unless there shall have occurred a 251(h) Inapplicable Determination.

 

3.2 Effective Time; Closing. Upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the closing of the Merger (the "Merger Closing") will take place (a) at the
offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, 2765 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, California,
as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Date (or the Top-Up Closing if
the Top-Up Option has been exercised); provided that, if there shall be a
251(h) Inapplicable Determination and it shall be determined under applicable
Law that the Required Stockholder Vote shall be required in order to
consummate the Merger, then on the second business day after satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
8 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Merger Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted
by Law) waiver of those conditions) or (b) at such other time, date or place
is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the
Merger Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Merger Closing
Date." Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, a certificate of
merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL (the "Certificate of
Merger") shall be duly executed by the Company and simultaneously with the
Closing shall be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware (the date and time of such filing, or such later time
as shall be agreed by Parent and the Company and specified in such filing,
being the "Effective Time").

 

3.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

3.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated to conform to the Certificate of
Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of
Incorporation; _provided_ , that such Certificate of Incorporation shall
contain such provisions as are necessary to give full effect to

 



-19-  the exculpation and indemnification provided for in Section 7.7 hereof and
Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Symmetricom, Inc."

(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at the
Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Purchaser as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

3.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and, except as
determined by Parent or Purchaser prior to the Effective Time, the officers
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

3.6 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holders
of any of the following securities:

(a) Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 3.6(b) and any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and shall
be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Per Share Amount (the "Merger Consideration")
payable to the holder of such Company Share, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 3.9. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the
extent appropriate (taking into account any prior adjustments pursuant to
Section 2.1(g)) for all purposes of this Article 3\.

(b) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Company
Share owned by Purchaser, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof, and no payment
or distribution shall be made and no consideration of any kind shall be
delivered with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

3.7 Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; Restricted Stock; ESPP.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company Stock
Options,

 



-20-  each Company Stock Option outstanding that is unvested (after giving effect
to any accelerated vesting provisions in effect on the date hereof and set
forth in a Disclosed Employee Arrangement or pursuant to Section 3.7(g)) at
the Effective Time and that is not an Out-of-the-Money Option (an "Unvested
Option") will be assumed by Parent. Each Unvested Option assumed by Parent
will continue to have, and be subject to the same terms and conditions of
such option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting
restrictions, except for administrative changes that are not adverse to the
holder of the Unvested Option or to which the holder consents and except that
(i) each Unvested Option will be exercisable for a number of shares of common
stock of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") equal to the product of the number
of Company shares that would be issuable upon exercise of the Unvested Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by a quotient
obtained by dividing (A) the Merger Consideration by (B) the average closing
price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC for the five
trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective Time (the
"Exchange Ratio"), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Unvested Option will be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per share exercise price for
such Unvested Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, and (iii) all
references to the "Company" in the applicable Company Stock Plans and the
stock option agreements will be references to Parent. It is the intention of
the parties that each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent shall qualify
following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code
and to the extent such Company Stock Option qualified as an incentive stock
option prior to the Effective Time.

(b) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company Stock Options, each Company
Stock Option (or any portion thereof) outstanding that is vested (including
after giving effect to any accelerated vesting provisions in effect on
the date hereof and set forth in a Disclosed Employee Arrangement or pursuant
to Section 3.7(g)) at the Effective Time and that is not an Out-of-the-Money
Option (a "Vested Option") shall in each case be cancelled at the
Effective Time. Each Vested Option shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, an amount
in cash determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such option by (y) the
number of Company Shares subject to such Vested Option, less all applicable
deductions and withholdings required by law to be withheld in respect of such
payment. Payments of the Merger Consideration for Vested Options to employees
and former employees of the Company shall be remitted through the payroll
system of the Company or Parent. Payments of the Merger Consideration for
Vested Options to non-employees shall be remitted through the Companys or
Parents accounts payable or (with the consent of the Paying Agent) through
the Paying Agent.

(c) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company Stock Options, the vesting
and exercisability of each Company Stock Option (or any portion thereof)
outstanding at the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) that has an
exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration (an
"Out-of-the-Money Option") shall accelerate in full, and each such Out-of-the-
Money Option shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration.

 



-21- (d) Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Purchaser or the holders of
Company RSUs, each outstanding Company RSU that is then outstanding and
unvested (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting provisions in effect
on the date hereof and set forth in a Disclosed Employee Arrangement or
pursuant to Section 3.7(g)) (an "Unvested RSU") will be assumed by Parent.
Each Unvested RSU assumed by Parent will continue to have and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions of such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including the vesting restrictions, except for administrative
changes that are not adverse to the holder of the Unvested RSU or to which the
holder consents and except that (i) each Company RSU shall cover a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company
Shares that would be issuable under the Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Company Stock and (ii) all references to the
"Company" in the applicable Company Stock Plans and restricted stock unit
agreements will be references to Parent.

 

(e) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company RSUs, each Company RSU (or
any portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that is then vested (including after giving effect to any accelerated
vesting provisions or pursuant to Section 3.7(g)) (a "Vested RSU") shall in
each case be cancelled at the Effective Time. Each holder of a Vested RSU
shall be eligible to receive as soon as practicable after the Effective Time
(or, to the extent required in order to avoid the holder becoming subject to
any tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the Code, the earliest
payment date provided for in the terms and conditions of the Vested RSU) an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to (A) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
each Vested RSU, less all applicable deductions and withholdings required by
Law to be withheld in respect of such payment. If the payment for any Vested
RSU cannot be made as soon as practicable after the Effective Time without
triggering any tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the Code, the
Company shall provide prior to the Effective Time the Parent with a written
schedule specifically identifying the applicable payment date for each such
Vested RSU that complies with the payment rules under Section 409A of the
Code. Payments of the Merger Consideration for Vested RSUs to employees and
former employees of the Company shall be remitted through the payroll system
of the Company or Parent. Payments of the Merger Consideration for Vested RSUs
to non-employees shall be remitted through the Companys or Parents accounts
payable or (with the consent of the Paying Agent) through the Paying Agent.

(f) The vesting of each share of Company Restricted Stock held by a non-
employee director or consultant of the Company or any employee or other
service provider of the Company who is not a Continuing Employee or Continuing
Service Provider shall be fully accelerated at the Effective Time (and all
restrictions thereupon shall lapse) and shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in the Merger as provided in Section 3.6(a). With respect
to each outstanding share of Company Restricted Stock held by a Continuing
Employee or Continuing Service Provider, such shares shall be cancelled at
the Effective Time and the holder of such outstanding Company Restricted
Stock award shall be entitled to receive, upon or within

 



-22-  thirty (30) days following the date on which any shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such award would have vested following the Effective Time in
accordance with the provisions of the award agreement that evidences such
Company Restricted Stock (each such date, a "Vesting Date"), a cash payment
(subject to all applicable withholding) equal to the product of (x) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the portion of such Company
Restricted Stock award that would have vested on such Vesting Date multiplied
by (y) the Merger Consideration, subject to such holder continuing to provide
services to the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Parents
Subsidiaries through each such Vesting Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event the employment of any such Continuing Employee or Continuing Service
Provider with the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or an affiliate
of Parent, as the case may be, shall be terminated by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or an affiliate of Parent, as the case may be,
without Cause, or such Continuing Employee or Continuing Service Provider
resigns for Good Reason, prior to the one-year anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Vesting Date of each such share of Company Restricted Stock held by
such Continuing Employee or Continuing Service Provider shall be fully
accelerated at such time of termination and such Continuing Employee or
Continuing Service Provider shall be entitled to receive a cash payment,
within thirty (30) days following the date of termination, equal to the
aggregate amount of Merger Consideration remaining to be paid at such time in
respect of the shares of Company Restricted Stock in accordance with the
foregoing. Payments of the Merger Consideration for Company Restricted Stock
to employees and former employees of the Company shall be remitted through
the payroll system of the Company or Parent. Payments of the Merger
Consideration for Company Restricted Stock to non-employees shall be remitted
through the Companys or Parents accounts payable or (with the consent
of the Paying Agent) through the Paying Agent.

(g) The vesting and, if applicable, exercisability of each outstanding Company
Stock Option and Company RSU held by a non-employee director or consultant of
the Company or any employee or other service provider of the Company who is
not a Continuing Employee or Continuing Service Provider, shall accelerate in
full, and such Company Stock Options and Company RSUs shall be canceled at
the Effective Time (with no consideration payable in connection with such
cancellation except to the extent provided in Sections 3.7(b) and 3.7(e) after
giving effect to any acceleration provided by this Section 3.7(g)) to the
extent that the Company Stock Option and Company RSU is vested (including by
way of the foregoing acceleration) and, if applicable, not exercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time. In no event shall the Company Stock
Options or the Company RSUs described in this Section 3.7(g) be assumed by
Parent.

(h) The rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any offering
period underway immediately prior to the Effective Time under the ESPP shall
be determined by treating the last business day prior to the Effective Time
(the "Designated Date") as the last day of such offering period and by making
such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
ESPP. After the date of this Agreement, no new participants shall be permitted
to enroll in the ESPP, no participant may increase the rate of his or her
participation in the ESPP from the level in effect on the date of this
Agreement, and no new offering or purchase period shall commence under the
ESPP. The actions described in this Section 3.7(h) will be conditioned upon
the consummation of the

 



-23-  Effective Time. On the Designated Date, the funds credited as of such date
under the ESPP within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account
for each participant under the ESPP will be used to purchase shares in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP, and each share purchased thereunder
will be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.6(a), subject to withholding
of applicable income and employment withholding Taxes.

(i) Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall provide notice (in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of an outstanding award
granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, as well as each participant in the
ESPP, describing the treatment of such award in accordance with this Section
3.7. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause there to be
taken, as the case may be) such actions, shall obtain such consents, adopt (or
cause there to be adopted) any amendments of any Company Stock Plan and
any awards thereunder, and adopt (or cause there to be adopted) any
amendments of the ESPP and any purchase rights thereunder, as may be necessary
to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.7.

 

(j) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (to the extent available) with respect to the Parent Common Stock
subject to such Unvested Options and Unvested RSUs and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective
as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ten (10)
business days, following the Effective Time. It is intended that the
assumption of the Unvested Options assumed by Parent shall comply with
Sections 409A and 424 of the Code and this Section 3.7 shall be construed
consistent with such intent.

 

3.8 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by the stockholders of the Company who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, "Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by the
stockholders of the Company who shall have failed to perfect or who shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer
be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in Section 3.9.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting 

 



-24-  Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment, in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

 

3.9 Surrender of Company Shares; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of funds
to which holders of Company Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section
3.6(a). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate amount payable
pursuant to Section 3.6(a). In the event the amounts deposited with the Paying
Agent shall be insufficient to make all such Payments, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in
an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of funds required to
make such payments. The Paying Agent shall make payment of the funds to
holders of Company Shares in accordance with this Section 3.9. Such
funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or (after
the Effective Time) the Surviving Corporation, and any and all interest earned
on the funds shall be paid by the Paying Agent to Parent or (after the
Effective Time) the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall
bear and pay all charges and expenses, including those of Paying Agent,
incurred in connection with the payment of funds to holders of Company Shares.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Company Shares entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.6(a) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates evidencing such Company Shares (the "Certificates")
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Company Share formerly evidenced by
such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest
shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such taxes either
have been paid or are not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with this Agreement upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Company Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificates.

 



-25- (c) At any time following the ninth month after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Company Shares (including all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation and Parent (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and
other similar laws) with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Company Share for any Merger Consideration properly
delivered in respect of such Company Share to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

 

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable law.

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity against claims that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

3.10 Withholding Rights. Each of Purchaser, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Article 2 or 3 of this Agreement
to any holder of Company Shares, Company RSUs and Company Stock Options such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code") and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld, and paid over to the appropriate Government
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

3.11 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company or (ii) otherwise carry out the provisions
of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors shall be
deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of
attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in
law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving

 



-26-  Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the
name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action.

applicable, approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted and

Company Restricted Stock grant and each Company RSU was granted in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and all other applicable

-29-  intended to qualify as an incentive and the per share exercise price of each

4.4 Authority Relative to this Agreement.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject in
the case of the Merger to obtaining the Required Stockholder Vote, if required
under the DGCL, to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the Required
Stockholder Vote, if and to the extent required by the DGCL, and the filing of
appropriate certificate of merger as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally, and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought.

 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held on October 21, 2013,
at which all of the directors of the Company were present, unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,

are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of the Company and holders
of Company Shares, (ii) based on written representations and warranties made
by Parent and Purchaser, determined that neither Parent nor Purchaser is an
"interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203(c) of the DGCL; (iii)
adopted this Agreement and the Transactions (such adoption having been made in
accordance with the DGCL), and (iv) recommended that the holders of Company
Shares accept the Offer and tender Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, and
to the extent required by applicable Law, approve this Agreement and the
Transactions.

 



-30- 4.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict with

organizational documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
subject to obtaining the Company Required Approvals and, in the case of
the Merger, the Required Stockholder Vote, if required, conflict with or
violate any U.S. or non-U.S. law (statutory, common or otherwise), including
any statute, ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive order, injunction,
judgment, decree or other order of a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction ("Law") applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound
or affected, or (iii) subject to obtaining the consents that are required to
be listed in Section 4.5(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, result in any breach
of or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default or breach) under, or (except with respect to
Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and the ESPP in connection with the
treatment of such awards under Section 3.7 of this Agreement) give to others
any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, or result in the loss of a material
benefit under any Company Material Contract or material Permit to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any property or asset of any of them is bound or
affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (x)
prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger or (y) have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, except (i) for (w)
the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC, (x) applicable requirements,
if any, of the Exchange Act and state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky

DGCL (collectively, the "Company Required Approvals"), and (ii) where the
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or materially delay beyond the
Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.6 Permits; Compliance. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is
in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, certifications,
approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction,
including with respect to any Environmental Laws, necessary for each of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its
properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the
"Permits"), except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, any of the Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a

 



-31-  Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, and there have
occurred no defaults under, violations of, or events giving rise to a right
of termination, amendment or cancellation of any such Permits (with or without
notice, the lapse of time or both), except where the failure to have, or the
suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or delay beyond the
Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is,
and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary since October 1, 2008 has
been, in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (i) any Law or
Military Specification applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or

bound or affected, or (ii) any Company Material Contract or material Permit to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any property or asset of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is bound, except for any such conflicts, defaults,
breaches or violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received any
written notice from any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
alleging that it is not in compliance in all material respects with any Law or
Military Specification.

of the Agreement will comply, as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX") and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and (y) did not, at the time it was filed (or, if amended prior to
the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment), contain, or if filed
after the date hereof at the time of the filing will not contain, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
Company Subsidiary has been or is required to file any form, report or other
document with the SEC.

 

(b) (i) Each of the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the
SEC Reports (collectively, the "Audited Company Financial Statements") (A)
have been, or will be, as the case may be, prepared from and in accordance
with and accurately reflect the books and records of the Company and its
consolidated Company Subsidiaries in all material respects, (B) complied, or
will comply, as the case may be, as of their respective dates of filing with
the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (C) was, or
will be, as the case may be, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes 

 



-32-  thereto), and (D) fairly presents, or will fairly present, as the case may
be, in all material respects the consolidated financial position, results of

Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements, to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments). (ii) The unaudited financial
information contained in the SEC Reports (such unaudited financial information
together with the Audited Company Financial Statements, the "Company Financial
Reports") (A) has been prepared from and in accordance with and accurately
reflect the books and records of the Company and its consolidated Company
Subsidiaries in all material respects, (B) was prepared in accordance with

all material respects the consolidated financial position and results of
operations of the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments).

 

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at June 30, 2013,
including the notes thereto (the "2013 Balance Sheet"), neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of a nature
required by GAAP to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company, except for (x) liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since the date of the 2013
Balance Sheet that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to

under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the SEC Reports,
and the statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. For
purposes of this Section 4.7(d), "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX. The Company is in
compliance in all material respects with SOX.

Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)),
where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Companys or such Company Subsidiarys published financial statements or other
of the SEC Reports.

 



-33- (f) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting and accounting designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes, including to provide reasonable assurance
that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general
or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets that could have a
material effect on the Companys financial statements is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

(g) The Company has in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to
ensure that material information that is required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and made known to its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(h) The Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with
the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2013, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. The
Company has disclosed to the Companys outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Company (and made copies of such disclosures available to
Parent) (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting, and (C) any written
claim or allegation of any of the foregoing. The Company has not received
from its independent auditors any oral or written notification of a (i)
"reportable condition" or (ii) "material weakness" in the Companys
internal controls. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "reportable
condition" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them in
the Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on the date hereof.

 

(i) The Company has furnished or made available to Parent copies of all
comment letters received by the Company from the SEC since October 1, 2008,
relating to the Companys SEC Reports and all responses of the Company
thereto. There are no outstanding unresolved issues with respect to the
Company or the SEC Reports noted in comment letters or other
correspondence received by the Company or its attorneys from the SEC, and
there are no pending (i) formal or, to the knowledge of the Company, informal

4.10 Employee Benefit Plans. 

(a) Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Plans. The "Plans"
shall mean: (i) all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee

 



-35-  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other material benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all
employment, termination or severance Contracts to which the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate is a party (except for offer letters that provide for
employment that is terminable at will and without material cost or liability
to the Company or its Subsidiaries), with respect to which the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate has or could have any material obligation or that
are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, (ii) each employee benefit
plan for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could incur liability
under Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or were to be
terminated, (iii) any plan in respect of which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4212(c) of ERISA, and (iv) any
material consulting contracts, arrangements or understandings between the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and any natural person consultant of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (all Plans, excluding Plans not subject to
U.S. Law, the "US Plans"). The Company has made available to Purchaser a true
and complete copy of each Plan and has made available to Purchaser a true and
complete copy of each material document, if any, prepared in connection with
each such Plan (except for individual written Company Stock Option, Company
Restricted Stock and Company RSU agreements, in which case only forms of such
agreements have been made available, unless such individual agreements
materially differ from such forms), including as applicable (i) a copy of each
trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each most recent summary plan
description and summary of material modifications, (iii) annual reports on
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 5500 for the most recent three (3) plan
years, (iv) the most recently received IRS determination letter for each such
Plan, and (v) the most recently prepared actuarial report and financial
statement in connection with each such Plan. There are no oral Plans. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any express or implied commitment
(i) to create, incur liability with respect to or cause to exist any
other material employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, (ii) to enter
into any Contract to provide compensation or benefits to any individual other
than in the ordinary course of business, or (iii) to modify, change or
terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or
termination required by ERISA, the Code or other applicable law.

(b) None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan"), a "multiple employer
plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code) (a
"Multiple Employer Plan"), a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within
the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA) or, except as set forth on Section
4.10(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, a plan that is subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.

(c) None of the Plans (i) provides for the payment of separation, severance,
termination or similar-type benefits to any person, (ii) obligates the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to pay separation, severance, termination or
similar-type benefits solely or partially as a result of any Transaction,
or (iii) obligates the Company or any Company Subsidiary to make any payment
or provide any benefit in connection with a "change in ownership or effective
control", within the meaning of such term under Section 280G of the Code,
or in connection with an event directly or indirectly related to such a
change. None of the

 



-36-  Plans provides for or promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance
benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code,
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or similar applicable state law. There is no
contract, plan or arrangement covering any current or former director,
employee, or consultant of the Company that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to any payment or benefit as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as provided in this Agreement, the
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or together with any other event which,
standing alone, would not by itself trigger such entitlement or acceleration)
will not (i) entitle any Person to any payment, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, or increase in benefits under or with respect to any
Plan, (ii) otherwise trigger any acceleration (of vesting or payment of
benefits or otherwise) under or with respect to any Plan, or (iii) trigger any
obligation to fund any Plan. No current or former director, employee, or
consultant of the Company is entitled to receive a gross-up payment from the
Company with respect to any taxes that may be imposed upon such individual
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, Section 4999 of the Code, or otherwise.
The contracts, plans and arrangements disclosed in Section 4.10(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule are referred to herein as the "Disclosed Employee
Arrangements."

 

(d) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including ERISA and the Code. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
performed all material obligations required to be performed by them under and
are not in material default under or in material violation of, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, there is no material default or material
violation by any party to, any Plan. No Action is pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan (other than routine claims
for benefits in the ordinary course of business) and to the knowledge of the
Company, no fact or event exists that is reasonably likely to give rise to any
such Action.

 

(e) Each US Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has timely received a favorable determination, notification or advisory
letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions applicable to the US Plan
for which such letters are currently available that the US Plan is so
qualified, has a remaining period of time under applicable
Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter
and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination, or
may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype plan, and each trust
established in connection with any US Plan that is intended to be exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, has a remaining period
of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which
to apply for such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination, or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype
plan. No Company capital stock is used as a funding vehicle or otherwise
permitted as an investment option with respect to any US Plan that is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

 

(f) There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA) with respect to any US Plan. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under, arising out of or by
operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than 

 



-37-  liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising
in the ordinary course), including any liability in connection with (i) the
termination or reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA, or (ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists
that could give rise to any such liability. There are no audits, inquiries or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the
IRS, the United States Department of Labor, or other Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction with respect to any Plan.

 

(g) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any US Plan have been made on or before their due dates, except as would
not result in material liability to the Company or its subsidiaries. All such
contributions are or were fully deductible for federal income tax purposes in
all material respects and no such deduction has been challenged or
disallowed by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists that could be expected
to give rise to any such challenge or disallowance, in each case, except as
would not result in material liability to the Company or its subsidiaries.

(h) With respect to each Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(1) of the
Code), to the knowledge of the Company, (1) such plan has been operated since
January 1, 2005 in compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable
IRS guidance promulgated thereunder to the extent such plan is subject to
Section 409A of the Code and so as to avoid any tax, interest or penalty
thereunder; (2) the document or documents that evidence each such plan have
conformed to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the final
regulations under Section 409A of the Code since December 31, 2008; and (3) as
to any such plan in existence prior to January 1, 2005 and not subject to
Section 409A of the Code, has not been "materially modified" (within the
meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time after October 3, 2004.

 

(i) The parties acknowledge that certain payments have been made or are to be
made and certain benefits have been granted or are to be granted according to
employment compensation, severance and other employee benefit plans of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries or pursuant to other arrangements with
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including the Plans, to holders
of Company Common Stock and other securities of the Company (the "Covered
Securityholders") (with all such plans and arrangements being collectively
referred to as the "Company Arrangements"). All such amounts payable under
the Company Arrangements (i) have been or are being paid or granted as
compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or
future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered
Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) were not, and are
not, calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into
the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. The adoption, approval,
amendment or modification of each Company Arrangement has been approved as an
employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement
solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto and the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d10(d)(2) is
otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the execution
of this Agreement of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board

 



-38-  (the "Company Compensation Committee") or its independent directors. A true
and complete copy of any resolutions of any committee of the Company Board
reflecting any approvals and actions referred to in the preceding sentence
and taken prior to the date of this Agreement has been made available to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement.

 

(j) Except as would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Plan that
is not a U.S. Plan (the "Foreign Plans"): (A) such Foreign Plan complies with
all applicable Laws; (B) if a Foreign Plan is intended to qualify for special
Tax treatment, to the Knowledge of the Company, such plan meets all
requirements for such treatment; (C) if required under applicable Laws to be
funded and/or book-reserved, such Foreign Plan is funded and/or book reserved,
as appropriate, to the extent so required by applicable Laws, and (D) there
are no going-concern unfunded actuarial liabilities, past service unfunded
liabilities, solvency deficiencies or contribution holidays with respect to
any of the Foreign Plans.

inquiry is in progress. The employment of those employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries hired and based in the U.S. is terminable at will

material respect, of any term of any employment agreement, nondisclosure
agreement, common law nondisclosure obligation, fiduciary duty, non-

any, nor the information statement to be sent to such stockholders, as
appropriate (such proxy statement or information statement, as amended or
supplemented, being referred to herein as the "Proxy Statement"), shall, at
the date the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is
first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in

sold or disposed of since that date in the ordinary course of business and
sales after the date of the 2013 Balance Sheet of assets no longer required
for the conduct of the Business as presently conducted) in all material
respects, free of any Liens other than Permitted Title Exceptions; _provided_
, that no representation is made under this Section 4.13 with respect to
Intellectual Property Rights. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have

individually or in the aggregate, would not have, or be reasonably expected
to have, a Material

 



-41-  Adverse Effect. All of the machinery, equipment and other tangible personal
property and assets owned or used by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
are in the condition and repair sufficient to conduct their respective

Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Section 4.13(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all real property owned by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries ("Company Owned Real Property"). The Company and/or the Company

has received written notice of any condemnation, expropriation or other
proceeding in eminent domain affecting the Company Owned Real Property or any
portion thereof or interest therein, and to the knowledge of the Company, no
such proceedings are threatened or proposed. To the knowledge of the Company,
the Company Owned Real Property is not subject to any special assessment nor
any zoning or other land-use regulation proceeding, nor any change in any Law
or Permit that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or that
seeks to impose any material legal restraint on or prohibition against or
limit the Surviving Corporations ability to operate the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries substantially as it was operated prior to
the date of this Agreement with respect to the Company Owned Real Property.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has leased or otherwise granted
to any other person any rights to use, occupy or possess any part of the
Company Owned Real Property. There are no outstanding options or other
contractual rights to purchase, lease or use, or rights of first refusal to

effect and have not been modified or amended, and there exists no default
under any such lease by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor any event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
thereunder by the Company or any

materially delay beyond the Outside Date consummation of the Offer or the

Property that are required to be removed (or of which any landlord or
sublandlord could require removal) at the termination of the applicable lease
term. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received written
notice of any condemnation, expropriation or other proceeding in eminent
domain affecting the Company Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or
interest therein, and to the knowledge of the Company, no such proceedings are
threatened or proposed. To the knowledge of the Company, the Company Leased
Real Property is not subject to any special assessment nor zoning or other
land-use regulation proceeding, nor any change in any Law or Permit that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside
Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or that seeks to impose any

Corporations ability to operate the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries substantially as it was operated prior to the date of this

or unauthorized disclosure of any material Trade Secret included in the Owned
Company Intellectual Property. The Company and Company Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with and have not breached in any material
respect any contractual obligations to protect the Trade Secrets of Third
Parties in accordance with the terms of any Contracts relating to such Third
Party Trade Secrets.

(g) _Employees, Consultants, and Contractors_. Since October 1, 2008, the
Company and Company Subsidiaries have had and enforced policies requiring
each employee, consultant and contractor who is involved in the development of
any Company Products to execute proprietary information, confidentiality and
assignment agreements that, to extent permitted by applicable Law, assign to
the Company and/or a Company Subsidiary all Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights that are developed by the employees in the course
of their employment, and, with respect to consultants or contractors,
all Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights that are developed
by the consultants or contractors in the course of performing services for the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries (each, an "Employee IP Agreement").
Since October 1, 2008, each person who is or was during such time an
employee, officer, consultant and contractor of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary who are or were involved in the development of any Company Products
has signed an Employee IP Agreement, in a form substantially similar to, or
with provisions with substantially similar legal effect as the provisions of,
one of the forms made available to Parent with respect to proprietary
information, confidentiality, and assignment and licensing of Intellectual
Property and Intellectual Property Rights. Since October 1, 2008, to the
knowledge of the Company, no person who is or was an employee, officer,
consultant or contractor of the Company or any 

 



-44-  Company Subsidiary involved in the development of any Company Products is in
default or breach of any term of any Employee IP Agreement, non-disclosure
agreement, assignment agreement, or similar Contract relating to Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Rights entered into between such employee,
officer, consultant or contractor and the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with such individuals employment or other engagement with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. All assignments of registered Patents
included in the Registered Company Intellectual Property to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary have been duly executed and recorded with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities. Since October 1, 2008, no person who is
or was during such time an employee, officer, consultant or contractor of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has any ownership, license or other right,
title or interest, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any
material Owned Company Intellectual Property (other than to the extent any
such individual has a non-exclusive license to use Company Products in the
ordinary course of business). Since October 1, 2008, no material Intellectual
Property or material Intellectual Property Rights excluded or carved-out from
any employee assignment contained in any Employee IP Agreement that is related
to any Company Product or to any other aspect of the business of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the "Employee Retained IP") is
included in (or claimed or purported to be included in) any material
Intellectual Property or material Intellectual Property Rights included in
any Company Products (other than Employee Retained IP that is generally
available to the public under Open Source license terms or which is licensed
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary).

 

(h) _Enforceability, Validity of IP_. To the knowledge of the Company, there
are no facts or circumstances that would be reasonably expected to render
invalid or unenforceable any of the Intellectual Property Rights included in
the Owned Company Intellectual Property (or provide any reasonable grounds
therefor). To the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts
or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect,
limit, restrict, impair, or impede the ability of Surviving Corporation and
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to use and practice the Owned Company
Intellectual Property from and after the Effective Time in substantially the
same manner in which it was used prior to the Effective Time. Since October 1,
2008, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
notice of any Action challenging the validity or enforceability of any of the
Registered Company Intellectual Property or the Owned Copyrights, or
containing any threat on the part of any person to bring an Action that any of
the Registered Company Intellectual Property or the Owned Copyrights is
invalid, is unenforceable or has been misused, other than any Action finally
resolved prior to October 1, 2011.

 

(i) _No Infringement or Misappropriation of Company IP_. To the knowledge of
the Company, no Third Party is infringing, misappropriating, or using or
disclosing without authorization any Intellectual Property Rights owned or
exclusively licensed by Company or any Company Subsidiary. Since October 1,
2008, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has commenced any Action
with respect to infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property
Rights owned by or exclusively licensed to Company or any Company Subsidiary
against any Third Party. Since October 1, 2008, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice of any Action
challenging the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys exclusive ownership of
any Intellectual Property Rights included in the Owned Company Intellectual
Property or claiming that any other person has any claim of legal or
beneficial ownership with respect thereto (other than any Action finally
resolved prior to October 1, 2011).

 



-45- (j) _Infringement by Company_. Since October 1, 2008, Company and its
Subsidiaries have not received any written notice of any Action alleging that
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has infringed, misappropriated, used or
disclosed without authorization or otherwise violated any Intellectual
Property Rights of any person, or that any Company Product infringes,
misappropriates, uses or discloses without authorization, or otherwise
violates any Intellectual Property Rights of any person and, to the knowledge
of Company, there are no facts, circumstances or information that would be
the basis for such Action (other than any Action finally resolved prior to
October 1, 2011). Since October 1, 2008, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any written communication inviting the Company or its
Subsidiaries to take a license, covenant not to sue, or the like with respect
to a Third Persons Intellectual Property Rights, other than in connection
with licenses or covenants not to sue granted to Company or the Company
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and not related to any
infringement or other violation by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(other than any Action finally resolved prior to October 1, 2011).

 

(k) _Ownership; Licenses_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own the
Owned Company Intellectual Property, except for any moral rights of any Third
Party existing therein, free and clear of all Liens (except for non-exclusive
licenses granted in the ordinary course of business), and have not exclusively
licensed (under any Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement) any
such Owned Company Intellectual Property to any Third Party, and are under no
obligation under any Contract in effect as of the date hereof to grant any
such licenses.

 

(l) _Scheduled IP Agreements_. Section 4.14(l) of the Disclosure Schedule
contains a complete and accurate list of:

 

(i) all material Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party, or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is otherwise bound
as of the date hereof, under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
granted or agreed to grant to any Third Party any license, covenant, release,
immunity, assignment, or other right with respect to any Owned
Company Intellectual Property, other than any licenses or other rights with
respect to any Trade Secrets granted under any nondisclosure agreement or any
non-exclusive licenses or rights with respect to any Company Intellectual
Property granted under any independent contractor services agreement, and any
non-exclusive licenses to use the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
Trademarks for limited publicity purposes or in connection with such Third
Partys performance under a broker, distributor, dealer, manufacturers
representative, franchise, agency, sales promotion, market research,
marketing, consulting, or advertising agreement; and

 

(ii) all material Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party, or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is otherwise bound
as of the date hereof, under which any Third Party has granted or agreed to
grant to Company or any Company Subsidiary any license, covenant, release,
immunity, assignment, or other right with respect to any Company
Intellectual Property (other than

 



-46-  generally available commercial Software that is licensed on standard or non-
negotiable terms or pursuant to Open Source, "shrinkwrap" or "clickwrap"
license agreements, any licenses or other rights with respect to any Trade
Secrets granted under any nondisclosure agreement or any non-exclusive
licenses or rights with respect to any Company Intellectual Property granted
under any independent contractor services agreement, and any non-exclusive
licenses or other rights to use a Third Partys Trademarks for limited
publicity purposes or in connection with the Companys or any Company
Subsidiarys performance under a broker, distributor, dealer, manufacturers
representative, franchise, agency, sales promotion, market research,
marketing, consulting, or advertising agreement).

 

(iii) the material Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party, or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is otherwise
bound, included in subsection (i) or (ii) above are, collectively, the
"Company Intellectual Property Agreements." All Company Intellectual Property
Agreements that have not expired or terminated in accordance with their terms
are in full force and effect and are enforceable in accordance with their
terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors generally). The Company and each Company Subsidiary is in material
compliance with, and has not materially breached any term of, any such Company
Intellectual Property Agreements (other than any material breaches that the
Company or a Company Subsidiary has cured) and, to the knowledge of Company,
all other parties to such Company Intellectual Property Agreements are in
material compliance with, and have not materially breached any term of, such
Company Intellectual Property Agreements (other than any material breaches
that any other party has cured). There are no pending disputes regarding such
Company Intellectual Property Agreements, including disputes with respect to
the scope thereof, performance thereunder, or payments made or received in
connection therewith. Correct and complete copies of all Company Intellectual
Property Agreements have been made available to Parent.

 

(m) _Effect of Transaction_. Neither the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will violate or
result in the breach, material modification, cancellation, termination or
suspension of, loss of any rights or acceleration of any payments under the
Company Intellectual Property Agreements (or give rise to any right with
respect to any of the foregoing). Immediately following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will have and be permitted to exercise all of the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries rights under the Company
Intellectual Property Agreements (and will have the same rights with respect
to the Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties
under the Company Intellectual Property Agreements) to the same extent that
Company and the Company Subsidiaries would have had, and been able to
exercise, had this Agreement not been entered into, and the Transactions not
occurred, without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other
than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which Company and Company
Subsidiaries would otherwise have been required to pay anyway pursuant to the
Company Intellectual Property Agreements. No Contract to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound, will cause or require
(or purports to cause or require) the Surviving Corporation or Parent to (i)
grant to any Third Party any license, covenant not to sue, immunity or other
right with respect to or under any Intellectual Property Rights of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation; or (ii) be obligated to pay any royalties or other
amounts, or offer any discounts, to any Third Party (except, in each of (i)
and (ii), with respect to

 



-47-  Surviving Corporation only, royalties, other amounts, discounts, licenses,
covenants not to sue, immunities or other rights that Surviving Corporation
would have had to pay, offer or grant had this Agreement not been entered
into and the Transactions not been consummated).

(n) _Open Source_. No Company Product incorporates, is integrated or bundled
with, or links to any Copyleft Open Source. Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have used commercially reasonable efforts to (a) identify all
Open Source in any Company Product and (b) regulate the use and distribution
of Open Source in compliance with the applicable Open Source licenses.

(o) _Standards, SIGs_. Section 4.14(o) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a
list of all standards-setting organizations, industry bodies and consortia,
and other multi-party special interest groups in which Company or any Company
Subsidiary is currently participating, or in which Company or any Company
Subsidiary has participated since October 1, 2008, to the extent that such
past participation imposes or purports to impose any continuing obligations on
Company or any Company Subsidiary (or, following the Effective Time, on
Parent or the Surviving Corporation) with respect to licensing or granting of
any Owned Company Intellectual Property Rights (other than licenses that
survive with respect to the copyright in contributions made during such past
participation).

(p) _Company Products_. "Company Products" means all products of the Company

accordance with generally accepted industry standards to identify (and, as

make available any disabling codes or instructions, spyware, Trojan horses,
worms, viruses or other software routines intentionally designed to permit or
cause unauthorized access to, or unauthorized disruption, impairment,
disablement, or destruction of, Software, data or other materials by a Third
Party ("Contaminants").

4.15 Taxes.

 

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has filed all material
Tax Returns that it was required to file under applicable laws and
regulations. All such Tax Returns as so filed disclose all material Taxes
required to be paid for the periods covered thereby. All material Taxes due
and owing by Company or the Company Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any
Tax Return) have been paid. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes
not yet delinquent or being contested in good faith and for which reserves in
accordance with GAAP have been established on the Company Financial Reports as
adjusted in the ordinary course of business through the Effective Time) upon
any assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Except as would
not cause, or be reasonably expected to cause, a Material Adverse Effect, each
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
stockholder, or other third party and all material Forms W-2 and 1099
required with respect thereto have been properly completed and timely filed.

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries either claimed or raised by any
authority in writing which remains unpaid or unresolved.

of all federal income Tax Returns, examination reports, and statements of
deficiencies assessed against, or agreed to by the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries since January 31, 2006. Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries has waived any statutes of limitations in respect of
material Taxes which waiver remains in effect or agreed to any extension of
time with respect to a material Tax assessment or deficiency which assessment
or deficiency has not been paid. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has, at any time during the last three (3) years, received written
notice of any claim made by a Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction in
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns, that
the Company or a Company Subsidiary is or may be required to file Tax Returns
or to pay Taxes to that jurisdiction.

 

(d) The Transactions (including the Offer and Merger) will not result in the
payment or series of payments by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to any person of an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code, or any similar payment, that is not deductible
for federal, state, local or foreign Tax purposes. Additionally, there is no
contract to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
that, individually or collectively, (i) could give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) or Section
280G of the Code, or (ii) could require the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
or Parent or its subsidiaries to gross up a payment to any employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for Tax related payments or cause

for any taxable year and neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
obligation to contribute to the payment of any material Tax of any person
other than the Company or a Company Subsidiary under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as
transferee, successor.

(f) None of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" within the

corporation in the two years prior to the Effective Time) or that otherwise
constitutes part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code in conjunction with the Offer and the
Merger.

 



-49- (g) None of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or bound by
any Tax allocation, sharing or indemnity agreement (for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding indemnification provisions for Taxes contained in credit
agreements, leases or other commercial agreements the primary purposes of
which do not relate to Taxes).

 

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged in a "listed

reasonably likely to result in a material liability to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; (c) to the knowledge of the Company, neither the execution

Substances, or any notice to or consent of Governmental Authorities or Third

under Environmental Laws; (d) no Action has been brought or is pending
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, arising under or related to
any Environmental Law or related to any environmental condition, including

4.24 Systems and Information Technology.

 

(a) _Systems_. The computer, information technology and data processing
systems, facilities and services used by the Company and
Company Subsidiaries, including all hardware, networks, communications
facilities, platforms and related systems and services in the custody or
control of the Company and Company Subsidiaries (collectively, "Systems"), are
reasonably sufficient to perform all computing, information technology and
data processing operations necessary for the current operation of the Company
and Company Subsidiaries. Since October 1, 2008, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps and implemented
commercially reasonable safeguards to protect the Systems within the custody
or control of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries from Contaminants.
Except as set forth in Section 4.24 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries own and operate, or otherwise have a right or
license to use, all Systems. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will have and be permitted to exercise the same rights (whether
ownership, license or otherwise) with respect to the Systems as the Company
would have had and been able to exercise had this Agreement and such other
Contracts, documents and instruments to be executed and delivered after the
date of this Agreement not been entered into and the Transactions not
occurred, without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other
than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries would otherwise have been required to pay anyway (other than
with respect to any Systems that are generally commercially available on
reasonable terms).

 



-54- (b) _Information Technology_. Since October 1, 2008, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps to provide for

on magnetic or optical media in the ordinary course of business) in a
commercially reasonable attempt to avoid material disruption or interruption
to the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries currently have in place commercially reasonable
disaster recovery and business continuity plans and procedures.

circumstances pertaining to the Companys or any Company Subsidiaries export

-55- 4.27 Government Contracts.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries are currently in,
and the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the

Shares, Company Restricted Stock, Company Stock Options or Company RSUs to
such individuals).

4.29 Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
Company Shares (the "Required Stockholder Vote"), is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock that, absent
Section 251(h) of the DGCL, would have been necessary under applicable Law and
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to adopt, approve or authorize
this Agreement and consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby in their capacity as stockholders of the Company.

 

4.30 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Prior to the execution of this Agreement,
the Company Board received an opinion from Jefferies LLC to the effect that,
as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the various
qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Amount to be
received by holders of Common Stock (other than Parent, Purchaser and their
respective affiliates) pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, taken together,
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company will
deliver a written copy of such opinion to Purchaser solely for informational
purposes promptly following the date hereof.



     | 5. | _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Purchaser_. 
---|---|--- 

Parent and Purchaser hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
the Company that:

5.1 Corporate Organization. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and
Purchaser is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent and Purchaser
from performing any of their material obligations under this Agreement.

 



-57- 5.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Each of Parent and Purchaser has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Parent and Purchaser and the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions
(other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser,
enforceable against each of Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms,
except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter
in effect, affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) the remedy of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may
be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before
which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

 

5.3 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not,
(i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
either Parent or Purchaser, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions described in Section 5.3(b) have been
obtained and all filings and obligations described in Section 5.3(b) have been
made, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Purchaser or by
which any property or asset of either of them is bound or affected, or (iii)
result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default or breach) under, or
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset
of Parent or Purchaser pursuant to, or result in the loss of a material
benefit under any Contract, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Purchaser is a party or by which Parent or
Purchaser or any property or asset of either of them is bound or affected,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent and Purchaser from performing any of
their material obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with, or
notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for applicable
requirements, if any, of (x) the Exchange Act and Blue Sky Laws, (y) the HSR
Act and similar requirements in foreign countries where a merger filing will
be necessary or advisable and (z) the filing and recordation of appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL, and (ii) where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent
or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent
Parent or Purchaser from performing their material obligations under this
Agreement.

 



-58- 5.4 Financing. Parent has, and at each of the expiration of the Offer and at
the Effective Time, Parent shall have and shall make available or cause one
or more of its affiliates to make available to Purchaser sufficient cash and
other sources of immediately available funds to purchase and pay for all of
the Company Shares that may be tendered pursuant to the Offer or that may be
converted into the Per Share Amount in the Merger and to pay all fees and
expenses in connection therewith.

 

5.5 Absence of Litigation. Except as disclosed in Section 5.5 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule dated the date hereof and delivered by Parent to the
Company (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule"), there is no material Action
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, threatened against
Parent, any subsidiary of Parent, or any property or asset of Parent or any
subsidiary of Parent, before any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction that is reasonably likely to prevent the consummation of any
Transaction or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their
material obligations under this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any subsidiary
of Parent nor any property or asset of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent is
subject to any material continuing order of, consent decree, settlement
agreement or similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent
or Purchaser, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award of any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction that is reasonably likely to prevent consummation of the Offer or
the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their
material obligations under this Agreement.

 

5.6 Purchaser. All of the outstanding capital stock of Purchaser is owned
directly by Parent. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in
connection with its incorporation or organization or the negotiation and
consummation of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the Transactions,
Purchaser has not incurred any obligations or liabilities, and has not engaged
in any business or activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into
any Contracts or arrangements with any person or entity.

5.7 Ownership of Company Capital Stock. Neither Parent nor Purchaser is, nor
at any time during the last three (3) years has it been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203(c) of the DGCL (other
than as contemplated by this Agreement). Prior to the date hereof, neither
Parent nor Purchaser has taken, or authorized or permitted any Representatives
of Parent or Purchaser to take, any action that would reasonably be expected
to cause, Parent, Purchaser or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" to
be deemed an "interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL or
otherwise render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger. 

5.8 Vote Required. No vote of the holders of any of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement and the
Transactions.

5.9 Offer Documents; Proxy Statement; Schedule 14D-9. The Offer Documents
shall not, at the time the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC or are
first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, as the case may
be, contain any untrue

 



-59-  statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The information supplied by Parent to the Company specifically for inclusion
in the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement, if any, shall not, at the date
first mailed to stockholders of the Company, and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not false or misleading, or necessary to correct
any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for the Stockholders Meeting that shall have become false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser make no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company or any of its representatives for inclusion in any of the foregoing
documents or the Offer Documents. The information supplied by Parent for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 and Proxy Statement, if any, and the Offer
Documents shall comply in all material respects as to form with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Transactions. In addition, and not in limitation of the foregoing, except as
(x) expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (y) set forth in Section 6.1 of
the Disclosure Schedule or (z) as required in compliance with all applicable
Laws, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall, between

Companys Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, (i) duly call, give notice
of, convene and

 



-63-  hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders as promptly as
practicable following consummation of the Offer (or, if later, following the
termination of the subsequent offering period, if any) for the purpose of
considering and taking action on this Agreement and the Transactions (the
"Stockholders Meeting"), and (ii) subject to the terms of this Agreement, (A)
include in the Proxy Statement, and not subsequently withdraw or modify in
any manner adverse to Purchaser or Parent, the unanimous recommendation of the
Company Board that the stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement and

Merger.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event that the Merger cannot be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of
the DGCL, then if Parent, Purchaser and any other subsidiary of Parent, holds
in the aggregate at least ninety percent (90%) of the then issued and
outstanding Company Shares following the consummation of the Offer, then each
of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the Acceptance Time, without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.

7.2 Proxy Statement. If approval of the Companys stockholders is required by
the DGCL to consummate the Merger, then, as promptly as practicable following
consummation of the Offer (or, if later, following the termination of the
subsequent offering period, if any), the Company shall file the Proxy
Statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC. Parent, Purchaser
and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the

 



-64-  Proxy Statement, and the Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt
of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any
requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence
and summaries of all oral exchanges between the Company or any representative
of the Company and the SEC. The Company shall promptly provide Parent and its
counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy Statement, including all
amendments and supplements thereto, prior to its being filed with the SEC, and
shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review all responses
to requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to their
being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with
the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and
requests by the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement and all required
amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Company
Shares entitled to vote at the Stockholders Meeting at the earliest
practicable time.

7.3 Company Board Representation; Section 14(f).

 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, upon the Acceptance Date and
from time to time thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate up to
such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company
Board as shall give Purchaser representation on the Company Board equal to the
product of (x) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving
effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (y)
the percentage that the aggregate number of Company Shares beneficially owned
by Purchaser and any affiliate of Purchaser following such acceptance
for purchase bears to the total number of Company Shares then outstanding,
and the Company shall, at such time, promptly take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause Purchasers designees to be elected as directors of the
Company, including, at Parents election, by increasing the size of the
Company Board or seeking and accepting the resignations of incumbent
directors, or both. At such times, the Company shall cause persons designated
by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded up, if necessary) as
persons designated by Purchaser constitute of the Company Board of (i) each
committee of the Company Board, (ii) the board of directors of each Company
Subsidiary, and (iii) each committee of each such board. The provisions of
this Section 7.3 are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that
Purchaser, Parent or any affiliate of Purchaser or Parent may have (with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Law as a
holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock.

(b) The Company shall promptly take all actions required to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 7.3, including all such actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information
with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required
under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to fulfill such obligations. Parent or
Purchaser shall supply to the Company any information with respect to either
of them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the Company Board,
then until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to
have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the date of this
Agreement, including at least two (2) directors who are

 



-65-  (i) selected by such current directors and (ii) independent directors for
purposes of the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC
(such directors, the "Independent Directors"), _provided_ , that, if any
Independent Director is unable to serve due to death or disability or any
other reason, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to elect
or designate another individual (or individuals) who serve(s) as a director
(or directors) on the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ , that no such
individual is an employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) to fill
the vacancy, and such director (or directors) shall be deemed to be an
Independent Director (or Independent Directors) for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate two (2) individuals, _provided_ , that such individuals shall not
be employees, officers, directors or affiliates of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser (or, in the event that there shall be less than two (2) directors
available to fill the vacancies as a result of such individuals deaths,
disabilities or refusals to serve, such smaller number of individuals who are
directors on the date of this Agreement) to fill the vacancies and such
directors shall be deemed Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. Following the Control Date and prior to the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement by the Company, the approval of a majority of
the Independent Directors shall be required to authorize (and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no
other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other
director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any amendment or
termination of this Agreement on behalf of the Company, any extension by the
Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations of Parent or
Purchaser under this Agreement, any waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements of Parent or Purchaser or conditions contained herein for the
benefit of the Company, any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-Laws of the Company that would adversely affect the ability of the Company
to consummate any of the Transactions and any other determination with respect
to any action to be taken or not taken by or on behalf of Company or the
Company Board relating to this Agreement or the Transactions contemplated
hereby that is reasonably likely to adversely impact the holders of Company
Shares. The Independent Directors shall have the authority to retain counsel
(which may include current counsel to the Company) at the expense of the
Company for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations hereunder, and shall
have the authority, after the Acceptance Date, to institute any action on
behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms (and such authorization for such an action shall
constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the
part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize such action).

7.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) Upon reasonable prior notice, from the date hereof until the Effective
Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the
officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to, afford the officers, employees and other
Representatives of Parent and Purchaser reasonable access at all
reasonable times to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices,
plants and other facilities, books and records of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary, including the Owned Company Intellectual Property, and shall
furnish Parent and Purchaser with such financial, operating and other data
and information (including the work papers of the Companys accountants) as
Parent or Purchaser, through their officers, employees and other
Representatives, may reasonably request as long as these actions are in
compliance with all applicable data

 



-66-  privacy/protection Laws; _provided_ , that such disclosure shall not be
required to include any information that is subject to a statutory non-
disclosure or similar provision or agreement with a Governmental Authority;
prime contractor, higher-tier subcontractor, distributor, or other third party
for end-use by a Governmental Authority (collectively, "Governmental
Contracting Parties"), or that is subject to an attorney-client privilege. If
requested by Parent, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
secure the consent of the appropriate Governmental Contracting Party to permit
disclosure of such protected information to Parent and Purchaser.

(b) All information obtained by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this Section
7.4 shall be held confidential in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(c) The Company shall consult with Parent in good faith on a regular basis as
reasonably requested by Parent to report material (individually or in the
aggregate) operational developments, the status of relationships with
customers and potential customers, the status of ongoing operations and other
matters reasonably requested by Parent, including the continued accuracy of
the Companys representations and warranties and compliance with the Companys
covenants and obligations under this Agreement.

(d) The Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary in its reasonable
judgment, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided under this
Section 7.4 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or
directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the Company.

(e) No investigation or consultation pursuant to this Section 7.4 or
otherwise shall affect any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the
obligations of the parties hereto or any condition to the Offer.

7.5 Solicitation of Transactions.

 

(a) Go-Shop Period. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and
continuing until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the earlier of the
Acceptance Date or November 8, 2013 (such date and time, the "No-Shop Period
Start Date"), the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall have the right to: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage,
whether publicly or otherwise, Acquisition Proposals, including by way of
providing access to non-public information pursuant to one or
more confidentiality agreements that are on terms, with respect to the
maintenance of confidentiality of the Companys information, which are not
less restrictive in the aggregate to such person than such provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent; _provided_ , that the Company shall
promptly provide to Parent a copy of any material non-public information
concerning the Company or its subsidiaries that is provided to any Person
given such access which was not previously provided to Parent (or its
Representatives); and (ii) enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations
with respect to Acquisitions Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist
or participate in, or facilitate, any such inquiries, proposals, discussions
or negotiations or the making of any Acquisition Proposal.

 



-67- (b) No-Shop Period.

 

(i) Except as permitted by this Section 7.5 and except as may relate to any
Excluded Party, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries
and each of its and their respective Representatives to (i) on the No-Shop
Period Start Date, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
and require such Persons and any other Persons who have made or have
indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or
destroy any confidential information previously furnished by the Company, any
of its subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives; and (ii) from
the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of the Control Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they authorize or knowingly
permit any of their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Acquisition
Proposal or the making thereof to the Company or its stockholders; (ii) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish any non-public information to, or otherwise cooperate in
any way with, any person (other than Parent, Purchaser and their
Representatives) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) waive,
terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual
"standstill," confidentiality or similar obligation of any person other than
Parent or its affiliates; or (iv) take any action to render any provision of
any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business
combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute (including Section 203 of
the DCGL) or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover
provision in the Companys organizational documents, in each case inapplicable
to any person (other than Parent, Purchaser or any of their affiliates)
or any Acquisition Proposal (and to the extent permitted thereunder, the
Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that
may have been heretofore granted to any such person or Acquisition Proposal
under any such provisions). Any breach of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 7.5 by any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Companys or the Company
Subsidiaries Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach by the Company.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if at any time following
the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the Acceptance Date, in response
to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) is, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition
Proposal did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of this
Section 7.5(b) and was made after the date hereof, the Company may, subject to
compliance with Section 7.5(d), (x) furnish information regarding the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal
(and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (which shall
permit the Company to comply with the terms of this Section 7.5(b) and
Section 7.5(d)) containing confidentiality and standstill provisions not less
restrictive in the aggregate to such person than such provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent;  _provided_ , that all such
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or promptly following the time it is provided to such person, and

 



-68-  (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition
Proposal, but only if and to the extent that in connection with the foregoing
clauses (x) and (y), the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and _provided_ , the Company shall not take any of the
actions referred to in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) unless the Company
shall have notified Parent in writing at least two (2) business days prior to
taking such action that it intends to take such action and the basis hereunder
therefor; _provided_ _further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 7.5(a) or this Section 7.5(b), prior to the
Acceptance Date, the Company will in any event be permitted to take any or all
of the actions described in clauses (x) and (y) above with respect to any
Excluded Party. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the
Acceptance Date, the Company may, to the extent the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, not enforce any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party for the sole purpose of allowing the other party
to such agreement to submit an Acquisition Proposal, or with respect to
another party that has submitted an Acquisition Proposal, solely with respect
to such submission, that will constitute, or is reasonably likely to lead to,
a Superior Proposal, that did not, in each case, result from a breach by the
Company of this Section 7.5(b).

 

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, which did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of this Section 7.5, made by a Third Party that, if
consummated, would result in such Third Partys (or its stockholders) owning,
directly or indirectly, greater than 50% of the equity securities of the
Company (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or
indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole and that (i) the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
its outside legal counsel to be more favorable from a financial point of view
to the Companys stockholders than the Offer and the Merger (taking into
account all terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement,
including (1) any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such offer or otherwise, (2) whether the proposal is reasonably
capable of being completed by such Third Party (taking into account, among
other things, the expectation of obtaining required regulatory approvals) and
(3) if financing is required, whether such financing is reasonably available
to the Third Party).

(c) (i) Except as set forth in this Section 7.5, until the earlier of
the Acceptance Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
the terms hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:
(x) (A) fail to make pursuant to Section 2.2(b), or withdraw, modify, amend
or qualify or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in any
manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the
Company Board or any committee thereof of this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation"), (B) fail to recommend against
acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer other than the Offer for the
Company Common Stock within ten (10) 

 



-69-  business days of the commencement of such offer, (C) approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of
the foregoing in clauses (A)-(C), a "Change in Recommendation"), or (y) adopt
or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or recommend, or allow the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar Contract constituting or related to,
any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 7.5(a) or Section 7.5(b)) (any of the foregoing, an "Acquisition
Agreement").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time prior to the
Acceptance Date and solely in response to an Intervening Event, effect a
Change in Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may
not effect a Change in Recommendation unless the Company shall have provided
prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) business days in advance of
its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify the facts,
circumstances and other conditions giving rise thereto, and prior to effecting
such Change in Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during such four (4) business day period, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
Change in Recommendation is no longer necessary; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company Board shall not be permitted to effect a Change in
Recommendation pursuant to this Section 7.5(c)(ii) with respect to or
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal (which shall be covered by and
subject in all respects to Section 7.5(c)(iii)).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company Board may in response to
an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was made after
the date of this Agreement and did not result from or arise in connection with
a breach of this Section 7.5, (A) make a Change in Recommendation if the
Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that, in light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, that
failure to make such Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1(g) and concurrently with such termination enter into an
Acquisition Agreement if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of the receipt of
such Superior Proposal, that failure to so terminate this Agreement would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company shall not
be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause
(B), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall
be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination
the Company pays by wire transfer of immediately available funds the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.1(g); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Change
in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g), and
any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless the Company has:

(A) provided to Parent three (3) business days prior written notice that it
intends to take such action (a "Notice of Designated Superior Proposal"),
which notice shall describe the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal
that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board (a "Designated
Superior Proposal") and attach the most current form or draft of any written
agreement providing for the transaction contemplated by such Designated
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Designated Superior Proposal with a new three (3)
business day notice period), 

 



-70- (B) during each such three (3) business day period, if requested by Parent,
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that the Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute
a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal, and

 

(C) at the end of such three (3) business day period, such Acquisition
Proposal has not been withdrawn and the Company Board determines in good
faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed
by Parent in response to a Notice of Designated Superior Proposal, as a result
of the negotiations required by clause (B) or otherwise).

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within the greater of one
(1) business day or twenty-four (24) hours of learning of the relevant
information) advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of doubt any request for
information or other inquiry which the Company would reasonably expect to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal), including the material terms and conditions
of such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity
of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and attaching a copy of any
such written Acquisition Proposal, or if such Acquisition Proposal is provided
orally to the Company, the Company shall summarize in writing the terms of
such Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of doubt any such
request or other inquiry). The Company shall keep Parent informed on a prompt
basis in all material respects of the status and details (including any
material change or proposed change to the terms thereof) of any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within ten (10) business days of the commencement of any tender or exchange
offer by a Third Party, after receipt of a written request by Parent
to provide such reaffirmation, unless a Change in Recommendation is permitted
by Section 7.5(c)(iii).

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.5 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) making any disclosure to the holders of Company Shares
if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to make such disclosure would reasonably
be expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law ( _provided_ that each such disclosure shall include a
public reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation), or (ii) taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act or under Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that any

 



-71-  such disclosure, other than a "stop, look and listen" communication of the
type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, shall be deemed to
be a Change in Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such communication; and
_provided_ _further_ that this Section 7.5(e) shall not be deemed to permit
the Companys Board or any committee thereof to make a Change in
Recommendation except as expressly permitted by Section 7.5(c).

7.6 Employee Benefits Matters.

(a) If so directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the
initial scheduled expiration of the Offer, the Company Board will adopt (and
will cause any other sponsor of the applicable Plan to adopt), at least five
(5) business days prior to the initial scheduled expiration of the Offer,
resolutions terminating any and all Plans intended to qualify as a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member
of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of
the Code) as Parent. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of Parent, and the Company shall provide
Parent evidence that such resolutions have been adopted by the Company
Board or the board of directors of the Company Subsidiaries or any other
applicable Plan sponsor, as applicable. The Company shall take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may
reasonably request.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent
and/or their respective subsidiaries shall provide the Continuing Employees
with substantially comparable types and levels of employee benefits (excluding
any defined benefit pension plan and equity award, change of control and/or
severance benefits) ("Parent Plans"), as those provided to similarly-situated
employees of Parent, _provided_ that this undertaking shall not obligate
Parent to continue the employment of such Continuing Employees for any period
following the Effective Time, and such Continuing Employees may be terminated
by Parent at any time (except to the extent otherwise restricted by Law).

(c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of
benefits (but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or frozen
benefit plan of Parent or vesting under any equity incentive plan) under any
Parent Plan, Parent will credit each Continuing Employee with his or her
years of service with the Company before the Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing will not apply for purposes of
qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, Parent will, subject in each case to
receipt of any required consent of the applicable Plan provider, cause (i)
each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all Parent Plans, (ii) for purposes of each
Parent Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Plans in which 

 



-72-  such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (iii) for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, the
crediting of each Continuing Employee with any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Plan.

 

(d) Parent will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in
accordance with their terms, (i) the severance plan listed on Section 7.6(d)
of the Disclosure Schedule for a period of at least six (6) months following
the Effective Time and (ii) the executive agreements listed on Section 7.6(d)
of the Disclosure Schedule following the Effective Time.

(e) On the first payroll date in the month following the month in which the
Merger Closing Date occurs ( _provided_  that such date shall not be sooner
than the first payroll date in January 2014), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay a cash bonus to each Continuing Employee who
remains on the Companys payroll as of the Merger Closing Date and is a
participant in the Companys Incentive Compensation Plan or the Companys
Success Sharing Plan equal to a prorated portion of each such Continuing
Employees annual bonus in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, less applicable deductions and withholdings, based on performance
against target during the period elapsed from the beginning of the fiscal year
to the end of the month in which the Merger Closing Date occurs (and based, as
may be necessary, on estimated performance for the final month of that
period).

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall (x) create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or service provider or former service provider (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in any respect, including in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment), or create any such rights in any such
persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any Plan or any employee or service provider program or
arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any Plan of the
Company prior to the Effective Time), or (y) constitute or be construed to
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation or benefit plans
maintained for or provided to employees or other persons prior to or following
the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on
the rights to amend, modify or terminate any such plans or arrangements of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any Plan of the Company prior to
the Effective Time).

(g) If the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries enters into, adopts,
amends, modifies or terminates any Company Arrangement, all such amounts
payable under such Company Arrangement shall (i) be paid or granted as
compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or
future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered
Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not be
calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into the
Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. Moreover, the Company shall
take all actions necessary so that, prior to the Expiration Date: (i) the
adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each such Company Arrangement
shall be approved as an employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the Company in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and the instructions thereto 

 



-73-  and (ii) the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d10(d)(2) is
otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the Expiration
Date of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the Company Compensation
Committee or its independent directors.

7.7 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to any indemnification, exculpation or advance of expense or
similar agreement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in favor of any
present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the
Company and any Company Subsidiary (the "Indemnification Agreements") (and all
other indemnification agreements of the Company that are on terms
substantially similar to the Indemnification Agreements) and any
indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses provisions under the
Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws (or comparable organizational
documents) as in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Date; _provided_ ,
that such obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to
time under applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and for six (6) years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide officers and directors liability, fiduciary
liability and similar insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each
Indemnified Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the Companys
DandO Insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement as
well as covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person under ERISA;
_provided_ , that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.7(b),
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in the
aggregate in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its
last full fiscal year, which amount the Company has disclosed to Parent prior
to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, and prior to the Acceptance Date, the
Company may, with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), purchase a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy, covering the same persons
and providing the same terms with respect to coverage and premium amount
as aforesaid, and that by its terms shall provide coverage until the sixth
annual anniversary of the Effective Time, and upon the purchase of such
insurance Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 7.7(b) shall be deemed satisfied for so long
as such insurance is in full force and effect and covers the matters that
would otherwise be covered pursuant to Section 7.7(b).

 

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.7 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to

 



-74-  the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.

7.8 Anti-Takeover Statutes. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and Company Board
shall grant such approval and take such action as necessary so that such
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

7.9 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent and Purchaser in writing of: (i) any representation or warranty made
by the Company contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such
that the conditions set forth in clause (iii)(d) of Annex A would not be
satisfied or (x) any failure of the Company to comply with any covenant or
agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in clause (iii)(e) of Annex A would not be satisfied; and
(ii) the occurrence or existence of any Effect that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company in writing of
any representation or warranty made by Parent or Purchaser contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent or
Purchaser to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it
under this Agreement, in each case, such that the failure to so comply or the
becoming untrue or incorrect would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent
or Purchaser from performing their material obligations under this Agreement.

 

7.10 Litigation. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that shall be instituted or
threatened in writing against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise
challenge the legality of or seek damages in connection with this Agreement or
any Transaction. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the others of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that is instituted or
threatened in writing against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries,
Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be, that would have been listed in
Section 4.9 of the Disclosure Schedule or Section 5.6 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, if such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation had arisen prior to the date hereof. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate at Parents expense in (but not
control) the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation or claims
against the Company or any of its directors relating to the Offer or the
Merger, in each case which seek to prohibit or restrain the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall not settle or make an offer to settle
any litigation against the Company or any director by any stockholder relating
to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, without the prior written consent
of Parent.

7.11 Consents and Approvals.

 

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly (x)

applications, notices, petitions and filings (including, to the extent
necessary, any notification required by the HSR Act, as more specifically
addressed in Section 7.12) and (z) obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities that are
reasonably deemed necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions. The
Company shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents
required to be listed on Section 4.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. The
parties hereto shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining
of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations, and each party
will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion
of the Transactions. Parent and the Company shall each, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, use its best efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions. Parent and the Company, with respect to
any threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would
adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall use reasonable best efforts to
prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

(b) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of any of the Transactions relating to any such
consent or approval.

with the HSR Act with respect to the Offer and the Merger pursuant to this
Agreement, and (ii) shall file an antitrust notification in any other
jurisdiction if required by any Law. Each of Parent and the Company shall
furnish promptly to the FTC, the Antitrust Division and any other requesting
Governmental Authority any additional information requested by either of them

such filings. To the extent permitted by Law, each of Parent and the
Company shall consult in advance and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any foreign or other
antitrust Law. Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings or responses. In addition,
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any applicable
law, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other
parties to attend any meeting, communication, or conference with
any Governmental Authority in connection with such proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or any foreign or other antitrust Law.

 



-76- (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement
shall require Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to, and, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not take any
action to and shall not allow any of the Company Subsidiaries to, consent or
proffer to divest, hold separate, or enter into any license or similar
Contract with respect to, or agree to restrict the ownership or operation of,
any business or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries, except that, to the extent necessary to avoid the commencement
of any Action to prohibit any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or
if already commenced, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any Action
so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, Parent
will agree to license and/or divest rights and/or assets of the Company (or,
at Parents election, corresponding rights and/or assets of the Parent) that
in the aggregate generated no more than $3,000,000 in total revenue for the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Parent or
any of its subsidiaries or affiliates be obligated to litigate or participate

to make illegal, delaying materially or otherwise directly or indirectly
restraining or prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or
seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its subsidiaries any damages in
connection therewith, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or
place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or
any of their respective affiliates of all or any portion of the business or
assets of Parent or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or
to require any such person to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an
exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any portion of the
business or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries, in each case as a result of or in connection with the Offer or
the Merger, (iii) seeking, directly or indirectly, to impose or confirm
limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to acquire or
hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any Company Shares or any
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation on all matters properly
presented to the stockholders of the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
respectively, (iv) seeking to require divestiture by Parent, the Company or
any of their respective subsidiaries of any Company Shares or any business or
assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or Parent or its
subsidiaries, or (v) that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere
with, prevent or materially delay the Offer or the Merger or that would
reasonably be expected to dilute materially the benefits to Parent of the
Transactions (any of such actions, a "Burdensome Action").

reasonable best efforts to effect the Transactions. Each party hereto, at the
reasonable request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such
other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be

the Transactions. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company
hereby agrees to (and hereby agrees to cause its subsidiaries and the
Representatives of the Company and its subsidiaries to), (i) cooperate with

the Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts to cause its

income and cash flows and information reasonably required to assist in the

and to the extent that reasonable prior notice of such request shall have
been provided to Parent and Purchaser.

any U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to
allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, and (y) in connection with any
actions by the Company or the Company Board permitted by Section 7.5(c).

(iii) the Company shall have failed to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or to permit Parent to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents (it being agreed that the
delivery of a Notice of Designated Superior Proposal and any amendment or
update to such notice and the determination to so deliver such notice, update
or amendment and public disclosure with respect thereto shall not, by itself,
give rise to a right for Parent to terminate this Agreement); or

 

(f) By the Company, if there is an inaccuracy in the Parents or Purchasers
representations herein, or a breach by Parent or Purchaser of its covenants
herein, in either case that would reasonably be expected to be materially

(g) By the Company in order to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 7.5; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event of any termination of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee payable under Section 9.3(a)(iii) concurrently with such
termination. Any purported termination pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) that is

pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and
there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or
their respective officers, directors, stockholders, or affiliates; _provided_
, that, (a) Section 7.4(b) (Confidentiality), Section 7.16 (Public
Announcements), Section 9.3 (Fees), Section 10 (General Provisions) and this
Section 9.2 shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination
of this Agreement, and (b) such termination shall not relieve any party from
liability for any fraud or willful breach of its representations or warranties
or covenants hereunder. A termination of this Agreement shall not cause a
termination of the Confidentiality Agreement or any other agreement between
the parties.

9.3 Fees.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by Parent, Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) or
9.1(b)(ii) and (x) an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party shall have been
publicly announced after the date hereof and prior to such termination and (y)
within 12 months after such termination (A) the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (B) an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (with all references to 20% in the
definition thereof being treated as references to 50.1% for purposes of this
Section 9.3(a));

 

(ii) by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(e); or

 

(iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(g);

 

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee,
which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
The Termination Fee shall be paid (x) in the circumstances described in
clause (i) above, promptly (but in no event later than one (1) business day)
following the first to occur of the events giving rise to the obligation to
make such payment and (y) in the circumstances described in clause (iii)
above, concurrently with and as a condition to the termination.

 

(b) Subject to Section 9.3(c) below, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not any Transaction is consummated.

 



-81- (c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c) and
neither Parent nor Purchaser is in material breach of their respective
agreements contained in this Agreement or their respective representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company shall reimburse each of
Parent and Purchaser and their affiliates for all out-of-pocket expenses and
fees (including fees and expenses payable to all banks, investment banking
firms, other financial institutions and other persons and their respective
agents and counsel, for arranging, committing to provide or providing any
financing for the Transactions or structuring the Transactions and all fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, experts and consultants to Parent and
Purchaser, and all printing and advertising expenses) actually incurred or
accrued by either of them or on their behalf in connection with the
Transactions, including the financing thereof, and actually incurred or
accrued by banks, investment banking firms, other financial institutions and
other persons and assumed by Parent or Purchaser in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the
structuring and financing of the Transactions and any financing commitments or
agreements relating thereto in an amount not to exceed One Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) (all the foregoing being referred to
herein collectively as the "Expenses"). The Expenses shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds promptly following submission of
statements therefore. Such payment shall be in addition to, and not in lieu
of, all rights and remedies Parent and Purchaser may have in such
circumstances under this Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent
and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its affiliates
that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. The Company acknowledges and hereby
agrees that the provisions of this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without such provisions, Parent would not have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company shall fail to pay the
Termination Fee when due, the term "Termination Fee" shall be deemed to
include the costs and expenses incurred or accrued by Parent and Purchaser
(including fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this Section 9.3, together with interest on such
unpaid Termination Fee, commencing on the date that the Termination Fee became
due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by
Citibank, N.A. from time to time, in the City of New York, as such banks
Base Rate plus 5%. Similarly, if the Company shall fail to pay the Expenses
when due, the term "Expenses", as applicable, shall be deemed to include the
costs and expenses incurred or accrued by Parent and Purchaser (including
fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 9.3, together with interest on such unpaid
Expenses, commencing on the date that the Expenses became due, at a rate
equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, N.A. from time
to time, in the City of New York, as such banks Base Rate plus 5%.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parents right
to receive payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.3, in
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable, shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and 

 



-82-  Purchaser and their respective affiliates and any of their respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents or affiliates (the
"Parent Related Parties") against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
their respective affiliates and any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively, the
"Company Related Parties") for all any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, fees, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements), judgments, inquiries and fines suffered in respect of this
Agreement (including in respect of any breach, whether or not willful and
intentional, of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated) or the Transactions in such
circumstances, and upon payment of the Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to
this Section 9.3, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation to any of the Parent Related Parties relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

10.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

10.4 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement (other than Section 7 thereof) constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior and contemporaneous agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof (including Section 7 of the Confidentiality Agreement). This Agreement
shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or
otherwise), except that Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any of their
rights hereunder to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent so long as Parent
and Purchaser remain liable for all of the obligations contemplated under this
Agreement.

 

10.5 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than, (i) following the Acceptance Date, the rights
of holders of Company Shares to receive payment for the Company Shares
validly tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer or converted into cash
pursuant to the Merger and the rights of holders of Company Stock Options and
other convertible securities to receive payment pursuant to Section 3.7, and
(ii) after the Acceptance Date, Section 7.7 (which is intended to be for the
benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons).

 

10.6 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance

 



-84-  with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or
equity.

10.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law. All actions and proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court
of Chancery, or if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, then the
Federal courts located in the State of Delaware (collectively, the "Delaware
Courts"). The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Delaware Courts for the purpose of any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably
waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any
such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum,
that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the
Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

10.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. Each
of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.8.

 _Conditions to the Offer_

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, but subject to the terms of
this Agreement and in addition to (and not in limitation of) Purchasers
right to extend or amend the Offer at any time pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, pay
for any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer if:

(i) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Minimum Condition
shall not have been satisfied (and such Minimum Condition shall not be waived
or amended by Parent or Purchaser),

(ii) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have expired
or been terminated prior to the expiration of the Offer or any other required
consents or approvals of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
the absence of which would reasonably be expected to dilute materially the
anticipated benefits to Parent of the Transaction, shall not have expired,
been obtained or been terminated, as the case may be, prior to the expiration
of the Offer, or

 

(iii) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, any of the following
conditions shall exist:

 

(a) there shall have been instituted any Action, which is pending, by any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction:

 

(i) challenging or seeking to make illegal or otherwise, directly or
indirectly, restrain or prohibit, the acceptance for payment, payment for or
purchase of any Company Shares by Parent or Purchaser, or the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger;

(ii) seeking, in connection with the Transactions, to require Company, Parent
or Purchaser to take a Burdensome Action;

(iii) seeking to impose or confirm any material limitation on the ability of
Parent or Purchaser to acquire, hold or exercise effectively full rights of
ownership of any Company Shares, including the right to vote any Company
Shares acquired by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or otherwise on all
matters properly presented to the Companys stockholders;

(iv) seeking to require divestiture by Parent or Purchaser of any Company
Shares; or

(v) that otherwise (individually or in the aggregate with all other such
Actions) would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect;

 



A-1 (b) there shall have been any action taken, or any Law enacted, entered,
enforced, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed applicable to (i) Parent,
the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of Parent or the Company or (ii)
the Offer or the Merger, in each case by any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction, that is reasonably likely to result, directly or
indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in clause (a) above;

(c) any Effect since the date hereof shall have occurred that has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect, and such Effect shall be
continuing;

 

(d) (A) any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, other than Sections 4.3(b)(i), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii), 4.3(c),
4.4(a) and 4.4(b), shall not be true and correct (without giving effect to any
qualification as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein) as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as though
made on or as of such date (other than those representations and warranties
that address matters only as of a particular date or only with respect to a
specified period of time, which need only be true and correct as of such date
or with respect to such period), except, in each case, where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (B) any representation or warranty of the Company
set forth in Section 4.3(b)(i), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vi), or 4.3(c) shall not
be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of such
representation and warranty (which for purposes hereof shall be deemed
satisfied, and such representations and warranties shall be deemed true and
correct in all material respects, so long as any inaccuracy or combination of
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties does not result, in
aggregate, in an increase in the aggregate consideration otherwise payable by
Purchaser in the Offer and the Merger by more than $1,000,000), and (C) any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Section 4.4(a) or
4.4(b) shall not be true and correct in all respects as of immediately prior
to the expiration of the Offer as though made on or as of such date;

 

(e) the Company shall have failed to comply with or perform in any material
respect any covenants, obligations or agreements of the Company under this
Agreement and such failure shall not have been cured;

(f) the Company shall not have furnished Parent with a certificate dated as
of the date of determination signed on its behalf by any of the Companys
chairman of the board of directors or its chief executive officer or such
other officer serving in such capacity to the effect that the conditions set
forth in clauses (d) and (e) of this Annex A shall not have occurred; or

(g) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms or
the Offer shall have been terminated in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent and
subject to the terms of the Agreement and rules and regulations of the SEC,
may be asserted by Purchaser or Parent regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such condition or may be waived by Purchaser or Parent in whole
or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion,
_provided_ , that the Minimum Condition may not be waived, in each case,
subject to the terms of the Agreement and the rules and regulations of the
SEC. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right;

 



A-2  the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances; and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may
be asserted at any time and from time to time.

The capitalized terms used in this Annex A shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is attached.
