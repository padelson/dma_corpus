Section&nbsp;2.3; and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it will
take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event will the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent&#146;s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to
consummate the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing).&nbsp;In no event shall the Company be entitled to specifically enforce the terms of this Agreement other than solely under the specific
circumstances and as specifically set forth in Section 9.8(b)(i) and this Section 9.8(b)(ii).&nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to a remedy of specific performance or other equitable remedies against any
Financing Source. In no event shall the exercise of the Company&#146;s right to seek specific performance or other equitable remedy pursuant to this Section 9.8(b)(ii) prior to a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article&nbsp;VIII
limit the Company&#146;s right, in the event the Company is unable for any reason to obtain specific performance, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article&nbsp;VIII and to require payment of the Parent Termination Fee if entitled to payment
of the foregoing under Section 8.3(c); <I>provided</I>, that for the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (x) a grant of specific performance that causes the Merger to be consummated
and results in the Closing and (y) any Parent Termination Fee. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(iii) The Parties agree that, except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 9.8(b)(iii), in the event that specific performance or other equitable remedy is available to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 9.8(b)(ii), it shall be the Company&#146;s primary remedy in
connection with this Agreement with respect to breaches by Parent or Merger Sub of the obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger. If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific performance in connection with this Agreement, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article&nbsp;VIII and to require payment of the Parent
Termination Fee if entitled to payment of the foregoing under Section 8.3(c). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(iv) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section
9.8(b)(ii), the Parties agree not to raise any objections to the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity.&nbsp;Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(v) If
prior to the Termination Date any Party initiates a Legal Proceeding to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, then the Termination Date will be automatically
extended by (A) the amount of time during which such Legal Proceeding is pending plus 20 Business Days; or (B) such other time period established by the court presiding over such Legal Proceeding. </P>
