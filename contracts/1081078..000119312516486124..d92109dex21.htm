is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate
representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will
thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation;

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares, Dissenting
Company Shares and the Company Voting Stock) will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to $2.00, without interest thereon (the "Per Share Price"), in

-20- (c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who
shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in
writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory
rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Company Shares") will
not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price
pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share
Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common
Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.9.

(ii) The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to consult with
the Company concerning and to participate in all negotiations and Legal
Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to Delaware Law in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

 

(d) _Exchange of Subsidiary Exchangeable Stock_. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to cause the exchange
of the Subsidiary Exchangeable Stock for Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Exchange Documents prior to the Effective Time.

 

2.8 _Equity Awards_.

(a)  _Company_ _Restricted Stock Units_. Parent will not assume any Company
Restricted Stock Units and at the Effective Time each Company Restricted Stock
Unit outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested
or unvested, will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, in accordance with the terms of the Company
Stock Plan, be cancelled and terminated and converted into and will become a
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount
of the Per Share Price; multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit (the
"Company Restricted Stock Unit Consideration"). The payment of the Company
Restricted Stock Unit Consideration will be subject to withholding for all
required Taxes.

 



-21- (b) _Company Options_. Parent will not assume any Company Options and at the
Effective Time each Company Option outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plan, be cancelled and
terminated and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less
the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option) (it being
understood and agreed that such exercise price shall not actually be paid to
the Company by the holder of a Company Option); multiplied by (ii) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of
such Company Option (the "Option Consideration"). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to Company Options for which the
exercise price per share attributable to such Company Options is equal to or
greater than the Per Share Price, those Company Options will be cancelled and
terminated without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The payment
of the Option Consideration will be subject to withholding for all
required Taxes.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the aggregate (i) Company Restricted Stock Unit Consideration
owed to all holders of Company Restricted Stock Units; and (ii) Option
Consideration owed to all holders of Company Options. On the first regularly
scheduled payroll date of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time,
the applicable holders of Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Options
will receive a payment from the Surviving Corporation, through its
payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to
such holders in respect of Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Options
that are cancelled and terminated and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or
Section 2.8(b), as applicable. All such payments will be less any applicable
withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a
holder of Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Options pursuant to Section
2.8(a) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable, cannot be made through the Companys
or the Surviving Corporations payroll system or payroll provider, then the
Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder,
which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly
following the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time. All such payments will be less any
applicable withholding Taxes.

 

(d) _Further Actions_. The Company will take all action necessary to effect
the cancellation of Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Options at the
Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the
satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act).

 

(e) _Company Stock Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
all actions necessary (including adopting such resolutions of the Company
Board (or any appropriate committee thereof) and providing all required
notices in connection therewith) to terminate the Company Stock Plan and to
ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Person shall have any right with
respect to outstanding Company equity based awards except as provided in this
Section 2.8.

 



-22- 2.9 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will (i) select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent"); and (ii) enter into a
payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Payment Agent.

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate
consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent,
as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or
fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a
maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank
that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the
"Exchange Fund"). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to
any investments of the Exchange Fund; or (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for
any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the
cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments
contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund
will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder
of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate
or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company
Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates"); and (ii) uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock that represented outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares)
(the "Uncertificated Shares") (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share
Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates
so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an

 



-23-  "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated
Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred
Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable
withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment
Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price,
without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of
Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7.

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will
cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository
Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or
prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment
Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in
cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (A) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and
Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately
prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price (such
amount, the "DTC Payment"); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30
a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit
the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date.

 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been
paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the applicable Per Share Price
with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in
whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



-24- (g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the
Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders
may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two years after
the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of
or otherwise be treated as abandoned property by, any Governmental Authority,
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously
entitled thereto.

 

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist;
and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable
therefor upon the surrender or transfer thereof in accordance with Section
2.7, or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant
to Section 2.7(c). The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with
the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

2.11  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue
in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



-25- 2.12 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company
Options such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
pursuant to any Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

2.13 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company
and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all
such lawful and necessary action.

organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL; and (b)
has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it
is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the
extent that the concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so

 



-26-  qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
true, correct and complete copies of the Charter and the Amended and Restated
Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws"), each as amended to date. The Company is
not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws.

 

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement; (b) perform
its covenants and obligations hereunder; and (c) subject to receiving the

delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of
its covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and no additional corporate actions on the part of the Company
are necessary to authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder; or (iii) subject to the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally; and
(B) is subject to general principles of equity (the foregoing (A) and (B), the
"Enforceability Limitations").

 

3.3 _Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws_.

 

(a) _Company Board Approval_. The Company Board, by resolutions duly adopted
by unanimous vote, has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of,
and fair to, the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to
enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein; (ii) approved the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its
covenants and other obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger
upon the terms and conditions set forth herein; (iii) declared the
advisability of this Agreement; (iv) resolved to recommend that the Company
Stockholders adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger in accordance with
the DGCL (collectively, the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), the "Company
Board Recommendation") and directed that this Agreement be submitted to the
Company Stockholders and holders of Subsidiary Exchangeable Stock for purposes
of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval in compliance with applicable
Law, the Charter and the Bylaws. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Company Board Recommendation has not been withdrawn, rescinded or modified in
any way.

an oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) of its financial advisor,
Jefferies LLC (the "Advisor"), to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion and based upon and subject to the various qualifications and
assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Price to be paid to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Vintage Albany Acquisition, LLC,
Steel Excel, Inc., the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub) pursuant to this Agreement is
fair from a financial point of view to such holders, and, as of the date of
this Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified. It
is understood and

 



-27-  agreed by the Parties that such written opinion is for the benefit of the
Company Board (in its capacity as such) and may not be relied upon by Parent
or Merger Sub. The Company will provide a copy of such written opinion
promptly after the date of this Agreement.

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Assuming that the representations of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true and correct, the Company Board
has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or other
similar applicable "anti-takeover" Law will not be applicable to the Merger.

 

3.4 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. Either the (x) affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock

holders who would have been entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all
stockholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting, including, in
each case, a majority of the voting power of the Company Voting Stock (the
"Requisite Stockholder Approval"), is the only approval of the holders of any
Company Capital Stock that is necessary pursuant to applicable Law, the
Charter or the Bylaws to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

3.5  _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger do not (a) violate or conflict
with any provision of the Charter or the Bylaws; (b) violate, conflict with,
result in the breach of, constitute a default (or an event that, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) pursuant to,
result in the termination of, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in a right of termination or acceleration pursuant to any Material
Contract; (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.6
and, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate or conflict with any Law or Order
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their
respective properties or assets are bound; or (d) result in the creation of
any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses
(b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations, amendments, accelerations or Liens that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.6 _Requisite Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, Order or
authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to (any of the
foregoing, a "Consent") any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained
or made by the Company (a) in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company; (b) the performance by the Company of its

qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent

substantially the same manner that such business is conducted on the date of

convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest (including any voting debt) in, any Subsidiary of
the Company; or (iii) obligations of any Subsidiary of the Company to grant,
extend or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or

Subsidiaries.

statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other information
incorporated by reference) with or furnished to, as applicable, the SEC that

prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company SEC Reports"). Each Company
SEC Report complied, as of its filing date, in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
Company SEC Reports, each as in effect on the date that such Company SEC

superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of
such amended or superseded filing), each Company SEC Report, including any
financial statements, schedules or exhibits included or incorporated by
reference therein at the time they were filed (or, if amended or superseded
by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such amended
or superseded filing) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made

misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or

Agreement: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their respective
dates; (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes

respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of

of the Company or any off-balance sheet arrangements of the type required to
be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the
SEC.

(b) _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms,
including controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is
timely accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure of such information in
the Companys periodic and current reports required under the Exchange Act.
For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The management of the Company has completed an assessment
of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
as of November 30, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such controls
were effective as of such date. The Company has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date
of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board and on Section 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"
and "material weakness" shall have the meaning assigned to them in Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 2, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

 



-32- (c) _Internal Controls_. The Company has established and maintains a system of
internal accounting controls that are, and have been for the five years
immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed and assets are
accessed only in accordance with managements authorization; (ii) the
Companys financial reporting is reliable and the preparation of the Companys
financial statements is in accordance with GAAP and applicable Law, (ii) that
receipts and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Company Board,
and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys and its Subsidiaries assets
that could have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.
Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Companys
independent registered public accounting firm has identified (A) any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal control
over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries that has
not been subsequently remediated; or (B) any fraud that involves
the Companys management or other employees who have a role in the
preparation of financial statements or the internal control over financial
reporting utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any
joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract
(including any Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any
"off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material Liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
Companys or such Subsidiarys published financial statements or other
Company SEC Reports.

(e) _Indebtedness_. Section 3.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains
a true, correct and complete list of all Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, other than Indebtedness
reflected in the Audited Company Balance Sheet or otherwise included in the
Company SEC Reports.

the principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal
executive officer and each former principal financial officer of the Company,
as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
with respect to the Company SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate in all material respects. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding (nor has arranged
or modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any "extensions of
credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to
directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is otherwise in
compliance with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules of NASDAQ, except for any
non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



-33- 3.11 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any Liabilities of a nature required to be reflected or
reserved against on a balance sheet (or the notes thereto) prepared in
accordance with GAAP, other than Liabilities (a) reflected or otherwise
reserved against in the Audited Company Balance Sheet or in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the notes
thereto) included in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement; (b) arising pursuant to this Agreement or incurred in connection
with the Merger; (c) incurred in the ordinary course of business on or after
December 1, 2015; and (d) that would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(a) _No Company Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date of the Audited
Company Balance Sheet through the date of this Agreement, the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has been conducted, in all material respects, in
the ordinary course of business. Since the date of the Audited Company Balance
Sheet through the date of this Agreement, there has not occurred a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Forbearance_. Since the date of the Audited Company Balance Sheet through
the date of this Agreement, the Company has not taken any action that would
be prohibited by Section 5.2 if taken or proposed to be taken after the date
of this Agreement.

definition of Material Contract filed by the Company with the SEC and
any Material Contracts listed in Section 3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure

Company, any of its Subsidiaries party thereto or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other party thereto is in breach of or default pursuant to any
such Material Contract, except for such failures to be in full force and
effect that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No event has
occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a
breach or default pursuant to any Material Contract by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party
thereto, except for such breaches and defaults that would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

licensed, used or held for use by the Company or any Subsidiary in connection
with its business as presently conducted. Notwithstanding anything herein to

or any of its Subsidiaries products infringes, misappropriates or otherwise
violates the Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person or constitutes
unfair competition or unfair trade practices pursuant to the Laws of any
jurisdiction in a manner that has or could reasonably be expected to result
in a material Liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(j) _No Third Person Infringement_. Since December 1, 2013, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided any third Person with written
notice claiming that such third Person is infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating any material Company Intellectual Property Right, and,
except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge
of the Company, no such activity is occurring that has resulted in a material
Liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

taken reasonable steps to protect the Companys and its Subsidiaries rights
in the Companys confidential information and trade secrets that it wishes to

reasonable efforts to enforce a policy requiring each officer and employee
engaged in the development of any Intellectual Property Rights or Technology
for the Company or its Subsidiaries to execute a proprietary information and
confidentiality agreement. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Person who is or was involved in the
creation, development, or maintenance of any Company Intellectual Property
Rights has signed an agreement containing (1) an irrevocable assignment of all
Intellectual Property Rights to the Company or its Subsidiary and/or a work-
made-for-hire agreement under the U.S. Copyright Act or analogous provision of
applicable non-U.S. Law vesting in the Company or its Subsidiary exclusively
all Intellectual Property Rights developed or enhanced during the course of
the Persons relationship with the Company or its Subsidiary and for any
period thereafter, if applicable and (2) confidentiality provisions protecting

products of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would prevent the same
from performing materially in accordance with their user specifications; and

in any of the same. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company and its
Subsidiaries possess all Technology used by the Company and its Subsidiaries
in the development and maintenance of the products of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, except as would not be material to the operations of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have not disclosed, delivered, licensed or otherwise
made available, and do not have a duty or obligation (whether present,
contingent, or otherwise) to disclose, deliver, license, or otherwise make

Person, except as would not be material to the operations of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

to, or is otherwise subject to, an open source, public-source, freeware or
other third party license agreement that, in each case, requires the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose or license any material
proprietary source code that embodies material Company Intellectual Property
Rights for any product of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that
requires any material product to be made available at no charge, except, in

amendments thereto) relating to any and all Taxes ("Tax Returns") required to
be filed by any of them; and (ii) paid, or have adequately reserved ( in
accordance with GAAP) for the payment of, all Taxes that are required to be

Reports reflect an adequate reserve (in accordance with GAAP) for all material
Taxes accrued but not then payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries through
the date of such financial statements. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has executed any waiver, except in connection with any ongoing

or withheld. The Company has undertaken in good faith to classify
appropriately all service providers as either employees or independent
contractors for all Tax purposes.

 

(e) _No Audits_. No audits or other examinations with respect to income or
other material Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are presently
in progress or have been asserted or proposed in writing. No written claim has
ever been made by a Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the Company or
such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is or may be subject to tax in that
jurisdiction.

material Liability for the Taxes of any Person other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or non-United States Law) as a transferee or
successor, or otherwise by operation of Law.

employment, bonus, stock option, stock purchase or other equity-based,
benefit, incentive compensation, profit sharing, savings, retirement,
disability, insurance, vacation, deferred compensation, severance,
termination, retention, change of control and other similar material fringe,
welfare or other employee benefit plans, programs, agreement, contracts,
policies or binding arrangements (whether or not in writing) maintained or
contributed to for the benefit of any current employee or director of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other trade or business (whether or
not incorporated) that would be treated as a single employer with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA
Affiliate") and with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has any current material Liability, contingent or otherwise (collectively, the

material modification; (D) any related trust agreements, insurance contracts,

and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
with all applicable Law, including the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and any applicable
regulatory guidance issued by any Governmental Authority, and the Company has
not received any notice issued by any Government Authority questioning or
challenging such compliance. Each Employee Plan intended to be "qualified"
under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the Company has received
a favorable determination letter or is entitled, under applicable IRS
guidance, to rely on a current favorable opinion or advisory letter from the
IRS, as to the tax qualification of such Employee Plan. Nothing has occurred
since the date of any such opinion or determination letter that would
reasonably be expected to cause the IRS to revoke such determination
or adversely affect such qualified status. The Company has, in all material
respects, timely paid or made all contributions, distributions, reimbursements
and premium payments required under or with respect to each Employee Plan,
and, with respect to benefits that have accrued under any unfunded Employee
Plan, has paid or properly accrued or otherwise adequately reserved to the

administration or operation of such plans, other than routine claims for
benefits that have been or are being handled through an administrative claims
procedure.

 

(e) _No Prohibited Transactions_. No fiduciary (within the meaning of Section

nothing has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could reasonably
be expected to subject the Company to any such Taxes.

as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law.

 



-42- (g) _N_ _o Additional Rights_. None of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger will, either alone or in

of any amount or provision of any benefit (including accelerated vesting) that
could constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code or subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.
The Company does not have any obligation to gross up, indemnify or otherwise
reimburse any Person for any Taxes (or potential Taxes) imposed (or
potentially imposed) pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

 

(i) _Section 409A_. Each Employee Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the

correct list of all standard warranty terms delivered by the Company or its
Subsidiaries on the Companys or its Subsidiaries standard forms in

committed or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements or
other understandings (whether or not binding) with any stockholder (other
than any existing limited partner of Guarantor or any of its Affiliates),
director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which any (a) such holder of Company Common Stock
would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature
than the Per Share Price in respect of such holders shares of Company Common
Stock; (b) such holder of Company Common Stock has agreed to approve this
Agreement or vote against any Superior Proposal; or (c) such stockholder,
director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company other than

respective Affiliates is a party to any Contract as to continuing employment
from and after the Effective Time with any stockholder (other than any
existing limited partner of Guarantor or any of its Affiliates), director,
officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

4.13 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time and immediately after giving effect
to the Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to
Article II in connection with or as a result of the Merger and all related
fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries in connection therewith), assuming (a) satisfaction of the
conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger,
and after giving effect to the Merger, including the Financing, (b) any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt
Commitment Letters, (c) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Article III, without giving effect to any materiality
or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications set forth therein, and
compliance by the Company with the covenants and other agreements of the
Company contained herein, (d) payment of all amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and (e) that any estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that have been provided by the Company to Parent
prior to the date hereof were prepared based upon assumptions that were, at
the time made, and continue to be, at the Effective Time, reasonable, (i) the
amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of each of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed (1) the value of all liabilities
of the Surviving Corporation and such Subsidiaries, including contingent and

probable liabilities of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
on their existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and matured; (ii) each of the Surviving Corporation and its

as they mature. For purposes of the foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including

due.

Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is involved in

Sub, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that,
except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article

its Subsidiaries or any of their businesses, operations or otherwise in

any of its or their respective Affiliates or Representatives to make any

or the Merger, and if made, such representation or warranty must not be
relied upon by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives as having been authorized by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Affiliates or Representatives
(or any other Person on their behalf);

(c) the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement
are in lieu of and are exclusive of all other representations and warranties,
including any express or implied or as to merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose, and the Company hereby disclaims any other or implied
representations or warranties, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives of
any documentation or other information (including any financial information,
supplemental data or financial projections or other forward-
looking statements); and

(d) any forecasts, budgets, projections, estimates or other information
provided by the Company or any Representative of the Company to Parent or

date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have ceased any and
all discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and terminated such Persons access to any
data room containing the Companys confidential information, and, following
the execution of this Agreement, will use reasonable best efforts to request
the return from all such Persons or the destruction by such Persons of all
copies of confidential information previously provided to such Persons by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or Representatives. Subject to the terms of Section
5.3(b), from the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
the Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and will not instruct, authorize
or knowingly permit any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors
(collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or
knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
furnish to any Person (other than to Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of
Parent or Merger Sub) any non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any Person access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any
personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Parent,
Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub), or take any other action
with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to
knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate or engage in discussions
or negotiations with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than informing such Persons of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3);
(iv) approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; or (v) enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition
Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (any such
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

 

(b) _Superior_ _Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Section 5.3 (except as set forth in clause (iii) of Section 5.3(a)),
from the date of this Agreement until the Companys receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives from any Person a _bona fide_ ,
written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal not resulting from a material
breach of Section 5.3 of this Agreement, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their
Representatives (including the Advisor), participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information,
or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to such Person or its Representatives if
and only if (i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions contemplated by this
Section 5.3(b) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under

 



-61-  Delaware Law; and (iii) the Company has given Parent written notice of the
identity of such Person, a copy of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into with such Person, a copy of such Acquisition Proposal and notice
of the Companys intention to participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish non-public information to, such Person; and
_provided_ _further_ , that the Company will promptly (and in any event
within one Business Day) make available to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such
Person or its Representatives that was not previously made available to
Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate, amend, modify or waive
any rights under, or release any Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub)
from, any "standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Person, on the other, unless
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

 

(c) _No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Except as provided by Section 5.3(d), at no time
after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board (or a committee
thereof):

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect; (B) publicly adopt,
approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition
Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within 10 Business Days after Parent so requests in writing with respect to
the first request by Parent and within 5 Business Days after Parent so
requests in writing thereafter (it being understood that the Company will have
no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than two separate occasions);
(D) take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make
any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or
exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop,
look and listen" communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication); or (E) to the
extent applicable, fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a "Company
Board Recommendation Change"); _provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance
of doubt, neither (1) the determination by the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal nor (2)
the delivery by the Company of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(b) to
Parent, will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change; or

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 



-62- (d) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval:

 

(i) other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or an
authorized committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change in response to any material event or material change in circumstances
with respect to the Company that (A) was not known or reasonably foreseeable
to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement; and (B) does not
relate to any Acquisition Proposal (each such event, an "Intervening Event"),
if the Company Board (or an authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to
do so in light of such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law if and only if:

 

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or an
authorized committee thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section
5.3(d)(i), which notice will specify the applicable Intervening Event in
reasonable detail;

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
and its Representatives, during such four Business Day period, must have (A)
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board (or an authorized
committee thereof) no longer determines that the failure to make a Company
Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; and (B) permitted
Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board
regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the
extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation); and

 

(3) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company during such four Business
Day period a written and binding offer to modify the terms of this Agreement,
the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) shall have determined
in good faith, after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the
failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in light of
such Intervening Event would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Delaware Law.

(ii) if the Company has received an unsolicited, written bona fide
Acquisition Proposal not resulting from a material breach of Section 5.3 of
this Agreement, that the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the
Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, in each case if and only if:

(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law;

 



-63- (2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
pursuant to this Section 5.3 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;

(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five
Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") to the effect that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(ii) absent any revision to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for
such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the
identity of the Person of "group" of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents relating to
such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives,
during the Notice Period, must have (1) negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and (2) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments
with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such
a presentation); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any material
revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 5.3(d)(ii)(3) with respect to such new written notice (it being
understood that the "Notice Period" in respect of such new written notice will
be three Business Days);

 

(4) following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith any revisions to this Agreement offered in writing
by Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the
Company, and shall have determined in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and, after consultation
with outside counsel, the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement to accept the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law;
and

 

(5) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
will have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h),
including paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section
8.3(b)(iii).

(e) _Notice_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective
Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify
Parent if any director or executive officer of the Company becomes aware of
any receipt by the Company of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request
for non-public information that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with respect to, or which would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, which notice
shall include the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry (and shall include with such notice copies of any written

 



-64-  materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such
Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

(f) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company

to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, including a "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication) if the Company determines, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such

Person of the terms of this Section 5.3; (iii) making any disclosure to
the Company Stockholders that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
determined to make in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal

disclosure would constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided_ that, in
each case, any such statement(s) or disclosures made by the Company Board
and/or any committee thereof will be subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including the provisions of Article VIII, and will not limit
or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company Board and
the rights of Parent under this Section 5.3.

voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or
businesses of Parent or Merger Sub (or their respective Affiliates), on the
one hand, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand; _provided,
further_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub (nor their respective
Affiliates) shall be required to take any action that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse impact
on the reasonably expected benefits to Parent or Merger Sub (or their
respective Affiliates) of completing the Merger.

 

6.3 _Stockholder Consent; Information Statement; Proxy Statement and Other
Required SEC Filings_.

 

(a) _Information Statement; Proxy Statement_. Promptly following the date of
this Agreement and, in any event within ten (10) days following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall, with the assistance and approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld) of Parent, (i) in the event that a Stockholder Consent
is delivered to the Company, prepare and file with the SEC an information
statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act related to the Merger and this Agreement (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "Information Statement"), or (ii) in
the event that a Stockholder Consent is not delivered to the Company and this
Agreement is not terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), prepare and
file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented,
the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject
to Section 5.3, to the extent the Proxy Statement will be filed with the SEC
in accordance with this Section 6.3(a), the Company must include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Information Statement or
Proxy Statement, as applicable, cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable
after such filing (including by responding to comments of the SEC).

(b) _Stockholder Consent_. The Company shall take no action to prohibit
any Company Stockholder from soliciting a Stockholder Consent, the form of
such irrevocable written consent is attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , from any
Company Stockholder in compliance with

 



-67-  applicable Law, the Charter and the Bylaws following the execution of this
Agreement by the Company. If a Stockholder Consent is received by the Company,
promptly upon receipt of such Stockholder Consent, the Company will provide
Parent with a facsimile copy of such Stockholder Consent, and, no later than
8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 29, 2016, will provide Parent with a
certificate (the "Stockholder Consent Certificate"), certifying such
Stockholder Consent as true and complete (including that the shareholdings
included therein are in accordance with the Companys books and records and
that the Stockholder Consent constitutes the Requisite Stockholder Approval)
and executed by an executive officer of the Company.

(c) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Information Statement or Proxy
Statement, as applicable, with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant
to applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an "Other
Required Company Filing"), then the Company will promptly prepare and file
such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Information Statement or
Proxy Statement, as applicable, and any Other Required Company Filing to
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and NASDAQ. The Company may not file
the Information Statement, Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing, as applicable, with the SEC without first providing Parent and its
counsel, to the extent practicable, a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon, which comments shall be considered by the Company in good
faith. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders
(if applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, as
applicable, none of the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as
applicable, or any Other Required Company Filing will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with respect
to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information Statement or
Proxy Statement, as applicable, or any Other Required Company Filing. The
information supplied by the Company or its Affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at
the time that such Other Required Parent Filing is filed with the SEC, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

(d) _Other Required Parent Filing_. If Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates determines that it is required to file any document with
the SEC in connection with the Merger, a Stockholder Consent or the Company
Stockholder Meeting pursuant to applicable Law (an "Other Required Parent
Filing"), then Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, promptly prepare and file such Other Required Parent Filing
with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub will cause, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to cause, any Other Required Parent Filing to comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC. Neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any
of their respective Affiliates may file any Other Required Parent Filing (or
any amendment thereto) with the SEC without first providing the Company and
its counsel, to the extent practicable, a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company
Stockholders (if

 



-68-  applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, as
applicable, no Other Required Company Filing will contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Parent or Merger
Sub with respect to any information supplied by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in any Other Required Company Filing. The
information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing will not, at the time that the Information Statement
or Proxy Statement, as applicable, or such Other Required Company Filing is
filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

 

(e) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will furnish all information concerning it
and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may reasonably request
in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Information
Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, or any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing. As promptly as practicable after
the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, shall have been
cleared by the SEC (or, in the case of the Information Statement, after ten
(10) calendar days have passed since the filing of the preliminary
Information Statement with the SEC without notice from the SEC of its intent
to review the Information Statement), the Company shall cause the Information
Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, to be mailed to its Company
Stockholders and to be filed as required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior
to filing or mailing the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as
applicable (or any amendment or supplement thereto, as applicable) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto or with respect to
any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, the
Company (i) shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and (ii) shall include in such document
or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If any information
relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, or
any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the
case may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such
information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement to such filing describing such information will be
promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate Party and, to the
extent required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the
Company Stockholders.

 

(f) _Consultation Prior to Certain Communications_. The Company and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, without
first providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such written communication, which comments shall be considered by
the filing party in good faith.

 



-69- (g) _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any
Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt of
comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any Other Required
Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; or
(iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional
information in connection therewith.

(h) _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from
the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the
Proxy Statement.

6.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. In the event that a Stockholder
Consent is not delivered to the Company and this Agreement is not terminated
by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), (i) unless the Company Board has made a
Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company Board Recommendation shall be
included in the Proxy Statement and (ii) the Company shall take all
action necessary in accordance with applicable Law, the Charter, the Bylaws
and the rules of NASDAQ to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Once the Company has established
the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall not
change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent, unless
required by applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company shall hold the Company Stockholder Meeting no later than 45
calendar days after (i) the tenth calendar day after the preliminary Proxy
Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC if by such date the SEC has not
informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or (ii) if
the SEC has, by the tenth calendar day after the preliminary Proxy Statement
has been filed with the SEC, informed the Company that it intends to review
the Proxy Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has
no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 5.3 and
applicable Law, and unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to
obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are
holders of an insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present or
represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a
quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting; or (ii) the Company is required to
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, Order
or a request from the SEC or 

 



-70-  its staff. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, the Company will submit this Agreement and the Merger to its
stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting even if the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.

6.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) _No Amendments to_ _Financing Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the Financing Letters if such amendment, modification or
waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing is increased by an
equivalent amount) below the amount described in Section 4.11(c); (ii) impose
new or additional conditions or other terms, or otherwise expand, amend
or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing, in each
case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent
the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing, or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, less likely to
occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent or the
Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. Any
reference in this Agreement to (1) the "Financing" will include the financing
contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or modified in compliance
with this Section 6.5(a); and (2) "Equity Commitment Letter," "Debt
Commitment Letters" or "Financing Letters" will include such documents as
amended or modified in compliance with this Section 6.5(a). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Parent and Merger Sub shall not release,
waive or reduce (below the amount described in Section 4.11(c)) or consent to
the termination of the Debt Commitment Letters or the obligations of the
lenders thereunder without the prior written consent of the Company (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except for replacements of
the Debt Commitment Letters with alternative financing commitments pursuant to
Section 6.5(d) and the appointment of Additional Arrangers (as defined in the
Senior Debt Commitment Letter) in accordance with Section 2 of the Senior Debt
Commitment Letter.

 

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, compliance with
any flex provisions) described in the Financing Letters and any Fee Letter,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Financing Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof; (ii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements
with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters and any related Fee Letters (or on terms
otherwise no less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent and Merger Sub than
such terms and conditions); (iii) satisfy (or, if applicable, obtain waivers
of) on a timely basis all conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent
and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letters and such definitive agreements
thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letter; (iv) consummate the Financing at
or prior to the Closing including by using reasonable best efforts to cause
the Financing Sources to fund the Financing at Closing;

 



-71-  (v) comply in all material respects with its obligations under the Financing
Letters and (vi) enforce its rights pursuant to the Financing Letters. Parent
and Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or
other fees arising pursuant to the Financing Letters as and when they become
due.

(c)  _Information_. Parent must (i) use reasonable best efforts to keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of
material developments concerning the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing; and (ii) provide the Company with copies of all final drafts prior
to execution thereof and all executed copies of material definitive agreements
related to the Debt Financing; _provided_ that the Parent and Merger Sub will
not be required to disclose or provide any information the disclosure of
which in the reasonable good faith judgment thereof is prohibited by
applicable Law or Order, is subject to attorney-client privilege or would
reasonably be expected to result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or violate any obligation of Parent or Merger Sub with respect
to confidentiality (including pursuant to a Contract) not entered into to
avoid the disclosure obligations of this sentence. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub will give the Company
prompt notice (A) of any breach (or breach threatened in writing) or default
(or any event or circumstance that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any
party to the Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware; (B) of the receipt by
Parent or Merger Sub of any oral or written notice or communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any (1) breach (or breach threatened in
writing), default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing
Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any
provisions of the Financing Letters or such definitive agreements; or (2)
written dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing
Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Parent
or Merger Sub becomes aware; _provided_ that the Parent and Merger Sub will
not be required to disclose or provide any information the disclosure of which
in the reasonable good faith judgment thereof is prohibited by applicable Law
or Order, is subject to attorney-client privilege or would reasonably be
expected to result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or
violate any obligation of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to confidentiality
(including pursuant to a Contract) not entered into to avoid the disclosure
obligations of this sentence; and (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub
at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of
the Financing sufficient to make the payments described in Section 4.11(c) on
the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent will
provide information reasonably requested by the Company regarding any of the
circumstances referred to in the previous sentence promptly (but in any event
with two Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers a written
request therefor to Parent.

 

(d) _Alternate Debt Financing_. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters and Parent is therefore not able
to make the payments described in Section 4.11(c), Parent and Merger Sub will
use reasonable best efforts to arrange, as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, to (i) obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in
the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters and any related Fee Letters and in an amount at least
equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof sufficient to
make the payments

 



-72-  described in Section 4.11(c), as the case may be (the "Alternate Debt
Financing"); and (ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with
respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the "New Debt Commitment Letters"),
which new letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole
or in part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment
Letters to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters
(and any fee letters in connection therewith) are obtained, (A) any reference
in this Agreement to the "Financing Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letters"
will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not
superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect; (B) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to
the foregoing; and (C) any reference to the "Fee Letters" will be deemed to
include any new fee letters provided in connection with the New Debt
Commitment Letters.

(e) _Enforcement of Equity Commitment Letter_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section
6.5(e) will require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of
Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or
Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement action against any source of the
Equity Financing to enforce its rights pursuant to the Equity Commitment
Letter (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub will seek to enforce,
including by bringing suit for specific performance, the Equity Commitment
Letter if the Company seeks and is granted a decree of specific performance of
the obligation to consummate the Merger after all conditions to the granting
thereof set forth in Section 9.8(b) have been satisfied); or (ii) seek the
Equity Financing from any source other than a counterparty to, or in any
amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter.

 

6.6 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its
respective reasonable best efforts, to provide Parent with all cooperation
reasonably necessary in connection with satisfying the conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letters or as is otherwise reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with arranging, obtaining and/or syndicating the Debt Financing,
including:

(i) participating (and causing senior management and Representatives, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company, to participate) in a
reasonable and limited number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies
and prospective lenders and their respective advisors, and otherwise
cooperating with the marketing efforts for any of the Debt Financing;

 

(ii) assisting Parent and the Financing Sources with the timely preparation of
(i) customary rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda and
other documentation required in connection with the Financing; and (ii)
forecasts of financial statements of the Surviving Corporation for one or more

foregoing clause (ii), in no event shall the Company be required to provide
pro forma financial statements or pro forma adjustments (including regarding
any pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization and other post-
Closing or pro forma adjustments) other than pro forma adjustments for

 



-73-  one or more periods following the Closing of the same type as those provided
by the Company in forecasts of financial statements of the Surviving
Corporation prior to the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ , that the
foregoing proviso shall not be deemed to exclude information reasonably
required to prepare pro forma statements;

 

(iii) assisting Parent in connection with the timely preparation of (but not
executing, unless effective only at or following the Effective Time) any
pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements and
other definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent
or the Financing Sources (including using reasonable best efforts to obtain
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Debt Financing and accountants comfort letters, in each case as
reasonably requested by Parent), and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral and the granting of security interests in respect of
the Debt Financing, it being understood that such documents will not take
effect until the Effective Time;

 

(iv) furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources, as promptly as practicable,
with financial, business and other material information regarding the Company
and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent and that is
customarily included in or required for a financing comparable to the Debt
Financing and all other financial information necessary for the
satisfaction of the obligations and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters, including the financial statements described in Section 6
of Annex B to the Senior Debt Commitment Letter and the financial statements
described in Section 5 of Annex B to the Subordinated Debt Commitment Letter,
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.6(a)(iv) but
subject to Section 6.6(a)(ii), in no event shall the Company be required to
provide pro forma financial statements or pro forma adjustments (including
regarding any pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization and other
post-Closing or pro forma adjustments); _provided_ , that the foregoing
proviso shall not be deemed to exclude information reasonably required
to prepare pro forma statements;

(v) cooperating with Parent to obtain customary and reasonable corporate and
facilities ratings, consents, landlord waivers and estoppels, non-disturbance
agreements, non-invasive environmental assessments, legal opinions, surveys
and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent, including in connection
with any arrangements to be effectuated after the Closing;

(vi) reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral (including obtaining
and delivering any pay-off letters and other cooperation in connection with
the repayment or other retirement of existing indebtedness and the release and
termination of any and all related Liens) on or prior to the Closing Date;

 

(vii) delivering notices of prepayment within the time periods required by the
relevant agreements governing indebtedness and obtaining customary payoff
letters, Lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at the
Closing, and giving any other necessary notices, to allow for the payoff,
discharge and termination in full at the Closing of all indebtedness;

 



-74- (viii) taking all corporate and other actions, subject to the occurrence of
the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to (1) permit the consummation of
the Debt Financing, and (2) cause the direct borrowing or incurrence of all of
the proceeds of the Debt Financing by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries concurrently with or immediately following the Effective Time;
and

(ix) timely furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources with all documentation
and other information required by regulatory authorities about the Company
and its Subsidiaries relating to applicable "know your customer" and anti-

(b) _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this Section 6.6 will require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay pursuant to the Debt Financing any fees or reimburse

reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent; (ii)
enter into any definitive agreement (except as expressly set forth in this
Section 6.6); (iii) give any indemnities in connection with the Financing that
are effective prior to the Effective Time; or (iv) take any action that would
unreasonably and materially interfere with the conduct of the business or the
Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or create an unreasonable and
material risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole). In addition, (A) no action,
Liability or obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument in respect of the Debt Financing will be
effective until the Effective Time, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to take any action pursuant to any definitive
Debt Financing documentation that is not contingent on the occurrence of the
Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective Time; and (B) any
bank information memoranda or other documentation required in relation to the
Debt Financing will contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries as the obligor. Nothing in this
Section 6.6 will require (1) any officer or Representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any
other action under this Section 6.6 that could reasonably be expected to
result in personal Liability to such officer or Representative; or (2) the
Company Board to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto.

 

(c) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing so long as such logos
(i) are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) are used solely in
connection with a description of the Company, its business and products, the
Merger or the Debt Financing.

(d)  _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose
such information to any financing sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to
the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement
agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in

 



-75-  each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons
(i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto;
or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a beneficiary.

(e) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will
reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Representatives to the extent resulting from the cooperation of the Company

(f) _Indemnification_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives will be indemnified and held harmless by Parent from and
against any and all Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses
(including attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them to the extent
resulting from their cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing pursuant to
this Agreement or the provision of information utilized in connection
therewith (other than information provided by or on behalf of the Company),
in each case, except for any Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses (including attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties
and amounts paid (i) to the extent resulting from the fraud, willful
misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or gross negligence on the part of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the respective
Representatives thereof or (ii) that are punitive, special,
consequential, incidental, exemplary or otherwise not actual damages, in the
nature of lost profits, or any diminution in value of property or equity
(except, in each case, to the extent actually paid or payable to a non-
affiliated third party pursuant to a final and non-appealable judgment or
arbitral decision). Parents obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(e) and this
Section 6.6(f) referred to collectively as the "Reimbursement Obligations."

 

(g) _N_ _o Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and
agree that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing. If the
Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to
be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger.

 

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board will (a) take all
actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b)
if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Merger, take all action within their power to ensure that
the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger.

 

6.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
the Company will afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties,
books and records and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except
that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or
information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law or regulation
requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information would
give

 



-76-  rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or
information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the
rights pursuant to, such Contract; or (d) access would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons; and provided further,
however, that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section
6.8 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty set
forth in this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available
to any Party hereunder. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of
the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Companys reasonable
security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to
perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or
any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8. All requests for
access pursuant to this Section 6.8 must be directed to the General Counsel
of the Company, or another person designated in writing by the Company.

6.9  _Section_ _ _ _16(b) Exemption_. The Company will take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with
the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the
Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

6.10 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or
former directors, officers or employees (and any person who becomes a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time), on the other hand (collectively, the "Indemnified
Persons"). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation,
bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set
forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational
documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date
of this Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law.

 

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of Section 6.10(a), during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth

 



-77-  anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or pursuant to any
indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in
effect on the date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person from and against
any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
Liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with
any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or
indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Persons capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the
Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition
of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is
alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
insolvent), except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then
the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of
any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right
to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood
that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation
will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons
entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (B) each
Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such
Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one separate
counsel retained by each Indemnified Person and reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of
such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to
control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified
Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected
without his or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor
any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the
termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all Liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding.
Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of
any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will
be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation
(which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the
fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions,
retentions, limits and

 



-78-  amounts) that are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance. In satisfying
its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation
will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount
paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300%
amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium") (which premiums the Company represents
and warrants to be as set forth in Section 6.10(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum
Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a
prepaid "tail" policy with respect to the DandO Insurance from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance carrier so long as the annual
cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the
Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor its obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of
this Section 6.10(c), for so long as such "tail" policy is in full force and
effect.

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns will (i) consolidate with or merge into
any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not
be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section
6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written
consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified
Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance
or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and
representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the
DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their
heirs and representatives)) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational
documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all
indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or in equity).

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section
6.10 will be joint and several.

 

(g) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

 



-79- 6.11 _Employee Matter_ s.

Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all of the Employee Plans and compensation and severance arrangements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any such Employee Plans or
compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or if
otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.

(c) _Employment; Benefits_. As of the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries will continue to employ the employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries will (and the Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to) cause any employee benefit plan, policy, program or
arrangement (including plans, policies, programs or arrangements providing
severance benefits and vacation entitlement) as may be maintained by the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from time to time at or after the
Effective Time for the benefit of one or more Continuing Employee whose terms
and conditions of employment are not, and do not become, subject to a
Collective Bargaining Agreement (each a "Non-Union Employee") to credit such
Non-Union Employees with their service performed for the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time as service with for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accruals, except
to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits and subject
in each case to the terms of such plan. Such service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition limitations.
The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and the Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor all vacation,
personal and sick days accrued by the Business Employees under the Employee
Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent reserved against

will (and the Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to) ensure that the Non-Union Employees and their eligible
spouses, dependents and beneficiaries will receive credit for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs towards deductibles and annual out-of-pocket
limits applicable under any health care plan of the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries covering such persons on or after the Effective Time for
expenses incurred during such plan year by such persons prior to the Effective
Time. As to each current employee of the Company and Continuing Employee
whose terms and

 



-80-  conditions of employment are subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement,
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) comply with the terms and
conditions of each such applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement, in a
manner consistent with applicable Law.

 

(d) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Section 6.11 will not be deemed to
(i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any
Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, policy, program or
arrangement or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights
in any Person.

6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either of
them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements
and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied
at the Closing, except that no such notification will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this

consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to
any information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.13(a).

-81-  Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only
to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) to fail to
be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such notification will affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub

reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Parties before (a)
participating in any media interviews; (b) engaging in any meetings or calls
with analysts, institutional investors or other similar Persons; or (c)
providing any statements that are public or are reasonably likely to become

Litigation. The Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement
regarding, or agree to compromise or settle, any Transaction Litigation
unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this Section
6.15, "participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed
strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction
Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege
between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected),
and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction
Litigation but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other
authority over such Transaction Litigation except for the settlement
or compromise consent set forth above.

the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

6.20 _N_ _o Control of the Other Party_ __ _s Business_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are
not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the

to acquire any assets if such business materially competes in any line of
business of the Company or its Subsidiaries and the entering into of a

merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to impose any delay in

Authority necessary to consummate the Merger or the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting period.

6.22 _Title Commitments, Title Policies and Zoning Letters_. The Company will

the Merger on the date required pursuant to Section 2.3 and, as of such date,

Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates of any provisions of the
Financing Documents; (iii) pursuant to Section 8.1(i) for Parent or Merger

results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section
8.3(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set
forth in Section 8.3(c) or any portion thereof, as applicable, the Company
will pay to Parent or Parent will pay to the Company, as the case may be, its

9.3 _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Parties, except that Parent and Merger Sub will have the
right to assign all or any portion of their respective rights and obligations
pursuant to this Agreement from and after the Effective Time (a) to any
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, (b) in connection with a
merger or consolidation involving Parent or Merger Sub or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the assets of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, or (c) to any Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Financing for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise
assigning as collateral in

 



-94-  respect of the Debt Financing, it being understood that, in the case of each
of (a), (b) and (c), such assignment will not (i) affect the obligations of
the parties (including Financing Sources) to the Financing Letters or
Guarantor pursuant to the Guaranty; or (ii) impede or delay the consummation
of the Merger or otherwise materially impede the rights of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company
Options pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by
any Party, including pursuant to the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), will
relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder and, with respect to
any assignment pursuant to the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), concurrent with
any such assignment, such Subsidiary or other assignee shall become a
guaranteed party under the Guaranty.

9.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that J.F. Lehman and Company and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Letter Agreement, dated October 14, 2015 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), that will continue in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives
will hold and treat all documents and information concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Representatives in connection with the Merger in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be
bound by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if
they were parties thereto.

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Guaranty and the Financing Letters, constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be
superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in
full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the
date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its
terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in this Section 9.6, the
Parties agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants
set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is
not intended to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by Section
6.10, (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company
Options to receive the merger consideration set forth in Article II, and (c)
the Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of, and
shall be entitled to rely on and enforce directly, Section 8.2(b), Section
8.4, Section 9.8(b), Section 9.8(c), Section 9.10(b), Section 9.11 and this
Section 9.6.

 



-95- 9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by Law or
equity upon such Party and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages (including the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee), under no circumstances will the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary
damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and
all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee).

 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any
Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that,
subject to Section 9.8(b)(ii), (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including the respective
obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger;
(B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement,
and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any
Partys right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement.

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 9.8(b)(i), it is acknowledged and agreed that
the right of the Company to an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable remedy in connection with enforcing Parents obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger will be subject to
the requirements that (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing); (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or the
Financing Sources have confirmed in writing that it will be funded at the
Closing; (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing in accordance
with

 



-96-  Section 2.3; and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then it will take such actions that are required
of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event will the
Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate the
Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the
Closing). In no event shall the Company be entitled to specifically enforce
the terms of this Agreement other than solely under the
specific circumstances and as specifically set forth in Section 9.8(b)(i) and
this Section 9.8(b)(ii). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
Company be entitled to a remedy of specific performance or other equitable
remedies against any Financing Source. In no event shall the exercise of the
Companys right to seek specific performance or other equitable remedy
pursuant to this Section 9.8(b)(ii) prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII limit the Companys right, in the event
the Company is unable for any reason to obtain specific performance, to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and to require payment of
the Parent Termination Fee if entitled to payment of the foregoing under
Section 8.3(c); _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (x) a
grant of specific performance that causes the Merger to be consummated and
results in the Closing and (y) any Parent Termination Fee.

(iii) The Parties agree that, except as otherwise set forth in this Section
9.8(b)(iii), in the event that specific performance or other equitable remedy
is available to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including
pursuant to Section 9.8(b)(ii), it shall be the Companys primary remedy
in connection with this Agreement with respect to breaches by Parent or
Merger Sub of the obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Merger. If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to
specifically enforce the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific performance in connection with
this Agreement, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII and to require payment of the Parent Termination Fee if entitled to
payment of the foregoing under Section 8.3(c).

(iv) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.8(b)(ii), the Parties
agree not to raise any objections to the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand on the basis that the other
Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Any Party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that
it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond
or other security.

(v) If prior to the Termination Date any Party initiates a Legal Proceeding
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, then the Termination
Date will be automatically extended by (A) the amount of time during which
such Legal Proceeding is pending plus 20 Business Days; or (B) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such Legal Proceeding.

 



-97- (c) _No Recourse._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII,
the Company, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, agrees that none of the
Financing Sources or their respective Affiliates and Representatives shall
have any Liability or obligation to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination or validity
thereof or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Debt
Financing and the Debt Commitment Letters or any guarantee or the performance
thereof).

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Law thereof.

 

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the
service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or
outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal
Proceeding relating to the Merger and the Guaranty, for and on behalf of
itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or
in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in
this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in
any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom
within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal
court within the State of Delaware) (the "Chosen Courts") in the event that
any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Guaranty or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding
arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought, tried and determined only in
the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such
Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead
or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any
Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any
Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party hereby agrees that (i) it will
not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, bring or support any Legal
Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source or any of its
Affiliates or representatives arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the breach, termination or validity thereof or any transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters
or the performance thereof) in any forum other than a court of competent
jurisdiction located within the County of New York, State of New York,
whether a state or Federal court and (ii) Section 9.11 shall apply to any such
Legal Proceeding.

 



-98- 9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR THE GUARANTY. EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER;
(ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii)
IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

 

9.12 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the
corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only
to the extent that the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure.

 

9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic
Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature,
or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

9.14 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent
possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and
closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and
that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this

 



-99-  Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing
set forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the
scope, applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.

[ _Signature page follows_.]

 



-100- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed and
delivered by their respective duly authorized officers as of the date first
written above.
