Capitalized terms that are used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined
shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in _Article IX_.

 

RECITALS:

 

WHEREAS, the Company Board, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a
committee of the Company Board consisting only of independent directors of
the Company (the " _Transaction Committee_ "), has unanimously (i) approved,
and declared advisable, this Agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, (ii) approved the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by
the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder and the
consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company
Stockholders adopt this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; and

WHEREAS, each of the board of managers of Parent and the board of directors
of Merger Sub have (i) approved, and declared advisable, this Agreement
providing for the Merger, and (ii) approved the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, performance of their respective covenants and other obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent, as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will act by written consent to adopt this
Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Avista Capital Partners, L.P. and Avista Capital Partners (Offshore), L.P.
(the " _Guarantors_ ") have entered into a guarantee, dated as of the date
hereof and in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Guarantee_ "),
in favor of the Company with respect to the obligations and liabilities of
Parent and Merger Sub arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
the Guarantee.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

 



4 ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. At
the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger. The Company, in its capacity as the
surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Corporation_."

1.2 _The Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated under the DGCL by filing with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary
of State_ ") a certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the
time of such filing with the Delaware Secretary of State, or such later time
as may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, being referred to herein as the "
_Effective Time_ "). 

1.3 _The Closing_. The consummation of the Merger shall take place at a
closing (the " _Closing_ ") to occur at the offices of Hogan Lovells US LLP,
Columbia Square, 555 Thirteenth Street, Washington, DC, 20004, at 10:00 a.m.
(New York Time) on the third (3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted hereunder), of those conditions at such time), or at such
other location, date and time as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
mutually agree upon in writing; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the
satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions described in _Article VI_ ,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to effect the Closing until the
earlier of (a) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on at
least three (3) Business Days notice to the Company and (b) the first Business
Day following the final day of the Marketing Period. The date upon which the
Closing shall actually occur pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_."

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the effects of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



5 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_, the certificate of incorporation of the
Company (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") shall be amended as of the
Effective Time to read in its entirety in the form of the certificate of
incorporation attached hereto as Exhibit B, and, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such
certificate of incorporation.

 

(b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of _Section
5.10(a)_, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended as of the Effective Time
to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and, as so amended, shall become the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation (except that, for the avoidance of doubt, the name of
the Surviving Corporation shall be Kingston Merger Sub, Inc.) until thereafter
amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 

1.6 _Directors and Officers_.

(a) _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately
after the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their earlier death, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. 

(b) _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their earlier
death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
appointed, as the case may be.

1.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the securities of the Company or Merger Sub, the following shall occur:

 

(i) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and
Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be cancelled, extinguished and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $19.75 (the "
_Per Share Price_ "), without interest thereon; and

 

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is held by the Company or owned
by Parent or Merger Sub, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent or Merger Sub, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time

 



6  (" _Owned Company Shares_ "), shall automatically be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefore;
and

 

(iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and
thereupon each certificate representing ownership of such shares of
common stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter represent ownership of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Adjustment to Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend or distribution (including any dividend or other distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock, but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the granting or other issuance of Company Options in
accordance with this Agreement), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time, in each case which is effected in accordance with
or otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 

(c) _Dissenting Shares_.

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, subject
to _Section 1.7(c)(ii)_, any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder
who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively
withdrawn or lost or failed to perfect such appraisal rights (" _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the
Per Share Price pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_, but instead shall be converted
into the right to receive only such consideration as may be determined to be
due with respect to such Dissenting Shares under the DGCL. Parent shall be
entitled to utilize any funds deposited into the Exchange Fund with respect to
Dissenting Shares for purposes of paying the consideration payable with
respect to such Dissenting Shares. From and after the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL, and a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any
of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving
Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.7(c)(i)_, if any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal for such shares in
accordance with the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then such holders shares
shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted
into and represent only the right to receive the Per Share Price as set forth
in _Section 1.7(a)_, without any interest thereon.

(iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal rights of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of
such 

 



7  demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by the Company which relate to any such demand for appraisal rights and (B)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings which take
place prior to the Effective Time with respect to demands for appraisal rights
under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal rights
of Company Common Stock, offer to settle or settle any such demands, waive any
failure to demand that the Company purchase the shares for cash at the fair
market value thereof or any failure to perfect such right, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

(d) _Company Stock-based Awards; Warrants_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock granted subject
to vesting or other lapse restrictions under any Company Stock Plan (each, a
" _Company Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall vest in full and become free of such restrictions as of
the Effective Time and, at the Effective Time, shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Price in accordance with _Section 1.7(a)_ and
under the same terms and conditions as apply to the receipt of the Per Share
Price by holders of Company Common Stock generally. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to holders of Company Restricted
Shares such consideration less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payments as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time. 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding unexpired or unexercised
Company Option, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled, and (A) in the
case of any Company Option having a per share exercise price less than the Per
Share Price, be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation, for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (y) the amount by which the Per Share Price
exceeds the per share exercise price of such Company Option (such product, the
" _Option Consideration_ "), or (B) in the case of any Company Option having
a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, no
cash shall be paid or payable nor other securities issued in respect thereof.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to holders of
Company Options the Option Consideration, without interest thereon, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payments
pursuant to this _Section 1.7(d)_, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time.

 

(iii) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding unexpired or unexercised
Company Warrant shall be converted into the right to receive for each share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to
the Effective Time, an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in
cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(y) the amount by which the Per Share Price exceeds the per share exercise
price of such Company Warrant (the " _Warrant Consideration_ ");  _provided_
that in the case of any Company Warrant having a per share exercise price
equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Company

 



8  Warrant shall be cancelled and no cash shall be paid or payable nor other
securities issued in respect thereof. Parent shall, or shall cause the Company
to, pay to applicable holders of Company Warrants the Warrant Consideration,
without interest thereon, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payments pursuant to this _Section 1.7(d)_, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. To the extent
permissible pursuant to the terms of such Company Warrant, each then
outstanding Company Warrant shall be cancelled at the Effective Time. To the
extent such cancellation is not permissible pursuant to the terms of such
Company Warrant, such Company Warrant shall remain outstanding pursuant to
its terms; _provided_ that any holder of such Company Warrants shall cease to
have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Warrant
Consideration payable therefor pursuant to this _Section 1.7(d)_.

(iv) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take such actions (other than the payment of additional
consideration) as may be necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 1.7(d)_, including by delivering to the holders
of Company Restricted Shares, the holders of Company Options and the holders
of Company Warrants notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, setting forth such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement.

 

1.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Payment Agent_. No less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the mailing
of the Proxy Statement, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the "
_Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent in a separate fund,
for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article I_ , an amount of cash equal to the aggregate
consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled under
this _Article I_ (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, payments to which
holders of Company Options and holders of Company Warrants become
entitled, which Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, in accordance with
_Section 1.7(d)_), assuming there are no Dissenting Shares. Until disbursed
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not permit such cash to be invested by the
Payment Agent (such cash being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any income from investment of
the Exchange Fund, which shall be in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, will be payable to the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event more than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (the
" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") (A) a letter of

 



9  transmittal in such form and having such provisions as the Company and
Parent may reasonably specify (and which shall specify, in the case of
tendered Certificates, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or appropriate affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Payment Agent),
and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or appropriate affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article I_. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent in accordance with the terms hereof,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Payment Agent, the holders of record of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, by (y) the Per
Share Price (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of
such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
holders transferred Uncertificated Shares, by (y) the Per Share Price (less
any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of
such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section 1.8_.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right
to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article I_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name
other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered
in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of
the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate (if applicable) is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form
for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) or the Surviving Corporation any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share
Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares, or established to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other
Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

 



10 (e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Shares, Company Options and
Company Warrants or any other Person such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state, local or non-U.S.
Tax laws. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, assist Parent
in making such deductions and withholding as reasonably requested by Parent.
To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to the Surviving Corporation_. Any portion
of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is eighteen (18) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at the request of Parent, to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 1.8_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares solely to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws), as general creditors thereof, for any claim to
the applicable Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article I_.

1.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of Uncertificated Shares or a Certificate theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, without interest
thereon, the Per Share Price payable therefor in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 1.7_ (or otherwise, in respect of Dissenting Shares,
the right to receive consideration in accordance with _Section 1.7(c)_). The
Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_.

1.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, 

 



11  stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.7_;
_provided, however,_ that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require such
Person to provide an indemnity and/or bond against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
such Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

1.11 Necessary Further Actions . If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause
their respective directors and officers to take all such lawful and necessary
action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

3.10 _Financing_.

(a) The aggregate amount of funds contemplated to be provided pursuant to the

required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Merger and the Financing; and (iii) satisfy all of the

complete copy of (i) the executed commitment letter (the " _Equity Financing
Letter_ "), dated as of the date hereof, among Parent, Merger Sub and the
other parties thereto (collectively, the " _Equity Financing Sources_ "),
pursuant to which the Equity Financing Sources have committed, subject to the
terms thereof, to invest the cash amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ ") and (ii) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
hereof, from Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada, RBC Capital Markets, SunTrust Bank,
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi-UFJ, Ltd.
(the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Financing
Letter, the " _Financing Letters_ "), pursuant to which the lenders party
thereto have committed, subject to the terms thereof, to lend the amounts set
forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ " (which term shall include, if

as contemplated under the Debt Commitment Letter) and, together with the
Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "). Parent has also delivered to
the Company a true, complete and correct copy of any fee letter in connection

34 (c) As of the date hereof, the Financing Letters have not been amended or
modified and none of the respective obligations and commitments contained in
the Financing Letters have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The
Financing Letters, in the form so delivered to the Company on the date hereof,
are in full force and effect as of the date hereof. The Financing Letters are
(i) legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as
applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto
and (ii) enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against Parent
and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the
other parties thereto, in each case except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally. The
Financing Letters and the Fee Letter contain all of the conditions precedent
to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available
to Parent on the terms therein and there are no other conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, or to the Knowledge of Parent,
any other parties thereto, under the Financing Letters or that makes any of
the assumptions or statements set forth in the Financing Letters inaccurate in
any material respect. As of the date hereof, and subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ and the performance by the
Company of its obligations under this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
contemplated in the Financing Letters will not be satisfied or that
the Financing will not be made available to Parent and Merger Sub at or prior
to the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be
fully paid, any and all commitment or other fees which are due and payable on
or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters.
Other than the Fee Letter and as set forth in _Schedule 3.10(c)_ , there are
no side letters or other Contracts to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is
a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Letters.

(d) As of the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates is a party to any Contracts, or any commitment to enter
into any Contracts, with any Person (including any Company Stockholder,
director, officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries) concerning
any investments to be made in, or contributions to be made to, Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and/or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than as set forth in the Financing
Letters.

(e) As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has (i) retained any
financial advisor on a basis exclusive to Parent or Merger Sub other than
advisors to which the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) has
previously consented or (ii) entered into an exclusivity, lock-up or other
similar agreement, arrangement or binding understanding with any bank or
investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing that
explicitly prohibits such provider from providing or seeking to provide such
financing or financial advisory services to any third party in connection
with a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (including in
connection with the making of any Alternative

 



35  Transaction Proposal), in the case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has caused or induced any Person to
take any action that, if taken by Parent or Merger Sub, would be a breach of,
or would cause to be untrue, any of the representations in this _Section
3.10(e)_.

 

3.11 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement the Guarantors have delivered to the Company the Guarantee, duly
executed by the Guarantors, in favor of the Company with respect to the
performance by Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, of their respective
obligations under this Agreement. The Guarantee is in full force and effect
and is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantors, except
as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally, and no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the
Guarantors under the Guarantee.

3.12 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date hereof, except as
previously disclosed to the Company Board, there are no Contracts or any
commitments to enter into any Contracts (a) between Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any director, officer or
employee of the Company, on the other hand, relating to this Agreement, to the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including as
to any investments to be made in, or contributions to be made to, Parent or
Merger Sub), or to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective businesses or operations (including as to continuing
employment) from and after the Closing or (b) pursuant to which any Company
Stockholder would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount
or nature than the Per Share Price in respect of its shares of Company
Common Stock or pursuant to which any Company Stockholder agrees to vote to
adopt this Agreement or the Merger, or agrees to vote against any Superior
Proposal.

3.13 _Solvency_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ , and assuming (a) the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement as of the
Closing, (b) the performance in all material respects by the Company of its
obligations hereunder, and (c) that the estimates, projections and forecasts
provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared
in good faith based on assumptions that are, and continue to be, reasonable,
as of the Effective Time and immediately after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, the
payment of the aggregate Per Share Price, any repayment or refinancing of
Indebtedness contemplated by this Agreement, the Financing Letters or any
Company Indebtedness, the payment of all fees and expenses required to be paid
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the Financing, and the payment of all other
obligations of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries contemplated hereunder, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable
value" of the assets of each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as of such date will exceed each of (i) the value of all
"liabilities of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and such Subsidiaries,
including contingent and other liabilities" as of such date (with the quoted
text in this clause (a) generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors), and (ii)
the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and such Subsidiaries on their existing

 



36  debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and
matured; (b) each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
will not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of
the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged; and (c) each
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be able to pay
its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.
For purposes of the foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed
to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to
generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. 

3.14 _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge and agree that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in _Article II_ , (a) neither the Company, nor
any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, nor any
other Person, has made or is making any other express or implied
representation or warranty, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations,
including with respect to any information provided or made available to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, or any
other Person, and all representations and warranties other than those

Sub, (b) except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, nor or any of their respective Affiliates,

indemnification obligation or other obligation of any kind or nature
to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, or any
other Person, resulting from the delivery, dissemination or any other
distribution to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or
advisors, or any other Person, or the use by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, representatives or advisors, or any other Person, of any such
information provided or made available to any of them by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or
advisors, or any other Person, including any information, documents,
estimates, projections, forecasts or other forward-looking information,
business plans or other material provided or made available to Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives or advisors, or any other Person, in "data

the Company and its Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, representatives and advisors certain estimates, projections, forecasts
and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business
plan information, regarding the Company and its business and operations.
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, and that
Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, or any other

to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries at any
time prior to the Effective Time, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, no consent of Parent or Merger Sub will be
required with

 



41  respect to any matter set forth in this Agreement to the extent the
requirement of such consent would violate any applicable law. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall exercise (consistent
with and subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement)
control and supervision over their own business and operations.

4.3 _No Solicitation_.

(a) _No Solicitation_. The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, authorize or permit any of its officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
agents or other representatives retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly, or indirectly, (i) solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing any non-public information to any Person) any
inquiries with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, or
the making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative Transaction
Proposal, (ii) continue or engage in any discussions or negotiations
concerning, knowingly assist or knowingly furnish to any Person (other than
the parties to this Agreement and their representatives) any information with
respect to, any possible Alternative Transaction Proposal, or afford access to

the purpose of knowingly facilitating or encouraging an Alternative
Transaction Proposal (except to disclose the existence of the provisions of
this _Section 4.3_ and as permitted in _Section 4.3(f)_), (iii) (A) fail to
make, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent (except to the
extent specifically permitted pursuant to _Section 4.3(d)_) or (B) within
five (5) Business Days following a request therefor by Parent, fail to

or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any
Alternative Transaction (except to the extent specifically permitted pursuant
to _Section 4.3(d)_) (any of the actions referred to in the foregoing
_clauses (iii)_ or _(iv)_ , whether taken by the Companys Board of
Directors or a committee thereof, a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_
"), (v) approve or enter into or negotiate any letter of intent, agreement in
principle or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment
(whether binding or not) contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement that the Company is permitted to enter into under  _Section
4.3(c)_, (vi) take any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent or its
Subsidiaries) or any action taken by such Person from any state takeover

as provided in _Section 5.5_ with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, amend, take any action with
respect to, or make any determination under the Rights Agreement (including a
redemption of the Rights) to facilitate an Alternative Transaction Proposal.
The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease, and shall cause
their respective officers, directors and employees to cease and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant, agent or other representative retained by them to cease,
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction
Proposal. The Company agrees that in the event any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant, agent or other representative
retained by the Company or its Subsidiaries takes any action which, if taken
by the Company, would constitute a material breach of this _Section 4.3(a)_,
then the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this Section 4.3(a) for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 



42 (b) _Notification of Alternative Transaction Proposals_. As promptly as
practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after receipt of
any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for non-public information
or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative
Transaction Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with oral and written
notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction
Proposal, request or inquiry, summaries of the material contents of any
material oral communications relating to such Alternative Transaction
Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry
and a copy of all written materials provided to it in connection with
such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition, the
Company shall provide Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) with written notice setting forth such
information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed in all
material respects of all material communications regarding, and the status and
material details (including material amendments or proposed material
amendments) of, any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or
inquiry, and, without limitation of the other provisions of this _Section
4.3_, shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written materials
(including written materials provided by email or otherwise in
electronic format) subsequently provided by it in connection with such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall not
enter into any agreement (or amend or modify any agreement) with any Person or
group of Persons which would prevent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, agent or
other representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries from complying
with the provisions of this  _Section 4.3_.

(c) _Permitted Actions in Connection with Certain Alternative Transaction
Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
4.3(a)_, in the event that, prior to the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction
Proposal which the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel to be, or, in the good faith determination of the
Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof), would be reasonably
likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, it may then, after providing prompt
written notice to Parent, take the following actions (but only if and to the
extent that the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) concludes
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal advisors) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law):

 

(i) Furnish non-public information to the Person or group of Persons making
such Alternative Transaction Proposal; provided that (A) prior to furnishing
any such non-public information, the Company receives from such Person or
group of Persons an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such non-public information to
such Person or group of Persons, the Company makes available such non-public
information to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been
previously so made available to Parent); and

 



43 (ii) Engage in discussions and negotiations with such Person or group of
Persons with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

(d) _Change of Recommendation; Termination_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or
any authorized committee thereof) shall be permitted, if, but only if, it
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal advisors) that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, to (A) make a Company Board Recommendation Change referenced
in _clause (iii)_ of _Section 4.3(a)_ or (B), following receipt of a bona
fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal that is determined in good
faith by the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal advisors) to be a
Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_;
_provided_ that prior to the effectiveness of any such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, (X) the Company shall have given Parent
and Merger Sub prompt written notice advising them, as applicable, of (1) the
decision of the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) to take
such action and the reasons therefor and (2) in the event the decision relates
to a Superior Proposal, a notice that the Company will terminate this
Agreement on the last day of the Notice Period and a summary of the material
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and other information required
to be provided with respect thereto pursuant to this  _Section 4.3_,
including the information required to be provided pursuant to _Sections
4.3(b)_ and _4.3(c)_ , (Y) the Company shall have given Parent and Merger Sub
three (3) Business Days after delivery of such notice (the " _Notice Period_
") to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another
proposal) and, during the Notice Period, the Company shall, and shall direct
its financial advisors and outside legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent
in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, if
applicable, such Alternative Transaction Proposal ceases to constitute (in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board (or any authorized committee
thereof), after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
advisors), a Superior Proposal or, if the Company Board Recommendation Change
does not involve an Alternative Transaction Proposal, to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the failure
to make such Company Board Recommendation Change (in the good faith judgment
of the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof), after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal advisors) would not
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (Z) the
Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) in its good faith
judgment shall have determined after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel and, after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent and Merger Sub,
if any, that (I) in the case of an Alternative Transaction Proposal, that it
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ and enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law or (II) in the case of a Company Board
Recommendation Change referenced in _clause (iii)_ of _Section 4.3(a)_, that
the failure to make such Company Board Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if, during the Notice Period, any

 



44  material revisions are made to the Superior Proposal or there is any
material change with respect to the determination under _Section
4.3(d)(i)(A)_, the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and
shall comply with the requirements of this _Section 4.3(d)_ with respect to
such new written notice except that the new Notice Period shall be forty eight
(48) hours (provided that if such forty eight (48) hour period would end on a
day other than a Business Day, then such period shall be extended to the close
of business on the next Business Day) instead of three (3) Business Days.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding any Company Board Recommendation Change by the Company,
unless such Company Board Recommendation Change is with respect to an
Alternative Transaction Proposal and the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(h), the Company shall cause the adoption of this
Agreement to be submitted to a vote of the Company Stockholders at a meeting
of Company Stockholders, and, without the prior written consent of Parent,
the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedure matters
related thereto and any required advisory votes related to executive
compensation payable in connection with the Merger) which the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the Company Stockholders at such Company Stockholder
Meeting.

 

(e) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules; Disclosure to Stockholders_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board
from (x) taking and disclosing to their stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in each case, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof)
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal advisor)
failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law; _provided_ that in each case the Company shall not fail
to make, withdraw, modify or change the Company Board Recommendation unless
specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of _Section 4.3(d)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 4.3_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, if the Company receives a written Alternative
Transaction Proposal from any third Person, the Company and/or its
Representatives may contact such third Person in writing solely for the
purpose of clarifying the Alternative Transaction Proposal.

limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub (and
their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, shall (i) file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of
the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the

practical, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the

notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental
Authority that are required by other applicable Antitrust Laws or investment

(or sooner if due sooner), as listed on _Schedule 5.2(a)(ii)_ hereof. Parent
and Merger Sub shall be responsible for paying all filing fees in connection
with the foregoing filings with Governmental Authorities (other than filing

Merger Sub and 50% by the Company). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and except for filings required from each party under the HSR
Act, the parties agree that Parent shall make (with the reasonable cooperation
of the Company) all pre-merger and post-merger notification filings, forms and
submissions with any Governmental Authority that are required by applicable
Antitrust Laws or investment act laws.

(b) The reasonable best efforts of each of Parent and the Company shall
include (i) reasonably cooperating and coordinating with the other in the
making of such filings; (ii) promptly supplying the other with any information
that may be required in order to make such filings; (iii) subject to the

all action necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other law applicable to the Merger
as soon as practicable, and to obtain any required consents under any other
law applicable to the Merger as soon as reasonably practicable. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly inform the other of
any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with such filings.
If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to
the HSR Act or any other law applicable to the Merger with respect to which
any such filings have been made, then such party shall make (or cause to be
made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall provide to the
other (or the others respective advisors) upon request copies of all
correspondence between such party and any Governmental Authority,
or production made by any such party to any Governmental Authority, relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties may, as they
deem advisable and

 



47  necessary, designate any competitively or commercially sensitive materials
provided to the other under this _Section 5.2_ as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In addition,
to the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and
meetings with a Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall include representatives of all of the parties.

(c) In the event that a Governmental Authority issues a request for additional
information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law (the " _Second Request_ ") in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then Parent and Merger Sub, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall make (or cause to be
made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other, an appropriate response in compliance with the Second Request in order
to obtain expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period before
the Termination Date. For the avoidance of doubt, whether or not the
transactions contemplated herein are consummated, Parent and Merger Sub shall
pay all out-of-pocket fees and expenses related to the Companys response to
a Second Request (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses, and
fees and expenses associated with any consultants, accountants, economists,
document production vendors, or other professionals hired to help the
Company respond to the Second Request), _provided_ that the obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub to pay such fees and expenses related to actions taken
by the Company shall be conditioned upon Parent and Merger Sub not providing
written reasonable objections prior to the Company incurring such fees and
expenses. Parent and Merger Sub shall either pay such costs and expenses
directly or reimburse the Company, as applicable, within thirty (30) days
after receipt of an invoice (with reasonable supporting documentation) for
the same.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall respond
to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any objections
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly take, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement before the Termination Date, all actions necessary to (i) secure the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
or any other applicable law and (ii) resolve any objections asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement raised by any
Governmental Authority, and to prevent the entry of any court order and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict, or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (A)
executing settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations, or other
agreements with any Governmental Authority (or with any private party, but
only in this later case, in order to vacate, lift, reverse, overturn, settle,
or otherwise resolve any decree, judgment, injunction, or other order that
prevents, prohibits, restricts, or delays the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that may be issued by any court or other
Governmental Authority in favor of that third party), (B) selling, divesting,
holding separate, licensing, or otherwise conveying particular securities or
equity interests, assets or categories of assets or businesses of Parent or
Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or ultimate parent entities or the
Company or its Subsidiaries, (C) agreeing to any conduct provisions or
agreeing to sell, divest, hold separate, license, or otherwise convey

 



48  any particular securities, equity interests, or assets or categories of
assets or businesses of Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or
ultimate parent entities or the Company or its Subsidiaries contemporaneously
with or subsequent to the Closing, and (D) permitting the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to sell, divest, license, or otherwise convey any particular
assets or categories of assets or businesses of any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall not be required to take any action or reach any agreement
that would be materially adverse to the business or financial condition of
Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company post-closing and taken as a whole. No
actions taken pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall be considered for purposes
of determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

 

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and ultimate parent entities and their Subsidiaries not to,
acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or
by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner,
any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets or equity interests, if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation
would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Authority seeking or entering an order prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii)
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise; or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

5.3 _Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file
with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement for use in connection with the
solicitation of proxies from the Company Stockholders for use at the Company
Stockholder Meeting within twenty (20) calendar days after the date hereof or
such earlier date as is reasonably practicable. If the Company determines that
it is required to file with the SEC any Other Required Company Filing under
applicable law, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such Other
Required Company Filing as promptly as reasonably practicable after making
such determination. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing to comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of
the SEC and NASDAQ. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable) as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or
any of their respective partners, members, stockholders, directors, officers
or other Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, so
that the Proxy Statement or Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be,
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary 

 



49  to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement or the applicable Other Required Company Filing
describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed by the
Company with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable law or the SEC
or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

(b) The Company, after consultation with Parent (and including comments
reasonably proposed by Parent), will use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments made by the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable law, the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated
to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing
thereof with the SEC and after confirmation from the SEC or its staff that it
will not comment on, or that it has no additional comments on, or the
expiration of any waiting period with respect to, the Proxy Statement or any
Other Required Company Filing and, if necessary in order to comply with
applicable securities laws, after the Proxy Statement shall have been so
mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy
material, and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies.

(c)(i) The Company and its Affiliates shall not file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement or any Other Required Company Filing or any amendment or supplement
thereto, and (ii) the Company and its Affiliates shall not correspond or
otherwise communicate with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement or any Other Required Company Filing in any such case referenced in
the preceding _clause (i)_ or  _(ii)_ without providing Parent and Merger
Sub a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

(d) The Company shall advise Parent and Merger Sub, promptly after the
Company receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its
staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing, any receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on
the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, or any receipt of a
request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection
therewith.

 

(e) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change in accordance with the terms of  _Section 4.3_, the
Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
and, if applicable, any Other Required Company Filings.

5.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

(a) Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ , the
Company will take, in accordance with applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation, the bylaws of the Company and the rules of the SEC and NASDAQ,
all reasonable action necessary to schedule a meeting of the Company
Stockholders (or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company
Stockholder Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable following
dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders for the
purpose of voting to adopt this Agreement in accordance with the

 



50  DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written consent of
Parent, the Company shall not initially schedule the Company Stockholder
Meeting later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date on which the
Proxy Statement is mailed to the Companys stockholders; _provided, further,_
nothing herein shall prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the
Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) Parent has consented to such postponement
or adjournment; (ii) there are holders of insufficient shares of the Company
Common Stock present or represented by a proxy at the Company Stockholder
Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting; (iii) the
Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by
applicable law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff; or (iv) the
Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) shall have determined in
good faith that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting, including in order to (A) give Company
Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that
the Company has sent (or needs to send) to Company Stockholders or otherwise
made available to Company Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing
materials with the SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any
Company Board Recommendation Change), or (B) enable the additional time to
solicit proxies from Company Stockholders; _provided_ , that, unless otherwise
required by applicable law in order to provide additional disclosure to the
Company Stockholders, the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof)
shall only be entitled to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting
one time pursuant to this _clause iv_ of _Section 5.4(a)_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent may, upon written request, require the Company, solely
for the purpose of enabling additional time to solicit proxies from Company
Stockholders, to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting one time
for a reasonable period of time not to exceed five (5) Business Days.

(b) Once the Company has established a record date for purposes
of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at the Company
Stockholder Meeting (the " _Record Date_ "), the Company shall not change such
Record Date or establish a different record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless
required to do so by applicable law or there has been a Company Board
Recommendation Change. In the event that the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or
otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise
approved in writing or there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change,
it shall implement such adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a
way that the Company does not establish a new Record Date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required
by applicable law.

 

(c) Subject to _Section 4.3(d)_, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, submit this
Agreement for adoption by the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder
Meeting and cause the Company Stockholder Meeting to be called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted. The Company shall, upon the reasonable
request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting,
as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect
to the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

 



51 (d) Unless there shall have been a Company Board Recommendation Change, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its directors, officers, employees
and other representatives to, make reasonable and customary solicitations and
recommendations to the Company Stockholders for purposes of causing the
Requisite Stockholder Approval to be obtained including, upon Parents
request, (i) presenting materials (in a form reasonably agreed by Parent and
the Company) at a reasonable and customary number of occasions that recommend
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger)
to the Company Stockholders and/or any firm providing proxy advisory services
to the Company Stockholders, and (ii) if necessary, requesting a reasonable
and customary number of meetings with the Company Stockholders (for purposes
of obtaining their recommendation of the adoption of this Agreement) and/or
any firm providing proxy advisory services to the Company Stockholders (for
purposes of obtaining its recommendation of the adoption of this Agreement by
the Company Stockholders).

5.5 _Rights Agreement_. The Company Board shall take all further actions (in
addition to those referred to in _Section 2.31_) reasonably requested by
Parent in order to render the Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) _Equity Financing_.

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
terms and conditions of the Equity Financing Letter, each of Parent and Merger
Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all
actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things, necessary, proper or
advisable to (A) obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity
Financing Letter, (B) maintain in effect the Equity Financing Letter, (C)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub
set forth in the Equity Financing Letter that are within its control, (D)
consummate the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Letter at
or prior to the Closing, and (E) when obligated to do so pursuant to _Section
8.8_, fully enforce the obligations of the Equity Financing Sources (and the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub) under the Equity Financing Letter, including
by filing one or more lawsuits against the Equity Financing Sources to fully
enforce the obligations of the Equity Financing Sources (and the rights of
Parent and Merger Sub) thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_ shall
require, and in no event shall reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub
be deemed to require, Parent or Merger Sub to seek equity financing from any
source other than the Equity Financing Sources, in any amount in excess of,
or on other terms and conditions from, the Equity Financing Letter.

 

(ii) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend, alter, or waive, or agree to
amend, alter or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term
of the Equity Financing Letter without the prior written consent of the
Company (except for any amendment that solely increases the amount of the
Equity Financing without amending or modifying any other term of the
Equity Financing Letter). Parent shall promptly notify the Company of (A) the
expiration or termination (or attempted or purported termination, whether or
not valid) of the

 



52  Equity Financing Letter, or (B) any refusal by any Equity Financing Source
to provide or any stated intent by any Equity Financing Source to refuse to
provide the full financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Letter.

(b) _Debt Financing_.

 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including any "market flex" terms therein or in the Fee Letter, and
after taking into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period),
(B) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and negotiate definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" terms therein or in the Fee Letter), (C) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub set forth in such
definitive agreements that are within their reasonable control, and (D) comply
with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter, and (E) upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter at
the Closing. In the event that all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter
(other than the availability of funding of any of the Equity Financing) have
been satisfied or upon funding will be satisfied, and the Closing is required
to occur pursuant to _Section 1.3_, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such lenders and the other Persons
providing such Debt Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter.

(ii) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend, alter, or waive, or agree to
amend, alter or waive (in any case, whether by action or inaction), any term
of the Debt Commitment Letter or any provision of the Fee Letter (to the
extent any such amendment, alteration, or waiver would reasonably be expected
to delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date)
without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, alteration
or waiver reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless such
reduction is matched with a corresponding equivalent increase of the amount of
the equity financing contemplated in the Equity Financing Letter or
Alternative Debt Financing (as permitted by, and in accordance with, this
_Section 5.6(b)_) or amends the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing in
a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or make less
likely the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions
to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and Merger Sub may replace and/or amend the Debt Commitment Letter so
long as (A) the terms would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent
the Closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Debt Financing) less likely to occur, (B) the conditions to
the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof would not be expanded in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
delay or prevent the Closing, and (C) such amendment or alternative financing
does not reduce (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount
of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount), unless such reduction is matched with a
corresponding equivalent increase of the amount of the equity financing
contemplated in the Equity Financing Letter; and in any such event, Parent
shall disclose to the

 



53  Company its intention to make any such amendment or obtain such alternative
financing (the " _Alternative Debt Financing_ "), shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of the terms thereof and shall deliver to the Company
final drafts of the commitment letter (the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ")
providing for such alternative financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing set forth in this  _Section 5.6(b)_ shall restrict Parent or Merger
Sub from amending or modifying the Debt Financing Letter solely to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. In
the event that a New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, the term "Debt
Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to mean the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not so superseded at
the time in question and any Alternative Debt Financing contemplated by a New
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and any reference to the
term Debt Commitment Letter shall be deemed to include any Debt
Commitment Letter that is not superseded by the New Debt Commitment Letter at
the time in question and the New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in
effect. Parent shall promptly notify the Company of the expiration or
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter and the New Debt Commitment Letter
(if applicable).

(iii) Upon the Companys request, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and
provide to the Company copies of the material definitive agreements for the
Debt Financing (excluding any provisions related solely to fees or other
economic terms). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (x) of any material breach or
material default by any party to any of the Financing Letters, or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing, in each case of which Parent
or Merger Sub becomes aware, (y) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication, in each case with respect to any (1) actual breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing or (2) material
dispute between or among any parties to any of the Financing Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing or any provisions of any of
the Financing Letters, in each case, with respect to the obligation to fund
the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing and (z)
of the receipt of any notice or other communication (written or verbal)
related to the likely failure by a party to the Financing Letters to fund the
Financing or the reduction of any amount of the Financing; _provided_ , that
none of Parent or Merger Sub shall be required to provide such information if
it would reasonably be expected to (i) result in the loss of the attorney-
client privilege of Parent or Merger Sub, _provided_ , that Parent shall use
its reasonable efforts to provide such information in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to result in the loss of the attorney-client
privilege, or (ii) contravene any law, judgment or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in any event within two (2) Business Days of the date the Company
delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to
any circumstance referred to in _clauses (x)_ , _(y)_ or _(z)_ of the
immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ , that none of Parent or Merger Sub
shall be required to provide such information if it would reasonably be
expected to (i) result in the loss of the attorney-client privilege of Parent
or Merger Sub, _provided_ , that Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to
provide such information in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to
result in the loss of the attorney-client privilege, or (ii) contravene any
law, judgment or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement.

 



54 (iv) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable and such portion
is reasonably required to fund the aggregate Per Share Price, Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event, Alternative Debt Financing from the same or
alternative sources in an amount, when added to the portion of the Debt
Financing that is available, sufficient to fund the aggregate Per Share Price
and make the other payments referred to in  _Section 3.10(a)_ and which
would not otherwise reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or delay the
Effective Time or the date on which the Financing would be obtained, or (y)
make the funding of the Financing less likely in any material respect.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
in this _Section 5.6_ shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable
best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require,
Parent or Merger Sub to (A) seek or incur Alternative Debt Financing if any
term thereof is outside of, or less favorable than, any applicable economic
provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or any related fee letter (including
any "market flex" provision contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or any
related fee letter), (B) seek any Alternative Debt Financing on any other
terms which are otherwise materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent and Merger Sub than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
which the New Debt Commitment Letter is replacing or (C) pay any fees or other
compensation in any form in excess of those contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter (whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained therein or otherwise). Parent shall deliver to the
Company true and complete copies of all Contracts pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt
Financing other than fee and engagement letters in respect of the Financing
(provided, that Parent shall provide such fee letters redacted in a form
reasonably satisfactory to such alternative sources).

 

(v) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide (and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to
provide), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives, including legal and accounting Representatives, to provide,
in each case, at Parents sole expense (in accordance with the reimbursement
provisions below), such cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or Merger
Sub and that is customarily provided in connection with arranging and
obtaining the Financing or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or
alternative financing. Such cooperation shall include using reasonable best
efforts to:

(A) furnish Parent and Merger Sub and their financing sources as promptly as
practicable with (I) (x) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company
and related statements of income, changes in equity and cash flows of for the
three (3) most recently completed fiscal years ended at least ninety (90) days
prior to the Closing Date and (y) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and
related statements of income and cash flows of the Company for each fiscal
quarter ending after December 31, 2011 and ending at least forty-five (45)
days prior to the Closing Date, which financial statements shall include a
comparison to the same quarterly period for the prior year (to the extent
available), and in the case of the financial statements referred to in clause
(x) and (y) shall be prepared (1) in compliance in all material respects with

 



55  all applicable requirements of Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act for offerings of debt securities on a registration statement on
Form S-1 and (2) in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and in a
manner that fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial condition, results of operations, changes in equity and cash flows
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of and for the periods then ended,
subject to normal year end adjustments and the absence of footnotes, and shall
not be materially inconsistent with the financial statement or forecasts of
the Company previously provided by the Company, and (II) all other
financial statements, pro forma financial information, financial data, audit
reports and other information regarding the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be required under the Debt Commitment Letter or reasonably
required by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing or incorporated in
any offering document used to syndicate credit facilities of the type to be
included in the Debt Financing or in connection with the offering of non-
convertible high-yield bonds under Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities
Act, in each case assuming that such syndication of credit facilities or
offerings of bonds were consummated at the same time during the Companys
fiscal year as such syndication or offerings, including of the type that
would be required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under the
Securities Act for a registered public offering of non-convertible debt
securities of the Parent (including for Parents preparation of pro forma
financial statements), to the extent the same is of the type and form
customarily included in an offering memorandum for private placements of non-
convertible high-yield bonds under Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities
Act (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any financial
statements required by Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 or 3-16 or any Compensation,
Discussion and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b)), or otherwise
necessary to receive from the Companys independent accountants customary
"comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort) with respect to the
financial information to be included in such offering memorandum and which,
with respect to any interim financial statements, shall have been reviewed by
the Companys independent accountants as provided in SAS 100 (all such
information, the " _Required Information_ ")

(B) periodically update the Required Information so that, to the Knowledge of
the Company, such Required Information does not contain any untrue statement
of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, not misleading (other than information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates);

 

(C) participate on reasonable advance notice in a reasonable number of
meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as
lead arranger or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the
Debt Financing and senior management and representatives, with appropriate
seniority and expertise, of the Companys and its Subsidiaries business),
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies in connection
with the Debt Financing;

 

(D) assist with the preparation of materials for rating agencies and rating
agency presentations, bank information memoranda, offering documents
(including assistance in the preparation of Parents pro forma financial
statements giving effect to the transactions hereunder), private placement
memoranda, offering memoranda and similar 

 



56  documents required in connection with the Debt Financing (and providing
reasonable and customary authorization letters to the financing sources
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders and
containing customary information);

(E) cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to satisfy the conditions precedent
to the Debt Financing to the extent within the control of the Company and
cause the taking of corporate actions (subject to the occurrence of the
Closing) by the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit
the completion of the Debt Financing;

(F) obtain customary accountants comfort letters, appraisals and surveys,
title insurance and other documentation and items relating to the Debt
Financing as reasonably requested by Parent and, if requested by Parent or
Merger Sub, cooperate with and assist Parent or Merger Sub in obtaining such
documentation and items; and 

(G) provide reasonable assistance to Parent and Merger Sub in obtaining any
corporate credit and family ratings from any ratings agencies as contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter;

_provided_ , that (w) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, (x) no action, liability or obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
under any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument
relating to the Debt Financing shall be effective until the Effective Time or
immediately prior thereto (except for customary authorization letters
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders and
containing a representation that the public side versions of such documents,
if any, do not include material non-public information regarding the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their securities), (y) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
Representatives, shall be required to provide any legal opinion or other
opinion of counsel prior to the Effective Time in connection with the
Financing, and (z) any bank information memoranda and high-yield offering
prospectuses or memoranda required in relation to the Debt Financing shall
contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving
Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment fee or other fee or payment to obtain consent
or to incur any liability with respect to or cause or permit any Lien to be
placed on any of their respective assets in connection with the Debt Financing
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by this _Section 5.6 _(in an amount not to exceed $3,000,000
(three million dollars)) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them of any type in connection with the arrangement of any Financing and any
information used in connection therewith except with respect to any
information prepared or provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives or to the extent such losses,
damages,

 



57  claims, costs or expenses result from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives, and the foregoing obligations shall survive termination of
this Agreement.

(d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly provide
Parent with an electronic version of the trademarks, service marks and
corporate logo of the Company and its Subsidiaries for use in marketing
materials for the purpose of facilitating the syndication of the Debt
Financing, and hereby consents to the reasonable use of the foregoing in
connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used in a
manner that is not intended to harm or disparage the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their marks and on such other customary terms and conditions
as the Company shall reasonably impose. All material non-public information
provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and
Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose such information to the financing
sources and other potential sources of capital, rating agencies and
prospective lenders and investors during syndication of the Financing or any
permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing subject to
the potential sources of capital, ratings agencies and prospective lenders and
investors entering into customary confidentiality undertakings with respect
to such information (including through a notice and undertaking in a form
customarily used in confidential information memoranda for senior credit
facilities).

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.6_ shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would (i) cause any condition to Closing set forth in _Article VI_
to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement, (ii)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that will
conflict with or violate the Companys or any if its Subsidiarys
organizational documents or any laws or result in the contravention of, or
would reasonably be expected to result in a material violation of, or material
default under, any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party on the date of this Agreement, unless contingent on
the Closing, or (iii) reasonably be expected to result in any officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurring any personal
liability that is not contingent upon the Closing.

(f) _Acknowledgement_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations
to perform their respective agreements hereunder, including to consummate the
Closing subject to the terms and conditions hereof, are not conditioned on
obtaining of the Financing or any alternative Financing or on the performance
of any party to any Financing Letter.

5.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement among the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise
to minimize the effect of such law on this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub.

 



58 5.8 _Access_. Until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall afford
Parent, its Affiliates and its financing sources and their respective
financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other
agents and representatives reasonable access during normal business hours,
upon reasonable prior notice provided to the Companys Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, to the properties, books and records and
personnel of the Company as Parent may reasonably request; _provided,
however,_ that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any
documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable law or
regulation requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to
such documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or
cause a default under, or give a third party the right to terminate or
accelerate the rights under, such Contract (it being agreed that the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to design and implement alternative
procedures to enable Parent to evaluate any such Contract without causing a
violation or causing a default thereunder or giving any third party a right
to terminate or accelerate the rights thereunder); or (d) such disclosure
relates to individual performance or personnel evaluation records, medical
histories or other personnel information that in the Companys good faith
opinion could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to liability; and
_provided, further,_ that nothing in this _Section 5.8_ shall be construed to
require the Company or its Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses,
appraisals, opinions or other information. Any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 5.8_ shall be conducted
in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a material risk of
damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys properties shall be subject to
the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and
shall not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
obtained by Parent, its Affiliates and its financing sources or any of their
respective financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel,
accountants and other agents and representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
5.8_.

5.9 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall be permitted to take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is or was a director or executive officer of the Company or
other individual subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

5.10 _Directors  and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective current or former 

 



59  directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ "). In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation
and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six-year
period such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner except as required by applicable law.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against, and
advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses to each Indemnified
Person in respect of, any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains
directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or
omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (prior to or at the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that if, at
any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent or the Surviving Corporation a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section 5.10(b), then
the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation
or inquiry, (A) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the
defense thereof (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 5.10(b)_, the
Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto); (B) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel; (C) the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of outside counsel promptly after statements
therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to
control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry;
and (D) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected
without his or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.10(b)_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates
(including Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

 



60 (c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO
Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the
DandO Insurance; _provided, however,_ that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 5.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount
paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three
hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which
premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in _Section
5.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule); _provided, however,_ that that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy for such year with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance at a cost per year covered for such tail
policy not to exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. In the event that the Company
elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
the Surviving Corporation (and Parent) under the first sentence of this 
_Section 5.10(c)_ for the full term of such "tail" policy.

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

(e) The obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.10_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any material manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 5.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior
written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 5.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the
Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section 5.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 5.10_, with full rights of enforcement against the Surviving
Corporation and Parent as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or
the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 5.10(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this  _Section 5.10_ shall

 



61  be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such
persons may have under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements
of or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable
law (whether at law or in equity).

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.10_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor the Employee Plans set
forth on _Schedule 5.11_ (the " _Continuing Plans_ ") in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_
that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from
amending or terminating any such Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in
accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by applicable law.

 

(b) The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to) continue
employment immediately following the Effective Time by the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries of all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, subject to  _Section 5.11(d)_ hereof.
For the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2012
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide to the Continuing Employees
who remain employed for the requisite period either (i) compensation and
benefits arrangements (but excluding equity based benefits) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits arrangements
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
or (ii) compensation and benefits arrangements (other than equity based
benefits) to each Continuing Employee that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the compensation and benefits (other than equity based
benefits) provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent; or (iii) provide
some combination of (i) and (ii) above; _provided_ that in each case
each Continuing Employee receives compensation and benefits arrangements
(other than equity based benefits) that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits arrangements
(other than equity based benefits) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) During the Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) use commercially reasonable
efforts cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under any 401(k) plan in
which such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate and, solely for
purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay, benefit entitlement to the
same extent

 



62  recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries under an analogous Employee
Plan; _provided_ , however, that such service need not be credited under any
equity-based or non-qualified deferred compensation plan or arrangement or to
the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (such plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_
") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage in the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs under an Employee Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to
any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or
similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived in the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the corresponding Old Plan
as of the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins in the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs to be given credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, co-pay, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan to the extent such requirements would have been given credit
under the applicable Old Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but
unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time to
the extent reflected as a working capital liability on the Companys balance
sheet

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment
for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to terminate, any Continuing Employee
at any time and for any or no reason, subject to the terms of any employment
agreements between Continuing Employees and the Company that govern
termination of such employees following a change in control; (ii) alter or
limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary; (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in
any Person (including any Continuing Employee or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof) other than the parties to this Agreement; or (iv) establish, amend
or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract or
arrangement.

5.12 _Obligations of Parent in respect of Merger Sub and Surviving
Corporation_ . Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this

case such that it would result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_; _provided, however,_ that no such

Affiliates, shall issue any public release or make any public announcement or

unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such release,
announcement or disclosure may, after consultation with outside counsel, be
required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the
relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the

7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2_ or this _Section 7.3_,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party or parties, as
applicable, incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 



70 (b) _Company Payments_.

 

(i) In the event that (A) following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)_ or _Section 7.1(e)_ (I) a Company Board Recommendation Change occurs
or (II) a Competing Alternative Transaction shall have been publicly announced
by any Person other than Parent or Merger Sub and not withdrawn or otherwise

7.1(e)_, either a Competing Alternative Transaction is consummated or the

applicable, by an amount equal to the amount of Parent Expenses previously
paid by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent, concurrently with the consummation of such Competing
Alternative Transaction.

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_ then, at the time of such termination, the Company shall
pay to Parent an amount equal to the reasonable and documented out of pocket
fees and expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including without
limitation any commitment fees and the reasonable and documented out of pocket
fees and expenses (including all reasonable and documented fees and expenses
of outside counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants

_Parent Expenses_ "); _provided, however_ , that the amount of Parent Expenses
required to be paid under this _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_ shall not exceed
$4,500,000 (four million five-hundred thousand dollars) in the aggregate. In
the event that the Company Termination Fee later becomes payable by the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(i) _after the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, then the Parent Expenses to
the extent previously paid by the Company pursuant to this _Section
7.3(b)(ii)_ shall be credited against the Company Termination Fee then
payable.

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1(f), Section 7.1(h) _or _Section 7.1(j)_, the Company shall pay

that in no event shall (i) the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (ii) Parent be required to pay,
or to cause to be paid, the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
in each case whether nor not the Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable under more than one provision
of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of
different events.

 

(e) _Limitation of Liability_.

(i) Parents receipt of the Company Termination Fee and, if applicable,
reimbursement of expenses from the Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_
shall, subject to _Section 7.3(f)_ and _Section 8.8_, be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company, its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective former, current and future
directors, officers, employees, agents, general and limited partners,
managers, members, stockholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former,
current or future director, officer, employee, agent, stockholder, general or
limited partner, manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of
the foregoing (collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") in respect of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as
a result of the termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Merger to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether
intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise, and upon payment
of such Company Termination Fee no Company Party shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the Equity Financing Letter
and the Debt Commitment Letter to the contrary, in the event that Parent or
Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing for any reason or no reason or any of
them otherwise breaches this Agreement (or any representation, warranty or
covenant hereof) (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise) or otherwise fail to perform hereunder (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) then, except for the
right of the Company to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief pursuant to, and only to the extent
expressly permitted by,  _Section 8.8_, the Companys right to receive the
Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_, together
with the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under
_Section 5.6(c)_, the guarantee thereof pursuant to the Guarantee, and any
amounts payable under _Section 7.3(f) _shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of any of the
Company Parties for damages (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) against (A) Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub),
(B) the former, current or future holders of any direct or indirect equity,
partnership or limited liability company interest of Parent or Merger Sub,
(C) any lender, prospective lender, arranger or agent of or under the Debt
Financing or any of their respective former, current or future equityholders,
(D) any holders or future holders of any capital stock or other equity
interest (including any options, warrants, calls, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights,
stock-based performance units with respect to such interest or stock) of
Parent or Merger Sub, and (E) controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, stockholders or assignees of any of the foregoing 

 



72  (collectively, the " _Parent Parties_ ," and each, a " _Parent Party_ ") in
respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the termination of this Agreement, the failure
of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder (whether intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise
and , in such circumstances when the Parent Termination Fee is due and payable
hereunder by Parent, upon payment of such Parent Termination Fee, no Parent
Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
provisions of this _Section 7.3(e)(ii)_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Parent Party.

(f) _Costs of Recovery_. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this  _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this 
_Section 7.3(f)_ do not constitute a penalty but constitute payment of
liquidated damages and that the harmed partys liquidated damages amount is
reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to
be caused by such other partys breach or default under this Agreement, the
difficulty of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility
of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions
to be consummated hereunder; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly
pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly
pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amount set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_ or any portion thereof or a judgment
against Parent for the amount set forth in _Section 7.3(c)_ or any portion
thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company, on the other hand, (i)
its reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable out-
of-pocket attorneys fees) incurred in connection with such suit and (ii)
interest on the amount payable pursuant to such judgment at the prime rate of
Citibank N.A. in effect on the date of payment, with such interest being
payable in respect of the period from the date that payment was originally
required to be made pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_ of this
Agreement, as applicable, through the date of payment.

obligations or exercise their rights or legal remedies under this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 4.3(d)_).

8.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Guarantee and the
Equity Financing Letter, constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements

EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB, ON THE ONE HAND,
NOR THE COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES

application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

8.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants, obligations or agreements set forth in this Agreement, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall,
subject to the following sentence, be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by
the other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the
other under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
it is explicitly agreed that (i) the Company shall not be entitled to seek
specific performance of Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded to fund the Merger (including by requiring Parent and/or Merger Sub
to file one or more lawsuits against the Guarantors or any Equity Financing
Source to fully enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantee
and of the Equity Financing Source under the Equity Financing Letter and
Parents and/or Merger Subs rights thereunder) or cause the Merger to be
consummated or the payments required to be made pursuant to Article I, unless:
(A) all conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and that
would be capable of being satisfied if there were a Closing) have been
satisfied, (B) the financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter (or,
if alternative financing is being used in accordance with _Section 5.6_,
pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto), has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (C)
the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if
specific performance is granted pursuant to this _Section 8.8_ and the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Company is ready, willing
and able to consummate the Merger and (D) Parent and Merger Sub are required
to complete the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.3_, and Parent and Merger Sub
have not completed the Closing; and (ii) the Company shall not be entitled to
seek specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to enforce the terms
of

 



76  the Debt Commitment Letter, including by demanding Parent and/or Merger Sub
to file one or more lawsuits against the sources of the Debt Financing to
fully enforce such sources obligations thereunder and Parents and/or Merger
Subs rights thereunder, unless (A) all of the conditions in _Section 6.1_
and _Section 6.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing and that would be capable of being satisfied if
there were a Closing) have been satisfied, (B) all of the conditions to the
consummation of the Debt Financing have been satisfied (or, with respect to
certificates to be delivered at the consummation of the Debt Financing, are
capable of being satisfied upon consummation) and (C) Parent and Merger Sub
are required to complete the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.3_, and Parent
and Merger Sub have not completed the Closing.

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other
parties hereto (as applicable) and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the parties
under this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the
remedies provided for in _Section 8.8(a)_, a party shall not in any respect
waive its right to seek payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee in the event that this Agreement has not been terminated and
in the event that the remedies provided for in _Section 8.8(a)_ are
not available or otherwise are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this
_Section 8.8(b)_ shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding
for (or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under _Section 8.8(a)_ as a condition of exercising any
termination right under _Article VII_ , and (iii) the commencement of any
Legal Proceeding pursuant to _Section 8.8(a) _shall not restrict or limit
any partys right to terminate this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter, except to the extent such right to terminate this Agreement is
expressly prohibited in _Section 7.1(c)_. Any party seeking an injunction
or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce by specific performance the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving regard to
any principles of conflicts of law thereof to the extent they would result in
the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision herein, each of the parties hereto hereby
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the providers
of the Debt Financing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, or any of
