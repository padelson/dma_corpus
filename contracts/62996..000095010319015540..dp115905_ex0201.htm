expressly contemplated or permitted to be taken (or not taken) pursuant to

Article 2 
 Purchase and Sale

  



  

Section 2.01. _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer agrees to purchase
from Seller, and Seller agrees to sell to Buyer, free and clear of all Liens,
the Interests.

  



  

Section 2.02. _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Interests (the
"Purchase Price") shall be paid in the form of (i) the Estimated Cash Closing
Purchase Price, and (ii) the Preferred Stock, as adjusted for the Adjustment
Amounts in the manner contemplated by _Annex A_ and Section 2.06. The
Purchase Price shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.05 and shall be
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.06 and Section 7.06.

  



  

Section 2.03. _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing (the "Closing") of the transactions contemplated by
Section 2.01 shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450
Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017 or remotely by the exchange of
signature pages for executed documents, as promptly as practicable (but no
later than two Business Days) after the date on which all conditions set
forth in Article 8 shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such other
time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree; _provided_ that Buyer shall not
be required to effect the Closing prior to the date which is two Business
Days following the final day of the Marketing Period (or such date during the
Marketing Period specified by Buyer on at least two Business Days' written
notice to the Company (it being understood that such earlier date during the
Marketing Period may be conditioned on the simultaneous closing of the Debt
Financing)).

  



  

Section 2.04. _Estimated Closing Calculations_ _._ Not less than two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written
statement setting forth (a) Seller's good faith estimates of (i) Closing Net
Working Capital ("Estimated Closing Net Working Capital"), (ii) Closing
Indebtedness ("Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), (iii) Closing Cash
("Estimated Closing Cash") and (iv) Transaction Expenses ("Estimated
Transaction Expenses"), (b) Seller's calculation of the Estimated Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, and (c) on the basis of the foregoing, a
calculation of the Estimated Cash Closing Purchase Price (together with the
calculations

  



    

19

 



    

referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above, the "Preliminary Closing
Statement"). Buyer shall have the right to review and provide comments to
Seller on the Preliminary Closing Statement, and Seller shall consider any
such comments in good faith. In connection with Buyer's review, Seller shall
provide Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to the records,
documents and work papers of the Companies relating to the preparation of the
Preliminary Closing Statement. Seller shall not permit any change to the
amount of Indebtedness or distribute any Cash of the Companies to itself or
any of its other Subsidiaries between the Reference Time and the Closing by
virtue of a breach of Section 5.01 hereof, and in the event of any such
breach, Buyer shall be permitted to adjust for such amounts in its
calculation of Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness included in the Final
Closing Statement.

  



  

Section 2.05. _Closing Deliverables_. (a) At or prior to Closing, Seller
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer:

  



  

(i) certificates for the Interests, duly endorsed or accompanied by, as
applicable, stock powers, limited liability company interest powers or
other instruments of transfer;

  



  

(ii) the certificate referred to in Section 8.01(b)(iv);

  



  

(iii) a counterpart to the Transition Services Agreement duly executed
by Seller; and

  



  

(iv) a duly executed certificate pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) certifying that Seller is not a "foreign person" as
defined in Section 1445 of the Code.

  



  

(b) At or before Closing, Buyer (or, in the case of Section
2.05(b)(iii) below, Holdco) shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller:

  



  

(i) the certificate referred to in Section 8.01(c)(iii);

  



  

(ii) a counterpart to the Transition Services Agreement duly executed
by Buyer; and

  



  

(iii) a stock certificate issued by Holdco for the Preferred Stock.

Purchase Price in U.S. dollars and in immediately available funds by wire

(as identified in writing by Seller to Buyer at least two Business Days prior
to the Closing) the Estimated Transaction Expenses so identified, if any.

  



  

Section 2.06. _Adjustment Amount_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, and in any event within 75 calendar days
thereof, Buyer shall

  



    

20

 



    

prepare and deliver to Seller (i) a calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital, (ii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all Closing
Indebtedness, (iii) a calculation of Closing Cash, (iv) a calculation of
Transaction Expenses, (v) Buyer's calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, and (vi) on the basis of the foregoing, a
calculation of the Closing Cash Purchase Price (together with the
calculations referred to in clauses (i) through (vi) above, the "Final
Closing Statement"). The Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness
and Closing Cash shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and the defined terms used in this Section 2.06(a); _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Final Closing Statement (and any amounts included therein)
shall not give effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any act or omission by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Companies taken at, after or in connection with the
Closing or reflect any payments of cash in respect of the Purchase Price, or
any financing transactions in connection therewith or reflect any expense or
liability for which Buyer is responsible under this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the calculations and the purchase price adjustment to be
made pursuant to this Section 2.06 are only meant to reflect the proper
calculation of Closing Cash Purchase Price (and the inputs thereto) in
accordance with the applicable definitions contained therein and otherwise in
this Agreement and the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Section 2.06 is intended to be used to adjust for errors or
omissions that may be found with respect to the Financial Statements or any
inconsistencies between the Accounting Principles, on the one hand, and GAAP,
on the other. No action taken by Buyer occurring at, after or in connection
with the Closing, and no change in GAAP or Applicable Law after the Balance
Sheet Date, shall be taken into consideration in the calculations to be made
pursuant to Section 2.04 or this Section 2.06. If Buyer fails to timely
deliver the Final Closing Statement in accordance with the first sentence of
this Section 2.06(a) within such 75-day period, then, at the election of
Seller in its sole discretion either (x) the Preliminary Closing Statement
delivered by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.04 shall be deemed to be
the Final Closing Statement for all purposes hereunder or (y) Seller shall be
entitled to retain (at the sole cost and expense of Buyer) an independent
accounting firm of recognized national standing to provide an audit of the
books of the Companies, determine the calculation of, and prepare, the Final
Closing Statement consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.06(a), the
determination of such independent accounting firm being conclusive, final and
binding on the parties hereto.

  



  

(b) Following delivery of the Final Closing Statement, Buyer shall
provide Seller and its Representatives reasonable access to the records,
properties, personnel and (subject to the execution of customary work paper
access letters if requested) auditors of the Companies relating to the
preparation of the Final Closing Statement and shall cause the personnel of
the Companies to cooperate with Seller in connection with its review of the
Final Closing Statement.

  



  

(c) If Seller shall disagree with any of Buyer's calculations contained
in the Final Closing Statement, Seller shall notify Buyer of such
disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of
such disagreement, within 60 days after their receipt of the Final Closing
Statement. In the event that Seller does not

  



    

21

 



    

provide such a notice of disagreement within such 60-day period, Seller shall
be deemed to have agreed to the Final Closing Statement (including the
determinations included therein) delivered by Buyer, which shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such
notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and Seller shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts for a period of 30 days (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree) to seek in good faith to resolve any
disagreements with respect to any calculations contained in the Final Closing
Statement. If, at the end of such period, Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve such disagreements, then any remaining disagreements, including any
updates to their calculations of such items after the good faith discussions
process between the parties pursuant to this Section 2.06(c) (the
"Disputed Items"), shall, at the written request of either Buyer or Seller,
be resolved by Deloitte or such other independent accounting firm of
nationally recognized standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and Seller
(who shall not have any material relationship with Seller, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates) (such firm, the "Auditor"). Buyer and Seller
shall promptly provide their assertions regarding the Disputed Items
in writing to the Auditor and to each other. The Auditor shall be instructed
to render its determination with respect to the Disputed Items as soon as
reasonably possible (which the parties hereto agree should not be later than
60 days following the date on which the disagreement is referred to the
Auditor). The Auditor shall adopt a position and issue a written report and a
ruling only in respect of the Disputed Items by determining which of the
positions of Buyer or Seller submitted to the Auditor is, in the aggregate,
more accurate pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.06 (which report shall
include a worksheet setting forth the material calculations used in arriving
at such determination), and, based on such determination, adopt either the
aggregate amount claimed by Buyer or the aggregate amount claimed by Seller
with respect to the Disputed Items. The Auditor shall base its determination
solely on (i) the written submissions of the parties and shall not conduct
an independent investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Transaction
Expenses require adjustment (only with respect to the Disputed Items submitted
to the Auditor) in order to be determined in accordance with Section 2.06(a)
(including the definitions of the defined terms used in Section 2.06(a)). The
determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The date on which Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Transaction Expenses, Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount and Closing Cash Purchase Price are finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.06(c) is hereinafter referred to as the
"Determination Date." All fees and expenses of the Auditor relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor hereunder shall be borne by the
party whose positions were not adopted by the Auditor.

  



  

(d) The "Adjustment Amount," which may be positive or negative, shall
mean the Closing Cash Purchase Price (as finally determined in accordance
with Section 2.06(a) or 2.06(c), as applicable) _minus_ the Estimated Cash
Closing Purchase Price. The Adjustment Amount shall be deemed paid in
accordance with Section 2.06(e).

  



  

(e) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number (such amount, the
"Increase Amount"), then thereupon an amount equal to the Increase Amount
shall be

  



    

22

 



    

deemed to have been added to the initial liquidation preference of the
Preferred Stock as of the Closing, _ab initio,_ in accordance with the terms
and conditions thereof. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the
absolute value of such amount, the "Deficit Amount"), then thereupon an
amount equal to the Deficit Amount shall be deemed to have been deducted from
the initial liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock as of the Closing,
_ab initio,_ in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof.

  



  

Section 2.07. _Withholding_. Any amounts payable under this Agreement shall
be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction for Taxes or for any
other reason, unless such deduction is required by Applicable Law. To the
extent that any such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts will
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. All
compensatory amounts subject to payroll reporting and withholding payable
pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be payable promptly to
the applicable Person through the applicable Company's payroll in
accordance with applicable payroll procedures. If Buyer, any Company or any
other applicable withholding agent reasonably believes that it is required to
deduct and withhold from the payment of any amounts payable hereunder under
Applicable Law (other than compensatory amounts subject to payroll reporting
and withholding), Buyer shall (a) promptly notify Seller that Buyer is
required by Applicable Law to withhold from such amount payable under this
Agreement, which notice shall include a description of the legal and
factual basis for such withholding and the applicable rate thereof, and (b)
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller to minimize or
eliminate the amount of any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld under
Applicable Law.

Article 4 
 Representations and Warranties of Buyer

  



  

Buyer represents and warrants to Seller as follows as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing:

  



  

Section 4.01. _Existence and Power_. Buyer is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has all organizational powers required to carry on its
business as now conducted.

  



  

Section 4.02. _Authorization_. (a) The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a
party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby are within the organizational powers of Buyer and have been duly
authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of Buyer.

  



  

(b) This Agreement constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable
agreement of Buyer and each other Transaction Agreement to which Buyer is a
party, when executed and delivered by Buyer, will constitute a valid, binding
and enforceable agreement of Buyer, subject, in the case of enforceability,
to the Enforceability Exception.

  



  

Section 4.03. _Governmental Authorization_. Performance of this Agreement by
Buyer requires no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority other than (a) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act; (b) the filing of applications and notices with,
and receipt of approvals, licenses, or consents of, the Governmental
Authorities set forth on Section 3.04 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; (c)
any actions required to be taken in order to effect the Holdco Charter
Amendment and (d) any actions or filings, the absence of which would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair
or delay Buyer's ability to perform or comply with its obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Other than its
direct or indirect interests in Buyer and its Subsidiaries, neither the
ultimate parent entity (for purposes of compliance with the HSR Act) of Buyer
nor any of such ultimate parent's Affiliates owns any interest in any Person
that derives a substantial portion of its revenues from products, services or
lines of business within the Business' principal products, services or lines
of business, and Buyer is not aware of any reason why any actions by or in
respect of, or filings with, any Governmental Authority referred to in
Section 4.03 will not be made or obtained promptly after the date hereof and
in any event by the End Date.

  



  

Section 4.04. _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby do not and will not (a) violate the organizational documents of Buyer;
(b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, violate
any Applicable Law, require any consent or other action by any Person under,
constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of Buyer or to a loss
of any benefit to which Buyer is entitled under any provision of any
agreement or other instrument binding upon Buyer or (c) result in the

  



    

40

 



    

creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Buyer, except for any
Permitted Encumbrances and with such exceptions, in the case of clauses (b)
and (c), as would not, reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to materially impair or delay Buyer's ability to perform or
comply with its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.05. _Reserved_.

  



  

Section 4.06. _Financing_. (a) Buyer has delivered to Seller prior to the
date hereof true and complete copies of (i) a fully executed commitment
letter, dated as of the date hereof, by and among Buyer and the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto, including all annexes, exhibits, schedules
and other attachments thereto and all executed fee letters associated
therewith (other than the fees and other commercially sensitive information
set forth therein, which have been redacted; _provided_ that Buyer represents
and warrants that any such redacted information does not include, or permit
the imposition of, any new or additional conditions (or modify or expand any
existing conditions)) (the "Debt Commitment Letter"), dated as of the date
hereof, pursuant to which the lenders and other parties thereto have
committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
provide Buyer with debt financing in the amounts set forth therein in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Debt Financing")
and (ii) a fully executed investment agreement, including all annexes,
exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto (the "Investment Agreement"
and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Financing
Commitment Letters"), dated as of the date hereof, by and between Hux
Investment Pte. Ltd. (the "Equity Financing Source") and Holdco, pursuant to
which the Equity Financing Source has committed to provide equity financing in
the amount and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Equity
Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing").

  



  

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is
in full force and effect and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, (ii) the
Investment Agreement is in full force and effect and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Holdco and the other parties thereto and (iii) each of
the Financing Commitment Letters is enforceable against Buyer or Holdco (as
applicable) and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exception. As of the
date of this Agreement, no Financing Commitment Letter has been amended or
modified in any respect, no provisions or rights thereunder have been waived
and the respective commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn,
rescinded or otherwise modified in any respect, nor is any such amendment,
modification, withdrawal or rescission currently contemplated or the subject
of discussions, except for amendments or modifications to join agents, co-
agents, lenders, arrangers, bookrunners or other Persons that have not
executed the Financing Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement.
As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach under (A)
the Debt Commitment Letter on the part of Buyer or, to the knowledge of Buyer,
any other party thereto, or (B) the Investment Agreement on the part of
Holdco or any other party

  



    

41

 



    

thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer is not aware of any fact,
event or other occurrence that makes any of the representations and warranties
of Buyer or Holdco (as applicable) in any Financing Commitment Letter
inaccurate in any material respect. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies directly or
indirectly related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing contemplated to be funded at the Closing (including any flex
provisions) other than the conditions precedent expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letters, and, as of the date of this Agreement, assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01(a) and (b),
Buyer has no reason to believe that (x) it or any other party thereto will not
be able to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing
Commitment Letters, including any condition to the closing of the
Financing, or (y) the full amount of the Financing contemplated to be funded
at the Closing will not be made available to Buyer at or prior to the
Closing. Other than as set forth or described in the Financing Commitment
Letters, there are no side letters or other contracts, contingencies or
conditions precedent to the obligations of counterparties thereto to provide
the Financing or that would permit the counterparties thereto to reduce the
total amount of the Financing. The aggregate proceeds of the Financings are in
an amount sufficient to (1) consummate the Closing upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement, (2) pay all other amounts payable by Buyer in
connection with the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and required to be paid on the Closing Date and (3) pay all related
fees and expenses of Buyer and its Affiliates required to be paid on the
Closing Date. Buyer has fully paid, or caused to be paid, any and all
commitment fees and any and all other fees and expenses, in each case as are
required to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of the Financing Commitment Letters.

  



  

(c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing shall not be a
condition to any obligations of Buyer hereunder, including the obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(d) Buyer has and at all times will have sufficient cash on hand,
together with undrawn capacity under its existing bank revolver facility, in
the aggregate to make any payment of the Termination Fee (and any related
amounts payable by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.03 hereof) if such amounts
were due and payable at such time.

  



  

Section 4.07. _Solvency_. Buyer is not entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of the Business. Assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01(a) and (b), immediately after
the Closing, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer, Holdco and their respective Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its assets will not
be less than the sum of its debts and that the present fair saleable value of
its assets will not be less than the amount required to pay its
probable liabilities on its debts as they become absolute and matured), (b)
will not have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business
and (c) will not have incurred (or intend to incur) debts beyond its ability
to pay as they become absolute and matured.

  



    

42

 



    

Section 4.08. _Purchase for Investment_. Buyer is purchasing the Interests
for investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or together
with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Interests and is capable of bearing the economic risks of
such investment.

  



  

Section 4.09. _Litigation_. Buyer is not a claimant or defendant in or
otherwise a party to any litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings
concerning its business, which are in progress or, to Buyer's knowledge,
threatened or pending by or against or concerning its business that would
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair
Buyer's ability to perform or comply with its obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.10. _Finders ' Fees_. Other than in connection with the Debt
Financing (the fees and expenses of which will be borne in full by
Buyer), there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary
that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Buyer who
might be entitled to any fee or commission from any Person in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.11. _Inspections; No Other Representations_ _._ Buyer is an
informed and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert
advisors, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of businesses such as
its acquisition of the Interests as contemplated hereunder. Buyer has
undertaken such investigation and has been provided with and has evaluated
such documents and information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to
make an informed and intelligent decision with respect to the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that Seller
has given Buyer complete and open access to the employees, documents and
facilities of the Business, and Buyer has undertaken prior to the date hereof
all investigations and inquiries and has requested all documents and
information as it deems necessary in connection with entry into this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer agrees to
accept the Interests and the Business in the condition they are in on the
Closing Date based upon its own inspection, examination and determination
with respect thereto as to all matters and without reliance upon any express
or implied representations or warranties of any nature made by Seller or any
Company or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, partners, members, advisors or other
representatives, except as specifically and expressly set forth in Article
3, the Transaction Documents, and any certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 2.05. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
acknowledges that none of Seller, any Company or any of their respective
Affiliates makes any representation or warranty with respect to (a) any
projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to Buyer of
future revenues, future results of operations (or any component thereof),
future cash flows or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of
the Business or (b) any other information or documents made available to
Buyer or its counsel, accountants or advisors with respect to the
Business, except as expressly set forth in Article 3, the Transaction
Documents, and any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.05.

and Buyer, after the Closing, agree to cause the Companies to execute and
deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and
to take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to
consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Holdco shall effect the Holdco Charter Amendment prior to Closing,
and shall take any and all actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order
to give effect to the foregoing under Applicable Law.

  



  

(b) Seller and Buyer agree, and Seller, prior to the Closing, and
Buyer, after the Closing, agree to cause the Companies, to execute
and deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings
and to take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to
consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Buyer and Seller shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within five Business Days
of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act and, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of Section 5.03(a),
use commercially reasonable efforts to take all other actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable (including, unless Seller agrees otherwise,
requesting the early termination thereof). In connection with the obligations
of the parties under this Section 5.03, Buyer may, in its sole discretion and
on one occasion only on or after the 20th day after the date hereof (or as
otherwise agreed by the parties), withdraw and refile pursuant to 16 C.F.R.
803.12 its Notification and Report Form filed pursuant to the HSR Act (the
"HSR Form"), so long as the HSR Form is refiled no later than the end of the
second (2nd) Business Day after the withdrawal of the HSR Form.  If and only
if Buyer has not previously exercised its right to withdraw and refile the HSR
Form pursuant to this Section 5.03(b), then Seller may, in its sole
discretion and on one occasion only on or after the 20th day after the date
hereof (or as otherwise agreed by the parties), require that the Buyer
withdraw and refile the HSR Form pursuant to 16 C.F.R.

  



    

48

 



    

803.12 no later than the end of the second (2nd) Business Day after the
withdrawal of the HSR Form. Nothing herein shall prevent the parties hereto
from agreeing by mutual consent to Buyer withdrawing the HSR Form more than
one time.

  



  

(c) Subject to Applicable Law relating to the sharing of information,
each party hereto shall (i) furnish the other party with copies of
all documents (except documents or portions thereof for which confidential
treatment has been requested or given) and correspondence (A) prepared by or
on behalf of such party for any Governmental Authority and affording the other
party opportunity to comment and participate in responding, where
appropriate; and (B) received by or on behalf of such party from any
Governmental Authority, in each case in connection with any such consent,
authorization, order or approval and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with and keep the other party hereto informed as to the
status of such matters. Further, no party hereto shall, nor shall it permit
any of its Representatives to, meet or engage in material conversations with
any Governmental Authority or representative of such Governmental Authority
in connection with obtaining any such consent, authorization, order and
approval unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent not precluded by Applicable Law
or regulation or exempted by this Agreement, offers the other party the
opportunity to participate in such meeting or conversation. Each of Seller
and Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take, refrain from
taking or cause to be taken any action (including, for the sake of clarity,
any other acquisition or investment) that it is aware or should reasonably be
aware would have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of
any consent, authorization, order or approval of any
Governmental Authorities.

  



  

Section 5.04. _Access_. (a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date,
Seller shall (i) give Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other authorized Representatives, who are bound by the Confidentiality
Agreement, reasonable access during Working Hours to the offices and
properties, and to copies of books and records, of the Business; (ii) furnish
to Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
Representatives, who are bound by the Confidentiality Agreement, such
financial and operating data and any other information relating to the
Business as such Persons may reasonably request; and (iii) instruct the
employees, counsel and financial advisors of the Companies to cooperate with
Buyer in its investigation of the Business in each case, including by
providing reasonable access and assistance required in connection with
transition planning and any steps required to ensure the
independent operation of the Business following the Closing. Any
investigation pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall be conducted in such
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the Business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) Seller shall not be required to provide or
cause to be provided access to or disclose or cause to be disclosed
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege ( _provided_ that Seller shall notify Buyer in reasonable
detail of the circumstances giving rise to such privilege and cooperate with
Buyer and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the applicable
information or access in a manner that does not jeopardize such privilege),
contravene any Applicable Law or contravene any confidentiality undertaking;
and (B) prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall have no right to perform or
cause to be performed any invasive or subsurface investigations of the
properties of the Business, including any

  



    

49

 



    

sampling or testing of the air, soil, surface water, groundwater, building
materials or other environmental media.

  



  

(b) On and after the Closing Date, Buyer will, and will cause the
Companies to, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the books
and records of the business of the Companies for a period of eight years in
accordance with its ordinary course document retention policies; _provided_ ,
that Buyer may dispose of any such books and records during such eight year
period if the same are first offered in writing to Seller and not accepted by
Seller within forty-five (45) days of such offer; (ii) upon
reasonable written notice and during Working Hours, afford to Seller and its
agents reasonable access to (A) properties, copies of books and records for
the period prior to Closing and (B) employees and auditors of the business of
the Companies, in each case to the extent necessary to permit Seller to
perform or satisfy Seller's preparation of financial statements and tax
returns relating to any period on or before the Closing Date or for any other
reasonable business purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not
be required to provide access or disclose information to the extent that such
access or disclosure relates to a dispute between Buyer and/or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and/or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, or would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege ( _provided_
that Buyer shall notify Seller in reasonable detail of the circumstances
giving rise to such privilege and cooperate with Seller and use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the applicable information or access in a
manner that does not jeopardize such privilege) or contravene any Applicable
Law.

  



  

(c) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, without Seller's prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, contact any
customers, vendors or suppliers of, or other third parties having business
relationships with, the Business, other than in the ordinary course of Buyer's
or its Affiliates' businesses or, after satisfaction of the condition set
forth in Section 8.01(a)(i), for transition planning (in coordination with
Seller and otherwise in a manner that is consistent with Applicable Law) where
such contact does not relate to the Business, this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and
is in any event conducted in compliance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in conducting meetings with such
persons, after satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 8.01(a)(i),
to the extent reasonably required in connection with the transition of the
Business.

  



  

(d) On and after the Closing Date, Seller will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable written notice and during Working Hours,
afford to Buyer and its agents reasonable access to (A) properties, copies of
books and records relating to the Business for the period prior to Closing
and still within the possession of Seller and (B) employees and auditors of
the business of the Companies, in each case to the extent necessary to permit
Buyer to address tax, HR or other audits of the Business or for any
other reasonable business purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
shall not be required to provide access or disclose information to the extent
that such access or disclosure relates to a dispute between Seller and/or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, or would jeopardize the attorney-client 

  



    

50

 



    

privilege ( _provided_ that Seller shall notify Buyer in reasonable detail of
the circumstances giving rise to such privilege and cooperate with Buyer and
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the applicable information or
access in a manner that does not jeopardize such privilege) or contravene any
Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 5.05. _Notices of Certain Events_. (a) Each party shall, to the
extent permissible by Applicable Law, promptly notify the other of each of
the following events if such event occurs prior to the Closing:

  



  

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (to the
extent notification thereof to Buyer is permitted by such Governmental
Authority); and

  



  

(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.12 (in the case of
Seller) or Section 4.09 (in the case of Buyer).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a party's good
faith failure to comply with this Section 5.05 shall not provide the
other party hereto the right not to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.06. _Seller Marks_. (a) Buyer and the Companies shall have no
right, title or interest in or to the "Masco" names and trademarks, any
trademarks or other indicia of origin listed in Section 5.06(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, any stylized variations, logos and designs used in
connection with the foregoing, any variation or derivative of any of the
foregoing, or any names, trademarks, logos or designs confusingly similar to
any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller Marks"). Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates (including,
as of the Closing, the Companies) shall acquire any goodwill, rights or
benefits arising from the Seller Marks and that all such goodwill, rights and
benefits shall inure solely to Seller.

  



  

(a) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller grants a
limited, non-exclusive right to Buyer and the Companies for a period of one
hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing to use the Seller Marks, but
solely to the extent necessary to allow Buyer and the Companies to market,
distribute and sell the products manufactured by the Companies prior to the
Closing Date (it being understood that (i) Buyer and the Companies shall only
utilize labels and packaging, advertising, marketing, sales and
promotional materials to the extent they existed immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and the Companies
shall neither (A) use any Seller Marks in any manner or for any purpose which
in any way differs from the use

  



    

51

 



    

of such Seller Marks by Seller or the Companies immediately prior to the
Closing Date, nor (B) manufacture or produce, or cause or permit any third
party to manufacture or produce, any new labels or packaging, advertising,
marketing, sales or promotional materials incorporating any Seller Marks in
any manner).

  



  

(b) Promptly upon the expiration of the period set forth in Section
5.06(b), the Companies shall (and Buyer shall cause the Companies to)
(i) cease all use of the Seller Marks (ii) destroy and dispose of all labels
and advertising, marketing, sales and promotional materials, in each case, in
its possession or subject to its control, bearing any Seller Marks, (iii)
cause their names to be changed to such other names that do not include the
Seller Marks and make all necessary filings and use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all applicable Governmental Authorities to change all
applications, registrations and filings, including corporate names, seals and
certificates of the Companies such that they will not include any Seller
Marks, and (iv) transfer any and all rights in all registrations for domain
names incorporating any Seller Marks to Seller. From and after the Closing,
none of Buyer, Buyer's Affiliates or any Company shall challenge the
ownership, validity or enforceability of any Seller Marks.

  



  

(c) Except with respect to the Company Intellectual Property Rights or
as expressly set forth in this Section 5.06, the parties acknowledge and
agree that neither party nor any of its Affiliates grants any license or other
right, title or interest in or to any of its or its Affiliates' Intellectual
Property Rights to the other party under this Agreement, whether by
implication, estoppel, exhaustion or otherwise, and each party retains and
reserves all rights with respect to its and its Affiliates'
Intellectual Property Rights not expressly granted under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not, and shall not,
convey, transfer or assign any right, title or interest in or to any
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party.

  



  

Section 5.07. _Public Announcements_. No party shall, without the prior
consultation of the other party hereto to the extent reasonably
practicable, issue any press release or make any other public announcement
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to
the extent required by Applicable Law, any regulatory or supervisory body or
the rules of any securities exchange to which the disclosing party is
subject. Buyer may confidentially make statements and disclose information
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
solely to its and its Affiliates' current and prospective direct and indirect
investors who are subject to customary confidentiality restrictions without
the prior written consent of any other party.

  



  

Section 5.08. _Intercompany Matters_. Effective as of the Closing, except (a)
for the Transition Services Agreement, (b) as contemplated by this Agreement
and (c) for those arrangements set forth on Section 5.08 or Section 5.11 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all intercompany accounts between Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the one hand, and any
Company, on the other hand, shall be settled and paid in full (regardless of
the terms of payment of such intercompany accounts), and all agreements
between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the
one

  



    

52

 



    

hand, and any Company, on the other hand, shall be terminated, in each case
without further liability or obligation (contingent or otherwise) of any
party thereunder. Seller shall afford Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review
all documentation relating to the settlement of such intercompany accounts,
if any, prior to their termination.

  



  

Section 5.09. _Letters of Credit; Other Obligations_. (a) From the date
hereof until no Business Credit Support remain outstanding (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, if applicable, after the Closing), Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) arrange for substitute letters of
credit, guarantees and other obligations to replace (A) any letters of credit,
guarantees, financial assurances, surety bonds, performance bonds and other
contractual obligations listed on Section 5.09(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule and entered into by or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than solely by (but not on behalf of) the Companies) in connection
with the Business, including the letters of credit, guarantees, financial
assurances, surety bonds, performance bonds, bid bonds, letters of indemnity
and other contractual obligations listed thereon outstanding as of the date of
this Agreement and (B) any letters of credit, guarantees, financial
assurances, surety bonds, performance bonds, bid bonds, letters of indemnity
and other contractual obligations entered into by or on behalf of Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than solely by (but not on behalf of) the
Companies) in connection with the Business in the ordinary course of business
on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing (collectively
under the immediately preceding clauses (A) and (B), together with all
obligations thereunder, the "Business Credit Support") or (ii) assume at
Closing all obligations under each Business Credit Support, obtaining from
the creditor or other counterparty (or, in the case of letters of credit,
bonds or other similar Business Credit Support, the issuing bank (or similar
entity) thereof) a full release (in a form and substance satisfactory to
Seller) of all parties liable, directly or indirectly, for reimbursement to
the creditor or issuing bank (or similar entity), as applicable, or
fulfillment of other obligations to a counterparty or issuing bank (or
similar entity), as applicable, in connection with amounts drawn or otherwise
due and payable under the Business Credit Support (including any lenders or
other financing parties participating in such letters of credit, bonds or
similar Business Credit Support). To the extent any Business Credit Support
remains outstanding following the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller against, and reimburse Seller for, all amounts paid
after Closing, including costs, fees or expenses in connection with such
Business Credit Support, including Seller's and its Affiliates' fees in
maintaining such Business Credit Support, whether or not any such Business
Credit Support is drawn upon or required to be paid or otherwise performed,
and shall in any event promptly reimburse Seller to the extent any Business
Credit Support is drawn upon and Seller or any of its Affiliates makes any
payment, including any reimbursement of the party issuing or otherwise
providing the Business Credit Support.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, as
promptly as practicable following Closing, Buyer shall file replacement
compliance bonds to be approved by the relevant Governmental Authority and
effective as of the Closing Date or as soon as possible thereafter, to
replace each of the bonds set forth on Section 5.09(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify Seller and its

  



    

53

 



    

Affiliates, and otherwise hold them harmless from, any draw downs or claims
with respect to such compliance bonds after the Closing.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer
shall not (i) enter into any transactions after the Closing in the name of
Seller or any of its Affiliates or, as reasonably practicable after the
Closing, that would be covered by a Business Credit Support or (ii) amend,
modify, extend or renegotiate any material term of any obligation that is
covered by a Business Credit Support in any manner that increases or extends
the potential exposure of Seller or any of its Affiliates under any Business
Credit Support.

  



  

(d) Buyer shall at all times (including after any termination of this
Agreement until payment of the Termination Fee) maintain sufficient cash on
hand, together with undrawn capacity under its existing bank revolver
facility, in the aggregate to make any payment of the Termination Fee (and
any related amounts payable by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.03 hereof) as and
when any such amounts may become due and payable.

  



  

Section 5.10. _Directors and Officers_. (a) From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall cause the Companies to maintain in effect and continue to provide to
the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, exculpation and other limitations on liability
currently existing in favor of any current or former Representative of each
Company (including any predecessors thereof) (collectively, such
Representatives, the "Seller Indemnitees") under, and in no event on terms
less favorable than those contained in, the organizational documents of any
Company in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall purchase or cause to be
purchased a non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers'
liability coverage of the Seller's existing directors' and officers' insurance
policies for the Seller Indemnitees and the Seller's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies for the Seller Indemnitees (collectively, the
"DandO Tail Policy"), which shall (i) be for a claims reporting or discovery
period of at least six years from and after the Closing with respect to any
claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Closing, (ii) be from
the Seller's current insurance carrier with respect to such coverage or an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating and (iii) have terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Seller's existing insurance coverage for the
Seller Indemnitees with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against the beneficiaries thereof by reason of their
having served in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the
Closing (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that (A) in no event shall Buyer be
required to expend for the DandO Tail Policy an aggregate premium amount in
excess of 300% of the premium amount per annum for the Seller's existing
insurance coverage for the Seller Indemnitees and (B) if the aggregate premium
amount for the DandO Tail Policy exceeds such amount, Buyer shall be obligated
to obtain a DandO Tail Policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect
to matters occurring prior to the Closing, for a cost not exceeding
such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as an

  



    

54

 



    

alternative to the foregoing and at Buyer's request and at Buyer's
expense (including the costs of filing a claim and any deductibles, premium
increases, Taxes or other amounts that are or become payable by Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller as a result of Seller's accommodation of Buyer's request),
Seller shall make commercially reasonable efforts to cause the officers and
directors of the Companies serving prior to the Closing to remain covered for
not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date under the Insurance
Policies providing directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance with respect to matters arising at or before the Closing,
including (to the extent such coverage is permitted thereunder) the
transactions contemplated herein.

  



  

(c) In the event that Buyer, any Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer, any such Company,
as the case may be, shall succeed to and be bound by the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.10.

  



  

(d) The obligations of Buyer under this Section 5.10 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to materially and adversely affect
any Seller Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.10 applies without the written
consent of such affected Seller Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that
each Seller Indemnitee shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section
5.10).

  



  

Section 5.11. _Assignment of Contracts and Rights_. (a) Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement that may be deemed to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Shared Contract or any claim
or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if such
assignment, without the consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a
breach or other contravention of such Shared Contract or in any way adversely
affect the rights of Seller, any Company or any of their respective
Affiliates thereunder. If such consent is not obtained, Seller and Buyer will,
until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, cooperate in a mutually
agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume
the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including sub-
contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer, or under which Seller
would enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer assuming Seller's
obligations, all rights of Seller against a third party thereto. In
connection with any Shared Contract that is (i) assigned, in whole or in part,
to Buyer, any Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) sub-
contracted, sub-licensed or sub-leased or under which Seller or any of its
Affiliates otherwise passes along any benefits thereunder, in each case
whether in whole or in part, to Buyer, any Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, Buyer hereby agrees to perform, and to cause to be performed,
all of its or such Company's or Subsidiary's (as applicable) obligations
thereunder and shall (A) promptly, but in any event within 30 days of being
invoiced therefor, reimburse Seller for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Seller or any of its Affiliates under any such Shared Contract and (B) hereby
indemnify Seller and its Affiliates, and otherwise hold them harmless from,
any failure to perform any such obligations.

  



    

55

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement that may be deemed to
the contrary, (i) neither Seller, Buyer nor any of their respective
Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall be required to expend money, incur any
liability, commence any litigation or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any such
consent to assign a Shared Contract, (ii) the assignment of any Shared
Contract shall not be a condition to the obligation of the parties hereto to
consummate this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (iii) in no event shall Buyer
be entitled to assert that a breach of this Section 5.11 shall have given
rise to a failure of the condition set forth in Section 8.01(b)(ii).

  



  

Section 5.12. _Insurance Coverage_ _._ (a) From and after the Closing, the
Business shall cease to be insured by, entitled to any benefits or coverage
under or entitled to seek benefits or coverage from or under any of Seller's
and its Affiliates' insurance policies or by any of their respective matching
deductible policies, other than: (i) for claims solely under the third party
insurance policies listed on Section 5.12(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (collectively, the "Available Insurance Policies"), for any claim,
occurrence or loss exclusively related to the Business that occurred or
existed prior to the Closing Date (to the extent the damages, losses and
liabilities with respect to such claim, occurrence or loss were not taken into
account in connection with the Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.06
and do not relate to the Retained Distribution) (collectively, the "Pre-
Closing Occurrences") or (ii) with respect to any Pre-Closing Occurrences that
are properly reported under the Available Insurance Policies prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ that such claims under the Available
Insurance Policies shall be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations
of the relevant Available Insurance Policy and this Agreement, except to the
extent otherwise mandated by Applicable Law. For the sake of clarity, the
Available Insurance Policies shall not include any matching deductible
policies or other self-insurance policies or programs of Seller or any of its
Affiliates. Buyer shall procure all contractual and statutorily obligated
insurance for the Business as of Closing.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, (x) Seller will be responsible for the
Claims Administration with respect to claims of Seller under the Available
Insurance Policies and (y) the Business and Buyer will be responsible for the
Claims Administration with respect to claims of the Business under the
Available Insurance Policies. Any claims for Pre-Closing Occurrences under the
Available Insurance Policies are subject to and conditioned upon the
following:

  



  

(i) The Business or Buyer shall be solely responsible for notifying all
insurance companies of such Pre-Closing Occurrences and complying with all
policy terms and conditions for pursuit and collection of such Pre-Closing
Occurrences, and the Business and Buyer shall promptly notify Seller's
corporate insurance department of any such claims. Neither the Business, Buyer
nor any of their Affiliates shall, without the written consent of Seller,
amend, modify or waive any rights of Seller or other insureds under
any Available Insurance Policy. The Business and Buyer shall exclusively
bear and be liable (and Seller shall have no obligation to repay or reimburse
the Business, Buyer or any of their Affiliates) 

  



    

56

 



    

for all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible amounts relating to
or associated with all such Pre-Closing Occurrences;

  



  

(ii) With respect to claims for Pre-Closing Occurrences, each party
hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the benefit of the Available Insurance Policies
and pay such benefit, if any, to Buyer (net of any Recovery Costs incurred by
Seller or its Affiliates as a result of the same); _provided_ that Buyer
agrees to reimburse Seller promptly upon request for all out-of-pocket costs
or expenses incurred by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in connection with
making or pursuing any claim pursuant to this Section 5.12, including the
costs of filing a claim and any deductibles or other amounts that are
or become payable by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller as a result of claims
made pursuant to this Section 5.12 (such costs and expenses referred to in
this clause (ii), "Recovery Costs"). The parties agree that any recoveries
under the Available Insurance Policies pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall
inure first to Seller to reimburse all Recovery Costs that have not
already been reimbursed; and

  



  

(iii) Each party hereto agrees to provide reasonable assistance to, and
cooperate with, such party or its Affiliates with respect to the
Claims Administration referred to in the first sentence of this Section
5.12(b). None of Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees shall have any liability,
whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise, to any Person
for or in connection with the provision of such assistance or cooperation. All
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by either party or its Affiliates in
providing any such assistance or cooperation shall be reimbursed promptly by
the other party or its Affiliates.

  



  

Section 5.13. _Retained Distribution_. (a) From and after the Closing, Buyer
agrees that Seller shall have the sole right to claim and collect any amounts
that may be distributed to Seller as a claimant or class member in connection
with a proposed settlement (the "Proposed Settlement") that has been
submitted for approval to the court in an action entitled _In re Payment Card
Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation_ , MDL 1720 (MKB)
(JO) (the "Retained Distribution"). Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including the Companies) agrees that it shall promptly pay to
Seller any amounts that Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Companies),
may receive with respect to the Retained Distribution. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all steps
necessary, including executing any assignment or other agreement in a form
and substance satisfactory to Seller, to assign any payment or distribution it
receives on account of the Retained Distribution to Seller or one of its
Affiliates, as designated by Seller.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Proposed Settlement is approved by the court,
and without limiting the generality of Section 5.04(b), after the Closing,
Buyer shall cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates in the preparation of any
claim or other documentation required to effectuate payment of the Retained
Distribution to Seller, including (i) making available to Seller and its
Affiliates pertinent records, materials and information in Buyer's, the
Companies' or their respective Affiliates' possession or

control relating thereto as reasonably requested by Seller or its Affiliates,
including by making the Company Employees available at reasonable times to
provide information, discovery documentation, take depositions and testify;
and (ii) otherwise providing any assistance reasonably requested by Seller or
its Affiliates relating to the Retained Distribution. Each of Seller and
Buyer shall take all reasonable precautions so as not to jeopardize any

Retained Litigation without Seller's prior written consent and (B) shall
promptly pay to Seller any amounts (whether by award of damages or costs,
settlement, insurance or otherwise) that Buyer or its Affiliates (including
the Companies), may receive with respect to the Retained Litigation. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
take all steps necessary, including executing any assignment or other
agreement in a form and substance satisfactory to Seller, to assign any right,
property or asset related to the Retained Litigation to Seller or one of its
Affiliates, as designated by Seller. "Retained Litigation" means any claim
of the Companies with respect to _In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and
Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation_ , MDL 1720 (MKB) (JO) and any related
settlements; and

  



  

(ii) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.13(c)(i), after the
Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Seller and its Affiliates in the prosecution of the Retained Litigation at
Seller's expense, including by (A) making available to Seller and its
Affiliates all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in

Affiliates relating to the Retained Litigation. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall take all reasonable precautions so as not to jeopardize any privilege
reasonably available to Seller or any of its Affiliates. At Seller's
request, Buyer shall enter into a common interest agreement with Seller and
its Affiliates with respect to the Retained Litigation, in a form to be
mutually agreed by the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 5.14. _Financing_. (a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain
the Financing as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (taking into
account the timing of the Marketing Period

  



    

58

 



    

and Section 2.03) and in any event at or prior to the Closing, including
using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect and comply with
its obligations under the Financing Commitment Letters in accordance with the
terms and conditions thereof, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "Debt Financing
Agreements") on terms and conditions no less favorable to Buyer than the term
and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market
flex" provisions applicable thereto), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Buyer in the Financing Commitment Letters and the
Debt Financing Agreements to the fullest extent that they are within its
control, (iv) consummate the Financing (including by instructing the parties
to the Financing Commitment Letters to provide the Financing, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein), at the Closing and (v) enforce
its rights under the Financing Commitment Letters. Upon Seller's request,
Buyer shall furnish true and complete copies of the Debt Financing Agreements
and all other definitive agreements and documents entered into by Buyer prior
to the Closing in relation to the Financing Commitment Letters (including in
respect of any Alternative Financing) to Seller promptly upon their
execution; provided that any fee letters, engagement letters, or other
agreements that, in accordance with customary practice, are confidential by
their terms, and that do not affect the conditionality or amount of the Debt
Financing, may be redacted so as not to disclose such terms that are so
confidential.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall not (i) agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or
other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any Financing
Commitment Letter, any Debt Financing Agreements or any other definitive
agreements or documents related to the Financing or (ii) substitute other
debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same
or Alternative Financing sources, in each case, without Seller's prior
written consent, except, solely in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, to
the extent such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or substitution
would not (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing contemplated (or
otherwise required) to be funded at the Closing (or the cash
proceeds available therefrom) unless such reduction is matched with an equal
increase in the Equity Financing under the Investment Agreement, (B) impose
new or additional conditions precedent to any of the Financing, or adversely
amend, modify or waive any of the existing conditions thereto, or (C)
otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impair the availability
of any of the Financing contemplated (or otherwise required) to be funded at
the Closing or the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Financing Commitment Letters, the Debt Financing Agreements or any
other definitive agreements or documents related to the Financing. Buyer
shall not release or consent to the assignment or termination of the
obligations of any lender or any other Person under the Financing Commitment
Letters, except in connection with any allocation to another lender as
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the substitution of any portion
of the Debt Financing permitted under this Section 5.14(b) or (c). Upon any
such amendment, supplement, modification or substitution of the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with this Section 5.14(b), Buyer shall
provide a copy thereof to Sellers, and references to the "Financing
Commitment Letters" and "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents
as permitted to be amended, supplemented, modified or substituted under
this Section

  



    

59

 



    

5.14(b), and references to the "Financing" and "Debt Financing" shall include
the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be
amended, supplemented, modified or substituted under this Section 5.14(b).

  



  

(c) If for any reason all or any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated to be funded at the Closing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
Buyer shall promptly notify Seller and use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to, alternative debt financing from alternative sources (the
"Alternative Financing") (i) as promptly as practicable, taking into account
the expected timing of the Closing, following the occurrence of such event
(and in any event on or prior to the date on which the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to Section 2.02), (ii) upon terms (including any "market
flex" provisions) no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer than those in
the Debt Commitment Letter and (iii) in an amount sufficient to (A) consummate
the Closing upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement, (B) pay all other
amounts payable by Buyer in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and required to be paid on the
Closing Date and (C) pay all related fees and expenses of Buyer (or, to the
extent required by this Agreement, Buyer's Affiliates, directors, managers,
officers, general or limited partners, employees, counsel, financial
advisors, auditors, agents and other authorized representatives) required to
be paid on the Closing Date. If any Alternative Financing is obtained in
accordance with this Section 5.14(c), Buyer shall promptly notify Seller
thereof and references to the "Debt Financing," "Financing," "Debt Commitment
Letter" and "Financing Commitment Letters" (and other like term in this
Agreement) shall include such Alternative Financing, as applicable.

  



  

(d) Seller shall, and shall cause the Companies to, use their
reasonable best efforts to provide, and cause their respective
Representatives to provide, all customary cooperation as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing (which, for purposes of this Section 5.14(d), shall include any
offering of "high yield" debt securities to be issued or incurred in lieu of
any bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter), including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) furnish Buyer and its Debt Financing
Sources with (A) the Required Information and (B) such other customary
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Companies as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the type of
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof, (ii)
participate in a reasonable number of lender or investor meetings, rating
agency meetings, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, road shows and
sessions with prospective Debt Financing Sources and potential lenders or
investors in the Debt Financing, in each case on reasonable advance notice and
at times and at locations reasonably acceptable to the Companies, including
direct contact between senior management and the other representatives of
the Companies, on the one hand, and the actual and potential Debt Financing
Sources and potential lenders or investors in the Debt Financing, on the
other hand, in each case only to the extent customarily needed for financings
of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof or,
if applicable, "high yield" debt securities in lieu of a portion, (iii)
reasonably cooperate with the syndication and marketing efforts of Buyer and
the Debt Financing

"public" versions thereof), and other similar documents, and identifying any
portion of the information that constitutes material, non-public information,
and execute and deliver customary authorization and representation letters
with respect to the bank information memoranda relating to the Debt
Financing, in each case only to the extent customarily needed for financings
of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof or,
if applicable, "high yield" debt securities in lieu of a portion, (iv) at
least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, furnish all
documentation and other information required under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001, that has been requested by Buyer at least nine
(9) days prior to the Closing Date, (v) take corporate actions reasonably

and liens required to be released or discharged on the Closing Date, and (x)
assist in the preparation of and, in the case of the Companies, to execute
and deliver, definitive financing documents, including guarantee and
collateral documents and customary closing certificates as may be required by
the Financing; _provided_ that the Companies shall not be required to enter
into any such document or instrument contemplated by the foregoing clauses
prior to the Closing; and _provided, further_ , that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (including this Section
5.14),

  



  

(A) nothing in this Agreement (including this Section 5.14) shall
require any such cooperation to the extent that it would:

  



  

(1) require Seller to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or
require Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies at
the Closing) to incur any liability, make any payment or enter into any
Contract,

  



  

(2) require the Companies to (x) agree to pay any commitment or other
fee or reimburse any expenses in connection with the Financing prior to the
Closing or (y) incur any liability or give any indemnity or otherwise commit
to take any action that is not contingent on the Closing,

  



  

(3) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of
Seller or the Companies,

  



   

61

 



     

(4) require Seller or any of the Companies to take any action that

Applicable Law or (z) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of such Person (except, in the case of the Companies, any Lien on any
of its assets that becomes effective only upon the Closing),

  



  

(5) require Seller, any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries (other than
the Companies at the Closing), or their respective directors,
managers, officers, general or limited partners, employees, counsel,
financial advisors, auditors, agents and other authorized representatives to
enter into or approve any Debt Financing Agreement or other definitive
agreement or document related to the Financing,

  



  

(6) result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely
discharge of the duties of Seller's, any of its Affiliates' or the
Companies' directors, managers, officers, general or limited partners,
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors, agents and other authorized
representatives,

  



  

(7) result in any of Seller's or the Companies' respective directors,
managers, officers, general or limited partners, employees, counsel,
financial advisors, auditors, agents and other authorized representatives
incurring any personal liability with respect to any matters relating to the
Financing, or

  



  

(8) cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article 8 to fail to be
satisfied by the End Date or otherwise result in a breach of this Agreement
by Seller,

  



  

(B) no action, liability or obligation of the Companies or their
respective directors, managers, officers, general or limited
partners, employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors, agents and other
authorized representatives under any certificate, agreement, arrangement,
document or instrument relating to the Financing (other than customary
authorization and representation letters delivered pursuant to Section

(C) the parties hereto agree that any information with respect to the
prospects and plans for the Companies' business and operations in connection
with the Financing will be the sole responsibility of Buyer, and none of
Seller, any of its Affiliates, the Companies or their respective
Representatives shall be required to prepare or provide any information or
make any presentations with respect to capital structure, or the incurrence
of the Financing or other _pro forma_ information relating thereto or the
manner in which Buyer intends to operate, or cause to be operated, the
Business after the Closing.

  



  

Seller hereby consents to the customary use of the Companies' corporate logos
in connection with the syndication or marketing of the Debt Financing;
_provided_ , that such

 



  

62

 



     

logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely
to harm or disparage the Seller, the Companies or the reputation or goodwill
of the Seller, the Companies or their marks.

  



  

(e) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates nor, prior to the Closing, the Companies, shall have
any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person under or with
respect to, the Debt Financing or any cooperation provided pursuant to this

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this Section 5.14), (i) Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for
all costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees)
incurred by Seller, its Affiliates or the Companies in connection with the
Financing and/or the arrangement thereof (including the actions and
cooperation contemplated by Section 5.14(d), including, but not limited to,
all such costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation of
audited, consolidated year-end financial statements of the Company for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2019) and (ii) Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller, the Companies and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all damages actually suffered by any of them in
connection with the Financing and/or the arrangement thereof (including any
arising from or relating to the actions and cooperation contemplated by
Section 5.14(d)) or any information used in connection therewith, in each
case, other than to the extent such damages (A) arise from the use of
historical financial information relating to the Companies furnished in
writing by or on behalf of the Company for use in connection with the Debt
Financing or (B) are judicially determined to be the result of the bad faith,
gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of the Seller or any
Company or their respective Representatives.

  



  

(f) Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice of (i) obtaining knowledge of
any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to any Financing Commitment Letter, Debt
Financing Agreement or other definitive agreement or document related to the
Financing, (ii) the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any party to any Financing Commitment Letter, Debt
Financing Agreement or other definitive agreement or document related to the
Financing alleging any actual or threatened breach, default, withdrawal,
termination or repudiation of any provision of such Financing Commitment
Letter, Debt Financing Agreement or other definitive agreement or document
related to the Financing, (iii) any material written dispute or disagreement
between or among Buyer and any of the other parties to any Financing

Financing), (iv) any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, any
Financing Commitment Letter, Debt Financing Agreement or other definitive

other reason that could reasonably be expected to result in Buyer not being
able to timely obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated to be
funded at the Closing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters, Debt Financing Agreements or
other definitive agreements or 

  



    

63

 



    

documents related to the Financing. Upon request by Seller, Buyer shall keep
Seller informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or Alternative Financing in
accordance with Section 5.14(c)).

  



  

(g) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply and to direct
its directors, managers, officers, general or limited partners,
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors, agents and other authorized
representatives to comply, with the terms, and satisfy on a timely basis the
conditions, of the Financing Commitment Letters as set forth in Section
5.14(a).

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) it is
understood and agreed that (A) the condition precedent set forth in Section
8.01(b)(ii) as applied to Sellers' obligations under this Section 5.14 shall
be deemed to be satisfied and (B) Seller shall be entitled to exercise each
of the termination rights applicable to it in Article 9 hereof (subject to the
terms and conditions thereof), in each case, notwithstanding any breach of
this Section 5.14 by Seller, unless Seller's breach of its obligations
under this Section 5.14 is the proximate cause of the Debt Financing having
not been obtained (or of any debt securities to be issued or incurred in lieu
of any bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Financing having not been
obtained), and (ii) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the
Financing is not a condition to Closing.

  



  

(i) All information regarding Seller, the Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates made available to Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.14
shall be kept confidential by Buyer in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.15. _Confidentiality_. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. The parties agree that if this
Agreement is terminated for any reason prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. Seller hereby agrees that it shall not, and
that it shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives who have received
confidential or proprietary information involving or relating to Buyer, its
Affiliates or the Business not to, at any time on or after the Closing,
directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), disclose
any such confidential or proprietary information to any third party for any
purpose whatsoever, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 5.16. _Wrong Pockets_. (a) If, following the Closing, (i) any right,
property or asset exclusive to or primarily belonging to the Business (and
not also for one or more other businesses of Seller and its Affiliates) is
found to have been retained by Seller or any of its Affiliates in error,
Seller shall transfer, or shall cause such Affiliate to transfer, at no cost,
such right, property, or asset (and any related liability) as soon as
practicable to Buyer (or its designated Affiliate); or (ii) any right,
property or asset not exclusive to or not primarily belonging to the Business
is found to have been transferred to Buyer or any of the Companies in error,
Buyer shall transfer, or shall cause the applicable Company to transfer, at no
cost, such right, property or asset (and any related liability) as soon as
practicable to Seller (or its designated Affiliate); _provided_ , that in the

  



    

64

 



    

case of either clause (i) or (ii), until any such transfer is completed, the
parties hereto shall cooperate to structure alternative arrangements
reasonably acceptable to the parties hereto under which Seller, on the one
hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, as applicable, would obtain the
benefits and assume the obligations of the relevant right, property, or asset
in accordance with this Agreement as if the relevant transfer had taken
place. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall transfer, or shall cause such
Affiliate to transfer all licenses related to PTC/Creo software engineering
used by the Business to the Companies. The parties hereto shall reasonably
cooperate with each other in connection with the transfers contemplated by
this Section 5.16. In addition, Seller shall, or shall cause its
applicable Affiliates to, promptly pay or deliver to Buyer (or its designated
Affiliate) any invoices, notices, monies or checks that have been sent to
Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date by customers, suppliers
or other contracting parties of the Business to the extent that they
primarily relate to or are due to or from the Business.

  



  

(b) Each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
(i) treat for all Tax purposes the rights, property, or assets described in
(a)(i) as having been transferred to and owned by the Person entitled to such
assets as having been transferred to and owned by Buyer at the Closing, (ii)
treat for all Tax purposes the rights, property, or assets described in
(a)(ii) as having remained with Seller, and (iii) neither report nor treat
any Tax position (on a Tax Return or otherwise) inconsistent with such
treatment (unless, in case of clause (i), (ii) or (iii), otherwise required
by Applicable Law).

  



  

Section 5.17. _Restrictive Covenants_. (a) Subject to Section 5.17(d) in all
respects, Seller agrees that for a period of three (3) years after the
Closing Date (the "Non-Competition Period"), Seller shall not and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control,
or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or
otherwise engage in, any Competing Business anywhere in the United States.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 5.17 shall prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates during the Non-
Competition Period from: (i) collectively owning less than five percent (5%)
of the outstanding shares of any class of capital stock of any Person that
engages in a Competing Business, (ii) owning any publicly traded securities
through a Company Benefit Plan operating in the ordinary course of business,
(iii) performing obligations required under this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents or (iv) the acquisition by Seller or any of its Affiliates of a
diversified company having not more than 25% of its net sales (based on its
latest published annual audited financial statements) attributable to a
Competing Business.

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 5.17(d) in all respects, neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates will (i) at any time prior to the date that is
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date (the "Non-Solicitation Period"),
directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any Company Employee or
consultant performing services (whether as an employee, consultant,
independent contractor or otherwise) for the Companies or the Business who is
set forth in Section 5.17(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to leave
the employment or retention of the Companies, without Buyer's prior written
consent or (ii) at any time prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Closing Date, hire in any capacity (whether as an employee, consultant,
independent contractor or otherwise) any of the

  



    

65

 



    

employees set forth in (b), of the Seller Disclosure Schedule unless (x) such
employee has been terminated by Buyer, the Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates or (y) the employment of such employee by Buyer, the
Companies or their respective Affiliates has otherwise terminated at
least six (6) months prior to the date of such hire, without Buyer's prior
written consent. For purposes of Section 5.17(b)(i), the terms "solicit the
employment or services" shall not be deemed to include generalized searches
for employees through media advertisements of general circulation, employment
search firms, open job fairs or otherwise that are not directed at the Company
Employees.

  



  

(c) Each of Seller and Buyer expressly agrees that the character,
duration and scope of this Section 5.17 are reasonable in light of
the circumstances as they exist on the date hereof, including, but not
limited to, its material economic interest in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent
jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment determines that any of the
covenants and agreements contained in this Section 5.17, or any part thereof,
is unenforceable because of the character, duration or scope of such covenant
or agreement, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or scope
of such covenant or agreement solely to the extent required or permitted by
Applicable Law to permit the enforceability of such covenant or agreement
and, in its reduced form, such covenant or agreement shall then be enforceable
to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law. Each party hereto
acknowledges that money damages would be an insufficient remedy for any actual
or threatened breach of this Section 5.17 and in addition to any other
remedies available at law or in equity, the non-breaching party will be
entitled to seek equitable relief by way of injunction, specific performance
or otherwise, without posting any bond or other undertaking, for any actual
or threatened breach of this Section 5.17.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing that may be deemed to the
contrary, in no event shall any of the restrictions set forth in (i) this
Section 5.17 apply in any respect to any acquirer of Seller or any ultimate
parent of Seller or any of such acquirer's other Affiliates (or, in any
business combination transaction involving Seller or any ultimate parent of
Seller, the counterparty to that transaction or any of its Affiliates) and
(ii) Section 5.17(a) apply in any respect to the existing businesses of Seller
and its Subsidiaries or the currently contemplated business line expansion
set forth on Section 5.17(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

Section 5.18. _Assistance with Financial Statements_. (a) For a period of two
(2) years following the Closing, and at the sole expense of Buyer, Seller
shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, use its and their
commercially reasonable efforts to upon reasonable advance notice, (i)
provide to Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Companies) and their
respective Representatives such pre-existing information regarding the
Business as is already in Seller's possession and is reasonably necessary for
Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Companies) and their respective
Representatives to prepare the Financial and Other Information (as defined
below) and (ii) afford Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Companies)
and their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the business of
Seller and its Affiliates to the respective books and records relating to the
Business for the time periods covered by the financial statements referred

  



    

66

 



    

to in the definition of Financial and Other Information and to the then-
current personnel of Seller and its controlled Affiliates responsible for
such books and records. For this purpose, "Financial and Other
Information" means, solely to the extent required to (i) prepare a
registration statement on Form S-1, (ii) to meet any other form
requirement of the Securities and Exchange Commission or (iii) prepare an
offering memorandum for the sale of debt securities in a Rule 144A and
Regulation S private placement, such historical financial and other
information, relating to the Business as is reasonably necessary for the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Companies) and their respective
Representatives to prepare historical financial statements (including audited
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP audited to the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) and related financial
reports, notes and/or narrative disclosures that relate to Buyer, the Company
and the Business, for up to the three (3) full fiscal years preceding the
Closing, and for any subsequent interim period for the fiscal year in which
the Closing occurs and the corresponding interim period in the immediately
preceding fiscal year, which may include stand-alone financial statements and
other financial and related narrative information (including a
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations) of the Business for one or more of such periods.

  



  

(a) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all
damages actually suffered by any of them relating to the actions and
cooperation contemplated by Section 5.18(a) or any information used in
connection therewith, in each case, other than to the extent such damages are
judicially determined to be the result of the bad faith, gross negligence,
fraud or intentional misconduct of the Seller or its Affiliates.

  



  

Article 6 
 Employee Matters

  



  

Section 6.01. _Continued Employment of Company Employees_. Except for the
Excluded Individuals, prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to
make offers of employment to any person set forth on the Employee List (as it
may be updated in accordance with Section 3.18 hereof) who is employed by a
Person (other than one of the Companies), with any such offer to be effective
as of the Closing, and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither the
acceptance of such offer(s) nor the transfer(s) of such individuals to become
employees of the Company shall be construed as a condition to Closing. The
Company Employees (including any Company Employee (a) who is not actively
working on the Closing Date as a result of an approved leave of absence and/or
(b) whose employment is transferred to the Company pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence), are referred to collectively herein as the
"Continuing Employees." Each Company Employee shall continue employment with

Subsidiaries shall be responsible for providing benefits, and bearing all
costs, in respect of claims incurred under a Seller Welfare Plan for
Continuing Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents prior to the

Plans; and

  



  

(b) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for the dollar amount

account plan established or designated by Buyer, and subject to the
Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for the obligations

schedule which shall, as of the Closing Date, set forth a list of each
employee employed by a Company, Seller or a Retained Subsidiary whose
employment has been terminated involuntarily within the prior 90-day period
and

and (b) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, cause a
Buyer DC Plan to accept a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer of the full value

("Employee Accounts") from the Seller DC Plans. When conducting the trustee to
trustee transfer from the Seller DC Plans to the Buyer DC Plan, Seller and
Buyer will cooperate with respect to the asset mapping or in-kind transfer
(as applicable), including the liquidation of the Masco Stock Fund held in
Employee Accounts and subsequent investment of these funds into the qualified
default investment option of the Buyer DC Plan. During the Continuation

participated in the Seller DC Plan and who continues deferrals in the Buyer

Plan receives such matching contributions.

year in an amount equal to (a) in the event Buyer elects to continue the
applicable Seller Incentive Plan for any Continuing Employee, a cash bonus
amount payable under the applicable Seller Incentive Plan based on the actual
achievement of the applicable performance criteria for such fiscal year or

  



    

70

 



    

(b) in the event Buyer elects for any Continuing Employee, with respect to the

Reference Time occurs, to establish new annual cash incentive programs for
such Continuing Employee or provide for such Continuing Employee to
participate in an existing Buyer annual cash incentive plan (each, a "Post-
Closing Bonus Plan"), a cash amount equal to the sum of (i) the cash amount
payable under the applicable Seller Incentive Plan based on actual
achievement of the applicable performance criteria for such fiscal year
through the Closing Date, with such amount prorated based on the number of
completed days in the performance year through the Closing Date  _plus_ (ii)
the cash amount payable under the applicable Post-Closing Bonus Plan in
accordance with its terms, with such amount prorated based on the number of
completed days in the performance year following the Closing Date. Such Seller
Incentive Plans shall be maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the
Company) and such Annual Bonus amounts shall be paid by Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Company), subject to the terms of the applicable
Seller Incentive Plan and any applicable proration (as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence), less any required withholding Taxes, on the
date on which Buyer would normally pay bonuses. Any portion of an Annual
Bonus payable under a Post-Closing Bonus Plan will be paid in accordance with
the terms thereof. Promptly following the end of the year in which the
Reference Time occurs, Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company)
shall implement an annual bonus program covering the remaining portion of the
Continuation Period in accordance with its obligations under Section 6.01. To
the extent the Reference Time does not occur in 2019 and as of the date the

generality of Section 10.07, nothing in this Article 6, express or implied,
by itself or in conjunction with any other act, (a) is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto, including any Company
Employee, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, (b) shall establish, or constitute an amendment,
termination or modification of, or an undertaking to amend,
establish, terminate or modify, any Employee Benefit Plan or (c) shall create
any obligation on the part of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective

following Closing.

  



  

Section 6.12. _Stop Loss Coverage_.

  



  

(a) As soon as administratively feasible following the written request
of Buyer, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase, to
the extent reasonably available in the market, a stop loss coverage insurance
policy providing coverage to Seller with regard to benefits provided under
the health and welfare Employee Benefit Plans of Seller for participants and
beneficiaries whose coverage under such plan is on account of services
provided to the Company, upon such terms (including attachment levels and
early termination procedures) reasonably requested by the Buyer and subject

expenses incurred by Seller in connection with obtaining the Stop Loss
Coverage shall be paid by the Buyer. Any payments made to Seller under the

under Section 6.04 in furtherance of Buyer's obligations to provide benefits
coverage under such Section 6.04.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) it is
understood and agreed that (A) the condition precedent set forth in Section
8.01(b)(ii) as applied to Sellers' obligations under this Section 6.12 shall
be deemed to be satisfied and (B) Seller shall be entitled to exercise each
of the termination rights applicable to it in Article 9 hereof (subject to the

case, the right to

  



    

77

 



    

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(a)(ii) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results
in the failure of the Closing to have occurred by such time;

  



  

(iii) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing would violate any non-
appealable, final injunction or order of any court of competent
jurisdiction, in the United States;

  



  

(iv) by Buyer if there is any material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this
Agreement, such that the conditions specified in Section 8.01(b)(i) or Section
8.01(b)(ii) would not be satisfied at the Closing (a "Terminating Seller
Breach"), except that, if such Terminating Seller Breach is curable by Seller,
then, for a period of up to 30 days after receipt by Seller of notice from
Buyer of such breach (the "Seller Cure Period") such termination shall become
effective only if the Terminating Seller Breach is not cured by the earlier of
(A) the end of the Seller Cure Period, and (B) the End Date;

  



  

(v) by Seller if there is any material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement, such that the conditions specified in Section 8.01(c)(i) or Section
8.01(c)(ii) would not be satisfied at the Closing (a "Terminating Buyer
Breach"), except that, if any such Terminating Buyer Breach is curable by
Buyer, then, for a period of up to 30 days after receipt by Buyer of notice
from Seller of such breach (the "Buyer Cure Period"), and such termination
shall become effective only if the Terminating Buyer Breach is not cured by
the earlier of (A) the end of the Buyer Cure Period, and (B) the End Date; or

  



  

(vi) by Seller if (1) the Marketing Period has ended and all of the
conditions set forth in Sections 8.01(a) and 8.01(b) have been satisfied or
waived (other than (x) those conditions which by their terms or nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing but which are capable of being satisfied at such
time if the Closing were to occur at such time and (y) those conditions the
failure of which to be satisfied is caused by or results from a breach by
Buyer of this Agreement), (2) Seller has given written notice to Buyer that
all of the conditions in Section 8.01(c) have been satisfied or waived (other
than (x) those conditions which by their terms or nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing but which are capable of being satisfied at such time if the
Closing were to occur at such time and (y) those conditions the failure of
which to be satisfied is caused by or results from a breach by Buyer of this
Agreement) and that it is ready, willing and able to take the actions within
its control to consummate the Closing, (3) Buyer has failed to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or prior to the date on which
the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.03 and (4) Seller
shall have provided written notice on or after such date of its intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(a)(vi) to Buyer at
least three Business Days prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to
this Section

  



    

78

 



    

9.01(a)(vi), and Buyer shall not have consummated the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on such third
Business Day.

  



  

(b) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.01(a)(ii), 9.01(a)(iii), 9.01(a)(iv), 9.01(a)(v) or 9.01(a)(vi) shall give
written notice of such termination to the other party.

  



  

Section 9.02. _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in
Section 9.03, if this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 9.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no
liability on the part of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or Representative of such party) to the other
party to this Agreement; _provided_ that the provisions of Sections 1.01 (
_Definitions_ ), 5.07 ( _Public Announcements_ ), Section 5.09(d) (
_Sufficient Funds for Payment of the Termination Fee_ ) 5.14(e) ( _Financing_
), 9.02 ( _Effect of Termination_ ), 9.03 ( _Termination Fee and Related
Matters_ ) and Article 10 ( _Miscellaneous_ ) (other than Section 10.02 (
_Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ) and 10.10(b) and 10.10(c) ( _Special
Indemnity_ )) shall survive any such termination; _provided_ , _further_ that
the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve Seller from liability for
any intentional, willful and material breaches of this Agreement prior to the
date of such termination.

  



  

Section 9.03. _Termination Fee and Related Matters_. (a) If this Agreement is
validly terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(v) or
Section 9.01(a)(vi) (or by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section
9.01(a)(ii)(A), in each case in this parenthetical, at a time when Seller had
the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(v) or Section
9.01(a)(vi) (in each case, without giving effect to any notice requirement or
cure period or right set forth therein)), then Buyer shall pay to Seller an
amount in cash equal to $50,000,000 by wire transfer in immediately available
funds (the "Termination Fee") within five (5) Business Days of such
termination (or, in the case of any such termination by Buyer pursuant to
Section 9.01(a)(ii), prior to or concurrently with and as a condition
precedent to such termination), it being understood that in no event shall
Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once. Each of the
parties hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates,
successors and assigns, that (x) the liabilities and damages that may be
incurred or suffered by Seller in circumstances in which the Termination Fee
is payable are uncertain and difficult to ascertain, (y) the Termination Fee
represents a reasonable estimate of probable liabilities and damages incurred
or suffered by Seller in these circumstances, and (z) such amount is not
excessive or unreasonably large, given the parties' intent and dealings with
each other, and shall not be argued by any party to be or be construed as a
penalty, and each party expressly waives any right to argue, assert or claim
any of the foregoing in any dispute among the parties and/or any of their
respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, arising out of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to Section 9.01(a) and (ii) the Termination Fee is payable under Section
9.03, (A) Seller's receipt of the Termination Fee in full shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Seller against Buyer and its respective former,
current and future directors, managers, officers, and employees, the Equity
Financing Source, Debt Financing Sources and their respective directors,

  



    

79

 



    

officers, employees, agents, attorneys, advisors, representatives, Affiliates
and managers, counsel, financial advisors, auditors, agents, other authorized
representatives, stockholders, Affiliates and assignees (collectively, but
excluding Buyer, the "Buyer Related Parties") for any damages suffered as a
result of the failure of the Closing to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder, and neither Buyer nor any Buyer Related Party
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) the amount of
the Termination Fee is intended to serve as a cap on the maximum aggregate
liability of Buyer and the Buyer Related Parties in the event of such a
termination; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of
Seller or the Companies to recover reimbursement for costs and expenses or
indemnification under Section 5.14(e) or reimbursement for costs and expenses
or interest pursuant to Section 9.03(c), and any such
reimbursement, indemnification or interest shall not reduce the amount of the
Termination Fee; and _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Section
9.03(b) shall restrict Seller's entitlement to seek and obtain specific
performance hereunder as and to the extent permitted by Section 10.13 prior
to the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
9.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, Seller would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 9.03, it shall also pay any costs and expenses
incurred by Seller in connection with enforcing this Agreement (including by
legal action), together with interest on the amount of such unpaid fee, costs
and expenses, at a rate per annum equal to 8% from the date such fee, cost or
expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

or to such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter
specify for the purpose by notice to the other party hereto. All such notices,
requests and other communications shall be deemed received on the date of
receipt by the recipient thereof if received during Working Hours in the place
of receipt. Otherwise, any such notice, request or communication shall be
deemed to have been received on the next succeeding business day in the
place of receipt.

  



  

Section 10.02. _Seller Disclosure Schedule_. Seller has set forth information
on the Seller Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to
the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other
section so long as its relevance to such other section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on
the face of the information disclosed therein to the Person to which such
disclosure is being made. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the
Seller Disclosure Schedule may include certain items and information solely
for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and (b) the disclosure
by Seller of any matter in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed
to constitute an acknowledgment by Seller that the matter is required to be
disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

  



  

Section 10.03. _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. No party hereto may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of the other party hereto; _provided_ , that
Buyer, without the written consent of Seller, may (a) assign this Agreement
to any subsequent acquirer of Buyer or the Business (by merger, consolidation,
sale of stock or assets or otherwise) or (b) collaterally pledge or assign
its rights hereunder to its Debt Financing Sources or an agent thereof as
collateral security in connection with the Debt Financing.

  



  

Section 10.04. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  



  

Section 10.05. _Amendment and Waiver_. (a) Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in
writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and Seller, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

  



  

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall impair such right or remedy or operate or be
construed as a waiver or variation thereof or preclude its exercise at any
subsequent time nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right,
power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

  



    

82

 



    

(c) Except as set forth in Section 10.10(e) and Section 10.10(f), the
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by law.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of this Section 10.05 or
Sections 9.03(b), 10.07, 10.08, 10.12(b), 10.14, 10.15 or 10.16
(collectively, the "DFS Provisions") may be amended or waived in any manner
adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the consent of the Debt
Financing Sources party to the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

Section 10.06. _Costs_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be
paid by the party (including its Affiliates) incurring such cost or expense.
Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates (including after
Closing, the Companies), hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any
rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or similar rights that Buyer
and its Affiliates have or may have with respect to the payment of the
Purchase Price or any other payments to be made by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.07. _Severability_. Each term, provision, covenant and restriction
of this Agreement is severable. If any such term, provision, covenant or
restriction (other than Section 9.03(b)) is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, (a) it shall have no
effect in that respect and the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to
replace it in that respect with a valid and enforceable substitute term,
provision, covenant or restriction (as applicable), the effect of which is as
close to its intended effect as possible; and (b) the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.

  



  

Section 10.08. _Third Party Rights_. Except for Section 5.10, Section
10.05(d), Section 10.09 and Section 10.10(b), no provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations,
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person, other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Debt Financing Source shall be an express third-party beneficiary with
respect to the DFS Provisions to the extent relating to the rights or
obligation of such Debt Financing Source. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Equity Financing Source shall be an express third-party beneficiary with
respect to Sections 9.03(b), 10.08 and 10.16 to the extent relating to the
rights or obligations of the Equity Financing Source.

  



  

Section 10.09. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_. (a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees
to cause the Companies to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest
arising out of or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the
"Post-Closing Representation"), of Seller, or any shareholder, officer,
employee or director of any Company (any such Person, a "Designated Person")
in any matter involving this Agreement or any other agreements

  



    

83

 



    

or transactions contemplated thereby, including any litigation or other
dispute proceeding between or among Buyer or its Affiliates, any Company and
any Designated Person, by Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other legal
counsel currently representing any Company in connection with this
Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby
(whether or not such legal counsel also represented Seller) (the
"Current Representation") as a result of representing the Company prior to
Closing, even though the interests of such Designated Person may be directly
adverse to Buyer or its Affiliates or any Company.

  



  

(b) It is the intention of the parties hereto that all rights to any
attorney-client privilege applicable to communications between Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP and any other legal counsel currently representing any Company in
connection with the Current Representation (whether or not such legal counsel
also represented Seller) (the "Attorney-Client Privilege") shall be
retained (or assigned to Seller to the extent necessary) and controlled
solely by Seller (and not any such Company); _provided_ that the foregoing
waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any communication
not involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated thereby. Accordingly, the Companies shall not have access to any
such privileged communications, or to the files of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP
or any other legal counsel currently representing any Company (whether or not
such legal counsel also represented Seller) in connection with the Current
Representation, from and after the Closing. The Attorney-Client Privilege
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) Seller and its
Affiliates shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to the Current Representation, and the Companies shall not be holders
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any
other legal counsel currently representing any Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Current Representation (whether or not
such legal counsel also represented Seller) constitute property of a client,
only Seller and its Affiliates shall hold such property rights and (iii) with
respect to any privileged attorney-client communications (the
"Privileged Communications") between Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP and any other
legal counsel currently representing any Company in connection with the
Current Representation (whether or not such legal counsel also represented
Seller) prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and the Companies, together with any
of their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, agree that no such
party may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any action
or claim against or involving any of the parties hereto after the Closing.
Except in connection with a dispute with Buyer relating to this Agreement or
any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, Seller shall not
waive Attorney-Client Privilege with respect to the Privileged Communications
without Buyer's consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

  



  

(c) Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies), that in the
event of a dispute between Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, on the one hand,
and any Company, on the other hand, arising out of or relating to any matter
in which Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other legal counsel currently
representing any Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Current Representation jointly represented both (i) Seller and (ii) any
Company,

  



    

84

 



    

if applicable, neither the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of
client confidence, nor any right to any other evidentiary privilege or any
work product doctrine will protect against or prevent disclosure by Davis
Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other legal counsel currently representing
any Company in connection with the Current Representation to Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller of any information or documents developed or shared
during the course of any such joint representation.

  



  

(d) In the event that any third party shall seek to obtain from Buyer
or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any Company) attorney-
client communications involving Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other legal
counsel currently representing any Company in connection with the Current
Representation, then Buyer shall, to the extent permissible by Applicable Law,
use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Seller of such application as
soon as reasonably practicable in advance of any hearing on the application to
permit Seller, at Seller's sole cost and expense, to participate in any such
proceedings.

  



  

Section 10.10. _Non-Survival; Special Indemnity; Release; Exclusive Remedy; R
andW Insurance Policy_. (a) The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement shall not survive
the Closing and, except in the case of Actual Fraud, there shall be no
liability in respect thereof, whether such liability has accrued prior to, at
or after the Closing, on the part of any party, its Affiliates, and their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners, members,
advisors or other representatives, except to the extent that any covenants
and agreements by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part at or
after the Closing ("Post-Closing Covenants"), which shall survive in
accordance with their terms;  _provided_ that the covenants set forth in
Section 5.06, Section 5.10(a), Section 5.13 and Article 10 shall survive
indefinitely or until the latest date permitted by Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement,
no party shall, in any event, be liable to the other party for any punitive
or speculative damages or, except to the extent reasonably foreseeable (which
shall not be the case in relation to any of the Special Indemnified Matters),
any damages based on diminution in value, a multiple of EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or of any other
financial metric (in each case, whether trailing, forward or otherwise).

  



  

(b) Effective at and after the Closing, Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer
and its Affiliates against and agree to hold each of them harmless from any
and all damage, loss, liability and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation in connection with any action,
suit or proceeding whether involving a third party claim or a claim solely
between the parties hereto) actually suffered by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates arising out of either of the matters described on Section 10.10(b)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (together, the "Special
Indemnified Matters"). In the event Buyer has a claim for indemnity with
respect to the Special Indemnified Matters, Buyer agrees to give prompt
notice in writing of such claim to Seller. The failure to so notify Seller
shall not relieve Seller of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent
such failure shall have adversely prejudiced Seller. Following such notice,
Seller may, at its own expense, assume and control the defense of any third-
party claim relating to the Specified

  



    

85

 



    

Indemnified Matter, and the parties shall proceed in good faith to negotiate
a resolution of any such claim for indemnification between the parties and, if
not resolved through negotiations, such claim shall be resolved by litigation
in an appropriate court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 10.11.
Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of any such third-party claim and
related proceedings and provide Buyer with copies of all correspondence and
other documents received from the Governmental Authority. No such third-party
claim or proceeding shall be compromised or settled that (x) seeks to impose
injunctive or equitable relief, (y) requires an admission of
criminal liability or criminal wrongdoing on the part of any Company or (z)
does not unconditionally and completely release the relevant Company(ies)
from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such third-party
claim, in each case without the prior written consent of Buyer, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller shall not be
liable for any settlement of any third-party claim relating to the Specified
Indemnified Matters effected without its prior written consent.

  



  

(c) With respect to the matters set forth in Section 10.10(b), Buyer,
on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates (including after Closing,
the Companies), hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights of
set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or similar rights that Buyer and its
Affiliates has or may have with respect to the payment of the Purchase Price
or any other payments to be made by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Agreement. Further, any amounts payable with respect to
the Special Indemnified Matters shall be net of any amounts recovered or
recoverable by Buyer under applicable insurance policies. Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to recover
amounts in respect of the Specified Indemnified Matters under applicable
insurance policies, and if Buyer receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies subsequent to an indemnification payment by Seller, then
Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any payment made or
expense incurred by Seller in connection with providing such indemnification
payment up to the amount received by Buyer, net of any expenses incurred by
Buyer in collecting such amount.

  



  

(d) Effective as of the Closing (but only if the Closing actually
occurs), except in the case of Actual Fraud or for any rights or
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, Buyer,
on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries (including the Companies)
and each of its and their respective past, present and/or future officers,
directors, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers,
management companies, members, advisors, stockholders, equity holders,
controlling Persons, other representatives or Affiliates, or any heir,
executor, administrator, successor or assign of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Releasing Parties"), hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally releases and forever discharges Seller and its Affiliates
(excluding the Companies), and each of the foregoing's respective past,
present or future officers, directors, employees, agents, general or limited
partners, managers, management companies, members, advisors, stockholders,
equity holders, controlling Persons, other representatives or Affiliates, or
any heir, executor, administrator, successor or assign of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Released Parties") of and from all actions, causes of
action, suits, proceedings, executions, judgments, duties, debts, dues,
accounts, bonds, Contracts and covenants (whether express or implied), and
claims and demands

  



    

86

 



    

whatsoever whether in law or in equity (whether based upon contract, tort or
otherwise) which the Releasing Parties may have against each of the Released
Parties, now or in the future, in each case in respect of any cause, matter
or thing relating to the Companies, the Business or any actions taken or
failed to be taken by any of the Released Parties in any capacity related to
Companies or the Business occurring or arising at or prior to the Closing.
From and after the Closing and notwithstanding any applicable statute of
limitations, neither Buyer nor the Companies shall, and each of Buyer and the
Companies shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, bring any
action, suit or proceeding against Seller or its Affiliates, whether at law
or in equity, with respect to any of the rights or claims waived and released
by Buyer and the Companies (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereunder.

  



  

(e) Except for the Post-Closing Covenants or in the case of Actual
Fraud, and effective as of the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Releasing Parties, waives any rights and claims Buyer or any of its Releasing
Parties may have against Seller or any Releasing Party of Seller as a result
of actions or omissions at or prior to Closing, whether in law or in equity,
relating to the Interests, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, this waiver and
release does not extend to claims relating to any breach of the other
Transaction Agreements or any of the provisions set forth therein or release
or waive any rights that Buyer or any of its Affiliates, in each case, are
expressly entitled to under this Agreement or such other Transaction
Agreements (including, for the avoidance of doubt, claims for Actual Fraud).
The rights and claims waived by Buyer and its Affiliates include, without
limitation, claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of
or relating to any Environmental Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach
of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other
claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, other than for claims of Actual
Fraud or claims relating to any breach of the other Transaction Agreements,
the Post-Closing Covenants will provide the exclusive remedy for any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement or other
claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Actual Fraud" means the making of
an express representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement; _provided_ that at
the time such representation or warranty was made, (i) such representation or
warranty was inaccurate, (ii) the Person(s) making the representation had
actual knowledge (meaning without imputed or constructive knowledge, and
without any duty of inquiry or investigation) that such representation or
warranty was inaccurate, (iii) in making such representation or warranty the
Person(s) with knowledge of the inaccuracy thereof had the intent to deceive
the party and to induce the other party to enter into this Agreement, and (iv)
the other party acted in reasonable reliance on such representation or
warranty and suffered damages as a result of such reliance. For the sake of
clarity, any Actual Fraud claim brought against any Person shall require
proving each of the elements set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) of the
foregoing sentence with respect to such Person. For the avoidance of doubt,
"Actual Fraud" does not include equitable fraud, promissory fraud, unfair
dealings fraud, or any torts (including fraud) based on negligence or
recklessness.

(g) Buyer agrees that if Buyer or any of its Affiliates obtains or
binds a representations and warranties insurance policy with respect to any
of the representations or warranties set forth in Article 3 of this Agreement
(each, a "RandW Insurance Policy"), each such RandW Insurance Policy shall at all
times provide that: (i) the insurer shall have no, and shall waive and not
pursue all, subrogation rights against Seller or any of its Affiliates,
except for Actual Fraud by Seller, (ii) Seller is a third party beneficiary
of such waiver and (iii) Buyer shall have no obligation to pursue any claim
against Seller in connection with any damage, loss, liability or expense.

  



  

Section 10.11. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, and by each party on separate counterparts. Each
such counterpart shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each
party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement
or other communication). Delivery of a counterpart hereof by e-mail
attachment shall be an effective mode of delivery.

  



  

Section 10.12. _Jurisdiction_ _._  (a) The parties hereto agree that, except
as set forth in Sections 2.06 and 10.12(b), any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate
court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court
of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
federal court within the State of Delaware), so long as one of such courts
shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or
proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall
be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of
Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in Section 10.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 10.12(a), each party hereto acknowledges
and irrevocably agrees that any proceeding involving any Debt Financing
Source arising out of or in any way relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York (unless the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
in which case, in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York) (together with the appellate courts thereof, the "New

  



    

88

 



    

York Courts"), and each of the parties hereby submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the purpose of any such
proceeding. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert
(i) any objection which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such
litigation in any New York Court, (ii) any claim that any such proceeding
brought in any New York Court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and
(iii) any claim that any New York Court does not have jurisdiction with
respect to such proceeding.

  



  

Section 10.13. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

  



  

Section 10.14. _Specific Performance_. (a) The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties would not have
any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to Section
10.14(b), the parties shall be entitled to equitable relief, including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and/or the Investment Agreement and to specifically enforce
compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and/or the
Investment Agreement by any other party, without proof of actual damages or
otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To the extent
any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an
action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement), the End Date shall automatically be extended
to (i) the 20th Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or
proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding
over such action, suit or proceeding.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
acknowledged and agreed that Seller shall only be entitled to specific
performance against Buyer to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
(including by requiring Buyer enforce the Equity Financing
Source's obligations, and the rights of Buyer, thereunder) and to cause Buyer
to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 2.03 and pay any amounts
that may become due hereunder at the Closing if (i) all of the conditions set
forth in Sections 8.01(a) and 8.01(b) have been satisfied or waived by Buyer
(other than (A) those conditions that by their terms or nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing but which are capable of being satisfied at such
time if Closing were to occur at that time, and (B) those conditions
the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by or results from a breach by
Buyer of this Agreement), (ii) the Debt Financing has been or will be funded
at the Closing subject only to funding of the Equity Financing, (iii) Seller
has given written notice to Buyer that all of the conditions in Section
8.01(c) have been satisfied or waived (other than (A) those conditions which
by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the

  



    

89

 



    

Closing, but which are capable of being satisfied at such time if the Closing
were to occur at such time and (B) those conditions the failure of which to be
satisfied is caused by or results from a breach by Buyer of this Agreement)
and that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded, then
it is ready, willing and able to take the actions within its control to
consummate the Closing, and (iv) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing on or
prior to the date when the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section
2.03.

  



  

(c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller may pursue both a grant
of specific performance under this Section 10.14 and termination of this
Agreement and the payment of the Termination Fee and other amounts payable
pursuant to Section 9.03; _provided_ that in no event shall Seller be
permitted or entitled to receive both (i) a grant of specific performance
resulting in the consummation of the Closing in accordance with the terms
hereof and (ii) the Termination Fee and any other amounts payable pursuant to
Section 9.03. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
prior to the Closing or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 9.01 (and seeking payment of the Termination Fee, to the extent
payable), Seller's right to seek to specifically enforce the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.14 is the sole and exclusive remedy of
Seller with respect to any and all matters arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.15. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, INCLUDING IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO A DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER.

  



  

Section 10.16. _Non-Recourse_. Subject to the rights of the parties to the
Financing Commitment Letters, (a) all claims, obligations, liabilities, or
causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out
or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including
any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an
inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and are those
solely of) Persons that are expressly identified as parties in the preamble to
this Agreement ("Contracting Parties"), and (b) no Person who is not a
Contracting Party, including any director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or
representative of, and any financial advisor or Debt Financing Source to, any
Contracting Party, the Equity Financing Source, or any director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, member, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative of, and any financial advisor
or Debt Financing Source to, any of the foregoing ("Nonparty Affiliates"),
shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations,
or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach; and, to the

  



    

90

 



    

maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Contracting Party hereby
waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and
obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 10.16, in no event shall the foregoing
be construed (i) to waive any claim of Buyer or the Companies against the
Debt Financing Sources pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt
Financing Agreements related to the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated thereunder or (ii) to waive any claim of Holdco, Buyer or Seller
against the Equity Financing Source pursuant to the Investment Agreement.
