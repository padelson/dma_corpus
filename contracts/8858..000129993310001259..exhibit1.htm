to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, payment
may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 3.2_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of
cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.   

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided for in this
_Article III_.   

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates on the date that is nine
(9) months after the Effective Time shall, upon demand, be delivered by the
Paying Agent to Parent, and any holder of a Certificate who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, but shall have no greater
rights against Parent than may be accorded to a general unsecured creditor of
Parent under applicable Law.   

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, its Affiliates, Purchaser, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or their respective
Representatives shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior
to the five (5) -year anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any such cash in respect of such Certificate shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.   

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. No investment
loss or other loss incurred by the Exchange Fund shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this _Article III_, and if such loss is
realized Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund to the
extent necessary to satisfy the payment obligations set forth in this
_Article III_.   

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger Consideration
required pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, upon the making by the holder thereof of an affidavit
of such loss, theft or destruction with such assurances as Parent, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger
Consideration, may require of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, and upon posting by such holder of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim in respect
thereof.   

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts that
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.
If and to the extent that amounts so withheld are not paid to a taxing
authority, such amount shall be tendered to the former holder of the shares
of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding
were made by Purchaser.   

3.3 _Stock Options and Other Stock-based Compensation_.   

(a) _Payment for Company Stock Options_. Promptly following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall deliver written notice to each holder of
any option to acquire shares of capital stock of the Company (each, a "

Holder_ ") that is outstanding at such time, which written notice shall inform
each Company Stock Option Holder that (i) all Company Stock Options, whether
or not then vested or exercisable, shall be exercisable as of the Effective
Time by delivery of written notice to the Company of such Company Stock
Option Holders intent to exercise its Company Stock Options and (ii) all
Company Stock Options that remain unexercised as of the Effective Time shall
be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment of consideration of any
kind to the Company Stock Option Holders holding such unexercised Company
Stock Options. The Company shall take all requisite action so that, as of
the Effective Time, (A) each Company Stock Option for which the Company has
received a written notice of intent to exercise from the applicable Company
Stock Option Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the holder of
that Company Stock Option or any other Person, cancelled and converted into
the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by
(y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share
exercise price under such Company Stock Option and (B) each Company Stock
Option that remains unexercised as of the Effective Time shall be cancelled
as of the Effective Time without payment of consideration of any kind to the
Company Stock Option Holder holding such unexercised Company Stock
Option.   

(b) _Payment for Company Stock Awards_. The Company shall take all requisite
action so that, as of the Effective Time, each restricted unit award and
other right, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive shares of Company
Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of such shares, and each award
of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock that may be
held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under any
Company stock award plan, other than Company Stock Options (each, a "
_Company Stock Award_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the holder of that
Company Stock Award or any other Person, cancelled and converted into the
right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of such Company Stock Award multiplied by (y)
the Merger Consideration.   

(c) _Necessary Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions (including
obtaining any employee consents) that may be necessary to effectuate the
provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this _Section 3.3_.   

(d) _Withholding_. All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ shall
be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without
interest.   

(e) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. The Company Stock Plans shall
terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other Company
Employee Plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital
stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the
Company shall terminate and be deleted as of the Effective Time, and
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
following the Effective Time no holder of a Company Stock Option or any
participant in any Company Stock Plan or other Company Employee Plan shall
have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation.   

3.4 _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of
each warrant to purchase shares of capital stock of the Company that is
listed on _Section 3.4_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively,
the " _Warrants_ ") and that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, unless otherwise elected by the holder of any
such Warrant, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to issue a
replacement warrant to each holder thereof providing that such replacement
warrant shall be exercisable for an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
in respect of such Warrant (on an as-converted basis) multiplied by (y) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price
under such Warrant. From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to comply with all of the terms and conditions set
forth in each such replacement warrant, including the obligation to make
the payments contemplated thereby upon exercise thereof.

affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or person, on the other hand or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)). The
Company has adopted a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406(b) of Regulation
S-K, applicable to its principal executive officer, principal financial
officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons
performing similar functions. Since January 1, 2005, there has not been any

Knowledge, there have been no violations of the Companys code of ethics by
its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, persons performing similar
functions, or other senior executive officers. The Company is in compliance
with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules of the NASDAQ Global Market, except
for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.   

(d) _Internal Controls_. Except as described in the 2009 Form 10-K, the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has established and maintains a system
of "internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii)
that receipts and expenditures are executed only in accordance with the
authorization of management and the Company Board and (iii) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Companys and its Subsidiaries assets that could have
a material effect on the Company Financial Statements. Except as described in
the 2009 Form 10-K, no material weakness was identified in managements
assessment of internal controls as of December 31, 2009 (nor has any such

Except as set forth in _Section 4.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company Intellectual Property is free and clear of all Liens or rights of
any other Person to possession or use. To the extent that any
Company Intellectual Property has been developed or created by a Company
Person or any third party for the Company (or one of its Subsidiaries), the
Company (or its applicable Subsidiary) has a written agreement with such
Company Person or third party with respect thereto and the Company (or
its applicable Subsidiary) either (i) has obtained ownership of and is the
exclusive owner of such Intellectual Property by operation of Law or by valid
assignment or (ii) has obtained a license thereto sufficient for the conduct
of its business as currently conducted.   

(c) _Contractual Intellectual Property Rights_. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and consummation of the Merger will not result in the material
breach of, or create on behalf of any other Person the right to terminate or
modify, (i) any Contract relating to any Company Intellectual Property or
(ii) any Contract relating to Third Party Intellectual Property.  _Section
4.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each material
Contract pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been
granted any rights to any (x) Third Party Intellectual Property (except for
any generally commercially available software, including off-the-shelf
Software subject to a shrinkwrap or clickwrap license), or (y)
Company Intellectual Property that has been exclusively licensed to the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries. All of the foregoing contractual
Intellectual Property rights will be available for use by the Surviving
Corporation on substantially similar terms and conditions following the
Closing.   

(d) _Valid Rights; No Infringement By Others_. The Companys ownership of or
rights to all Company Intellectual Property and Third Party Intellectual
Property are subsisting and, to the Companys Knowledge, valid. To the
Companys Knowledge, no other Person is infringing or misappropriating any of
the Company Intellectual Property; and, except as provided in
_Section 4.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
Intellectual Property is not subject to any Proceeding or, to the Companys
Knowledge, any threatened Proceeding, or any outstanding Permit, Contract or
Order restricting in any manner the use, transfer, or licensing thereof by
the Company or its Subsidiaries, or which may materially affect the validity,
use, transfer, licensing or enforceability of such Company Intellectual
Property. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is investigating
any potential infringement or misappropriation of the Company Intellectual
Property.   

(e) _No Infringement By the Company_. To the Companys Knowledge, the
operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as such
business has been or currently is conducted (including products and Software
previously or currently sold, licensed or distributed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) has not and does not infringe(d) or misappropriate(d)
any Intellectual Property right or other right of any third party, or
constitute(d) unfair trade practices under the Laws of any applicable
jurisdiction. Except as set forth on _Section 4.13(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, to the Companys Knowledge, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received any complaint, claim or notice alleging any
such infringement, violation or misappropriation.   

(f) _Protection of Proprietary Rights_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps using reasonable business judgment,
to protect their respective rights in the Company Intellectual Property
(including trade secrets and corresponding rights in
confidential information) and any proprietary information of third parties
provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   

(g) _No Intellectual Property Contracts Affecting Parent_. To the Companys
Knowledge, the Company is not party to any Contract under which any other
Person would be entitled to receive a license or any other right to
Intellectual Property of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) following the Closing.   

4.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.   

(a) _Company Employee Plans; Definitions_. _Section 4.14(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
material Employee Benefit Plans currently maintained, contributed to, or
sponsored, by the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their
ERISA Affiliates and any other material Employee Benefit Plans with respect
to which the Company or its Subsidiaries have contingent or ongoing
liabilities or obligations (together, the " _Company Employee Plans_
").   

(b) _Documentation Relating to Company Employee Plans_. With respect to each
Company Employee Plan, the Company has furnished to Parent a complete and
accurate copy of (i) such Company Employee Plan (or a written summary of any
(A) unwritten plan or (B) Company Employee Plan that is not subject to the
provisions set forth under the Code); (ii) the most recent annual report
(Form 5500) (with respect to those plans for which such form is legally
required) filed with the United States Department of Labor  Employee
Benefits Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, (iii) each
current trust agreement, group annuity contract and summary plan
description, if any, relating to any such Company Employee Plan that is
subject to the provisions set forth in the Code, and (iv) the most recent
financial statements for each Company Employee Plan that is funded.   

(c) _Administration of Company Employee Plans_. Each Company Employee Plan
has been administered in all material respects in accordance with all
applicable Laws (including, where applicable, ERISA and the Code) and the
regulations thereunder and in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and each of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their
ERISA Affiliates has in all material respects met its obligations with
respect to such Company Employee Plan and has made all required contributions
thereto (or reserved such contributions on the Company Balance Sheet). All
filings and reports as to each Company Employee Plan required to have
been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service or to the United States
Department of Labor have been timely submitted. With respect to the Company
Employee Plans, no event has occurred, and there exists no condition or set
of circumstances, in connection with which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries could be subject to any material liability under ERISA, the
Code or any other applicable Law.   

(d) _Benefit Obligations_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to the Company Employee Plans, there
are no benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or
properly accrued as required by such Company Employee Plan or applicable Law,
and there are no benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by
reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP, on the
Company Financial Statements. The assets of each Company Employee Plan which
is funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and records of
such Company Employee Plan if so required under the terms of such Company
Employee Plan or applicable Law.   

(e) _Qualification of Company Employee Plans_. Each Company Employee Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has
received a determination, opinion, or advisory letter, as applicable, from
the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company Employee Plan is
qualified and the plan and trust related thereto are exempt from federal
income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. If
a determination, opinion or advisory letter has been issued with respect to
any Company Employee Plan, such determination, opinion or advisory letter has
not been revoked and revocation has not been threatened, and such Company
Employee Plan has not been amended or operated since the date of its most
recent determination, opinion or advisory letter in any respect, and, no act
or omission has occurred, that, in any case, that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect its qualification. Each Company Employee Plan
that is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of
the Code has been tested for compliance with, and satisfies the requirements
of Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the Code (taking into
consideration any corrective action taken with respect to such test), as the
case may be, for each of the last four (4) consecutive plan years
ending immediately prior to the Closing Date.   

(f) _Absence of Certain Obligations_. Except in the case of a Company
Employee Plan covered by _Section 4.14(k)_ of this Agreement, none of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained a
Company Employee Plan which was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or
Title IV of ERISA. No Company Employee Plan is funded by a
"voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code. No Company Employee Plan holds securities issued by
the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates.   

(g) _Ability to Amend or Terminate_. Except as set forth in _Section
4.14(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company, as applicable, may amend or terminate each Company Employee Plan
sponsored or maintained by the Company or the Subsidiary at any time without
material liability to the Company or the Subsidiary, and any of the Companys
Subsidiaries which are a party thereto may terminate their participation
therein in accordance with the applicable Company Employee Plan documents at
any time without material liability to the Company or is Subsidiary, and
subject to applicable Law. No Company Employee Plan, plan document or
agreement, summary plan description or other written
communication distributed generally to Company Persons, by its terms
prohibits the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating
any Company Employee Plan sponsored or maintained principally by such Company
or Subsidiary, as applicable, in accordance with the Company Employee Plan
document.

its Subsidiaries of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by

guarantee; or (C) providing severance benefits or other benefits after the

included in the determination of such persons "parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Code, without regard to Section 280G(b)(4); or (iii) any
agreement or plan binding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including

accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated
on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. With
respect to any agreement, plan or arrangement identified in _Section
4.14(h)(ii)_ or (iii), the Company has provided to Parent the information
necessary to calculate any excise tax due under Section 4999 of the Code as a

imposed by applicable Law, _Section 4.14(h)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete list of all documents or other instruments
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to make
severance payments, whether pursuant to an Employee Benefit Plan, Contract,
or otherwise. _Section 4.14(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all

contracting entity relating to the right of any such Company Person to

applicable, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have
given notice of intention to terminate the employment of any such officer or

guidance (including, without limitation, proposed regulations,

or such state statute.   

4.15 _Permits_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all Permits
required to conduct their businesses as now being conducted, except for such
Permits the absence of which, individually or in the aggregate, have not
resulted in, and are not reasonably likely to result in, a Material Adverse
Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any Permits of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened,
except for any such suspension or cancellation which would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
all such Permits except for such failures to so comply which, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, a
Material Adverse Effect. To the Companys Knowledge, no such Permit will

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

alleging any violation with respect to, any applicable provision of any Law
with respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of
its properties or assets, except which, individually or in the aggregate, are
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Any Subsidiary of the
Company operating as, or representing itself to be, a minority-owned business
or a woman-owned business possesses a certification of such status and there
are no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened claims or
Proceedings challenging the propriety of such certification or the status
of any such Subsidiary of the Company as a minority-owned or woman-owned
business.   

4.17 _Labor Matters_.

to bargain with any labor union or labor organization, in relation to any
union organizing activity, labor strike, dispute, walkout, work stoppage,
slow-down or lockout involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor

6.2 _Acquisition Proposals_.   

(a) Subject to _Section 6.2(b)_, the Company agrees that, following the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, none of the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
other agents, advisors or representatives (such directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, other agents, advisors
and representatives collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage (including by way of
providing information), facilitate or induce the submission of any inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to
any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide or cause to be provided any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with, or have any discussions with any Person relating to, an actual or
proposed Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise encourage or facilitate any
effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse
or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend,
or publicly announce an intention to approve, endorse or recommend, or,
except for the waivers and releases permitted by clause (v) below, enter
into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar Contract
relating to any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) amend, terminate, waive, release
or fail to enforce, or grant any consent under, any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement that relates to a business combination,
merger or similar transaction involving the Company (provided, that the
Company shall be permitted to grant waivers or releases under any such
agreement solely to permit the counterparty thereto to make a non-public
offer or proposal to the Company Board (or to a special committee of the
Company Board) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall,
promptly after receipt (and in no event later than 24 hours following the
Companys Knowledge thereof, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
following such receipt), advise Parent of the identity of each Person
who makes an actual or proposed Acquisition Proposal or requests a waiver or
release from any such confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement and
the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any Subsidiary of the Company or by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 6.2_ by the Company and also that any breach of clauses (i) through
(v) of this _Section 6.2(a)_ by the Company shall be a material breach of
this Agreement, _provided_ that the foregoing shall have no bearing
on whether any other breach or alleged breach of this _Section 6.2_ is
material. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons
conducted heretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
shall use its (and will cause the Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to use their) commercially reasonable efforts to require the
other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy in accordance with
the terms of such agreement any confidential information previously furnished
by the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives thereunder. The Company shall ensure that its Representatives
and its Subsidiaries Representatives are aware of the provisions of this
_Section 6.2_.   

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.2(a)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company receives an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a
breach of _Section 6.2(a)_ and that the Company Board believes in good faith
to be bona fide and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, prior to the Stockholder Approval
and subject to compliance with the provisions of this _Section 6.2_, (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person (and its Representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person (and its
Representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal (" _Permitted Actions_ ") if the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel, that, as a result of such Acquisition Proposal, the failure to take
such Permitted Action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company will not, and will
not allow its or its Subsidiaries Representatives to, disclose any non-
public information to such Person without entering into one or more
confidentiality agreements with such Person on terms no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company than those contained in the NDA and with
a standstill of duration no shorter than and with exceptions to such
standstill not materially broader than those contained in the NDA, except
that any such standstill may explicitly permit such Person to submit an
Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board (or to a special committee of
the Company Board) at the invitation of the Company Board (or a special
committee of the Company Board) or make a non-public offer or proposal to the
Company Board (or to a special committee of the Company Board) with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to result in a Superior Proposal (" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements_ ")
and will promptly provide Parent with a copy of such fully executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; and provided further that the Company
shall have delivered written notice to Parent at least two (2) Business Days
in advance of taking any action permitted pursuant to subclauses (A) and (B)
of clause (ii) of this _Section 6.2(b)_. The Company shall promptly (and in
no event later than 24 hours following the Companys Knowledge of, but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days after, receipt thereof), and prior to
providing any non-public information to any Person making an Acquisition
Proposal or their Representatives, notify Parent and Purchaser orally and in
writing (which notice shall include the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal and the Person submitting the same) in the event it
receives an Acquisition Proposal (or any communication from a Person that
such Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal) from a Person
or group of related Persons and shall keep Parent and Purchaser reasonably
informed orally and in writing as to the status and any material
developments, discussions and negotiations concerning the same, including
prompt written notice to Parent of any determination by the Company Board (or
any special committee thereof) that a Superior Proposal has been made.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (1) the Company shall
promptly notify Parent and Purchaser orally and in writing if it determines
in accordance with this _Section 6.2(b)_ to begin providing information
or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition
Proposal received from a Person or group of related Persons, and (2) the
Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies of any material non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or such Persons
Representatives that was not previously provided or made available to Parent
and copies of all material documents and written communications relating to
such Acquisition Proposal exchanged between the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives, on the one hand, and
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, on the other hand; provided,
however, Parent shall not have any right to terminate this Agreement or
assert the failure of the closing condition set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_ due
to a failure by the Company to provide Parent such written communications
which are in the form of email and do not relate to the form and amount of
consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to
such Acquisition Proposal, unless the Companys failure to provide such
written communication was willful. The Company shall also provide Parent with
48 hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the
members of the Company Board or any committee thereof) of any meeting of the
Company Board or any committee thereof at which the Company Board or any
committee thereof is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition
Proposal.   

(c) Except as permitted by _Section 6.2(d)_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (i) amend, withdraw,
modify, change, condition or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser, the Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) except as
permitted by _Section 6.2(f)_ , take any other action or make any other
public statement inconsistent with the Recommendation. None of the Company
Board, any committee thereof or the Company itself, shall agree with any
Person to limit or not to give prior notice to Parent or Purchaser of its
intention to effect a Change in Board Recommendation or to terminate this
Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.   

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 6.2(a)(iii)_, _Section 6.2(a)(iv)_ and
_Section 6.2(c)_ , at any time prior to the Stockholder Approval, in response
to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section
6.2_, the Company Board may withdraw, modify, change, condition or qualify
the Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Purchaser (" _Change in
Board Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may
not effect a Change in Board Recommendation pursuant to this _Section
6.2(d)_ (i) unless the Company has complied with this _Section 6.2_, (ii)
until after the fifth (5th) Business Day following actual receipt by Parent
of a Notice of Superior Proposal, (iii) unless either (A) on or before
the expiration of the five (5) Business Day period following the actual
receipt by Parent of the Notice of Superior Proposal referred to in the
foregoing clause (ii), Parent does not make a Matching Bid in response to
such Superior Proposal or (B) following receipt of a Matching Bid within the
five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel and
after taking into consideration the Matching Bid, that the Superior Proposal
to which the Notice of Superior Proposal relates continues to be a Superior
Proposal, and (iv) unless the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to effect a Change in Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Unless the Company Board has
previously effected a Change in Board Recommendation, or is
concurrently therewith withdrawing the Recommendation in accordance with this
_Section 6.2_, and otherwise complies with _Section 6.2(e)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall recommend any Acquisition
Proposal to the stockholders of the Company or, except as otherwise permitted
by this _Section 6.2_, enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger, acquisition or similar agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal.   

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.2_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to
a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.2_,
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(i)_ and concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive
agreement providing for the transactions contemplated by such Superior
Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ , and any purported termination
pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ shall be void and of no force or effect,
unless the Company shall have complied in all material respects with all the
provisions of this _Section 6.2_, including the notification provisions in
this  _Section 6.2(e)_, and with all applicable requirements of _Section
9.3(b)_ (including the payment of the Termination Fee prior to or on the date
of such termination) in connection with such Superior Proposal; and provided
further, however, that the Company shall not exercise its right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_: (A) until after the
second (2nd) Business Day following actual receipt by Parent of written
notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company has received a
Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal and attaching the most current versions of the
definitive agreement, all exhibits and other attachments thereto and
agreements (such as stockholder agreements) ancillary thereto to effect such
Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal
(a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") and stating that the Company intends
to cause the Company to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ (it being understood and agreed that, prior
to any termination pursuant to  _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ taking effect, any
amendment to the price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal
(such amended Superior Proposal, a " _Modified Superior Proposal_ ") shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new two (2) Business Day
period with respect to such Modified Superior Proposal) and (B) unless either
(x) on or before the expiration of the two (2) Business Day period following
the actual receipt by Parent of any Notice of Superior Proposal, Parent
does not make a good faith written proposal (a " _Matching Bid_ ") in
response to such Superior Proposal or (y) following receipt of a Matching Bid
within the two (2) Business Day period, the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel and after taking into consideration the Matching Bid, that the
Superior Proposal to which the Notice of Superior Proposal relates continues
to be a Superior Proposal.   

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, failure
so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or
any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by
_Section 6.2(d)_.   

6.3 _Certain Tax Matters_.   

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) timely prepare and file
(including pursuant to timely filed extensions), consistent with past
practice, all Tax Returns (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") required to be filed,
(ii) timely pay all Taxes due and payable with respect to the taxable periods
covered by such Post-Signing Returns, (iii) accrue a reserve in the books and
records and financial statements of any such entity consistent with past
practice for all Taxes payable by such entity for which no Post-Signing
Return is due prior to the Effective Time, (iv) promptly notify Parent of
any Proceeding pending against or with respect to the Company or any
Subsidiaries in respect of any material Tax and not settle or compromise any
such Proceeding or other action without Parents prior written consent, and
(v) promptly provide to Parent a written copy of any U.S. Federal income tax
Post-Signing Return filed with the Internal Revenue Service.   

(b) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into
or effect any transaction that would result in a material recognition of
income or gain by the Company or any Subsidiary, other than transactions
entered into or effected in the Ordinary Course of Business.

or is reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the business, assets,
liabilities, capitalization, prospects, condition (financial or other), or
results of operations of Parent and/or Affiliates of Parent; or (3) would
impose or result in any material limitation on the ability of Parent
to exercise full rights of ownership with respect to the shares of the
Surviving Corporation following the Closing; or (b) commence or defend any
litigation or Proceeding involving any Governmental Authority.    

(iii) Without expanding its obligations hereunder, the obligation of Parent
and Purchaser to use "reasonable best efforts" under _Section 7.1(a)(i)_ to
obtain waivers, consents and approvals to loan agreements, leases and other
Contracts specifically shall not include any obligation to agree to, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall agree (without the
prior consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld) to, a
modification of the terms of such documents, or to make any guaranty or
monetary payment in consideration of such waiver, consent or
approval.    

(iv) Without prejudice or limitation to the representations, warranties
or covenants in this Agreement, each party acknowledges and agrees that the
issuance of security clearances is in the discretion of the appropriate
Governmental Authorities, and no party shall bear responsibility for the
results of the exercise of such discretion.   

(b) _State Takeover Law_. Without limiting the generality of _Section
7.1(a)_, if any Takeover Law or any state "blue sky" Law shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the
Stockholder Agreements, the Company and the Company Board shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby, and otherwise
act to minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.   

7.2 _Financing_. The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its and their
respective Representatives, including legal and accounting Representatives,
to, provide all commercially reasonable cooperation that is reasonably
requested by Parent in obtaining any financing necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(provided that such requested cooperation does not materially interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries).   

7.3 _Company Stockholder Adoption of the Agreement_.   

(a) _Calling of Company Stockholders Meeting_. The Company shall, acting
through the Company Board, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of obtaining the approval of the principal terms of the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company (the " _Stockholder Approval_ "). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall not be
affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
the withdrawal or modification by the Company Board of its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger.   

(b) _Preparation of Proxy Statement_. The Company shall prepare as soon as
practicable, and file with the SEC within ten (10) Business Days of the date
hereof, a proxy statement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") in accordance with the
Exchange Act and any other applicable Laws, and will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as
promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments to the
satisfaction of the staff and clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC.
The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of
any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information, and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or
its staff, or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect
to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall consult with Parent and its counsel
prior to responding to any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting
there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and
mail to its stockholders and file with the SEC any such amendment or
supplement. The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, to the Companys stockholders prior to
consultation with Parent and consideration in good faith of any comments
submitted by Parent, which comments of Parent shall be accepted so long as
they are reasonable and not in violation of applicable Law.   

(c) _Voting of Shares by Parent and Purchaser_. Parent shall cause all shares
of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Purchaser or any other subsidiary
of Parent to be voted in favor of the approval of the principal terms of the
Merger.   

7.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt written
notice to Parent of (a) the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made
by the Company contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (b) the failure by the Company to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall be deemed to cure any
breach or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Company or waive the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing the Company shall give
written notice to Parent of any of the following within twenty-four (24)
hours of the Companys Knowledge of, and in any event within two (2) Business
Days after, the Companys receipt of notice thereof:    

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;    

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and    

(iii) any Proceedings commenced or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Company or any Subsidiary which, if pending on the date of this Agreement
would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or
which relate to the consummation of the transaction contemplated
hereby.   

Each Party shall promptly provide to the other Party (or its counsel) copies
of all filings made by the filing Party with any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Purchaser, directly
or indirectly, the right to control, direct or interfere with the operations
of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, control and supervision over its business operations. Parent shall
not have any right to terminate this Agreement or assert the failure of the
closing condition set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_ due to a failure by
the Company to deliver notice to Parent under this _Section 7.4_ unless the
Company (x) willfully fails to deliver any such notice or (y) fails to
deliver notice of any event that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to constitute, a Material Adverse Effect.   

7.5 _Access to Information_.   

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and the Companys and such Subsidiaries
Representatives to, afford to Parent and its Representatives access, at all
reasonable times, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of
the Companys and all of its Subsidiaries properties, books, records,
Contracts, commitments and personnel and shall furnish Parent all financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent may request. Unless
otherwise required by Law, Parent will hold any such information which is
non-public in confidence in accordance with the NDA. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, within two (2) Business
Days of any request therefor, provide to Parent the information described in
Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act and any information to which a
holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled under Chapter 13 of the CGCL
(assuming such holder met the requirements of such chapter). The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure for Parent access to and
copies of the work papers of its independent public accountants. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
_Section 7.5_ or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty contained in the Agreement or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, it is understood and agreed to by each party that
(i) any exchange of information under this Agreement shall not affect, in any
way, each partys relative competitive position to the other party or to other
entities, and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries may deny access to any
information if the Company believes, upon advice of outside counsel, that
providing access to such information to Parent and its Representatives would
violate applicable antitrust Laws or any confidentiality agreement or
similar agreement or arrangement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party (which the Company shall use commercially reasonable
best efforts to cause the counterparty thereto to waive).   

(b) The parties acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed the NDA, which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms, except as expressly modified herein.   

(c) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause Deloitte and Touche LLP to allow Parent full and complete
access to its work papers with respect to its audit of the consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2009, and the
related statements of income, cash flows and changes in equity for the fiscal
year then ended.   

7.6 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by Law or applicable stock
exchange rules, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed by
the Company and Parent, and (b) Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing,
and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any other press release with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press
release prior to using such efforts; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this _Section 7.6_ shall be deemed to prohibit any party from making any
disclosure which its counsel deems necessary in order to satisfy such partys
disclosure obligations imposed by Law or stock exchange rules. Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
party before issuing, and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any written communications to Company employees with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger.   

7.7 _Indemnification_.   

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless
(including advancement of expenses) the current and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Covered Parties_ ")
in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
to the fullest extent provided in their respective Articles of Incorporation,
Bylaws or similar governing instruments as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such indemnification shall
be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law.
For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to,
provide for indemnification and exculpation of the Covered Persons in
a manner consistent with and no less favorable than the indemnification and
exculpation provisions with respect to the Covered Persons that are presently
set forth in the Companys and its Subsidiaries Articles of Incorporation,
Bylaws or similar governing instruments. As of the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase a "run-off" directors
and officers insurance and indemnification policy (the " _Run-off D andO;
Insurance_") for the Covered Parties providing coverage for events occurring
prior to the Effective Time for a period not less than six (6) years from the
Effective Time for all persons that are currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy, on terms and
conditions substantially similar to the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance and indemnification policy with a six (6) year aggregate
policy limit of $25 million; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the current annual premium (the " _Current Premium_ ") of
the Companys directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy
as in effect on the date hereof for Run-off DandO; Insurance, and if the cost
of such Run-off DandO; Insurance would exceed three hundred percent (300%) of
the Current Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum
amount of coverage for six (6) years as is available for three hundred
percent (300%) of the Current Premium. If the Run-off DandO; Insurance cannot
be maintained, expires or is terminated or cancelled during such six (6)
-year period, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use
reasonable best efforts to replace such coverage for the remainder of such
period on terms and conditions substantially similar to the existing
directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy; _provided,
however,_ that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend in excess of an aggregate of three hundred (300%) of the Current
Premium to replace the Run-off DandO; Insurance, and if the expense of
replacing such Run-off DandO; Insurance would exceed three hundred percent
(300%) of the Current Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the
maximum amount of coverage for six (6) years as is available for three
hundred percent (300%) of the Current Premium. Subject to applicable Law,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall honor all indemnification
agreements between the Company and the Covered Parties in effect as of the
date hereof.   

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, this _Section 7.7_
shall not be deemed to expand the rights to indemnification to which any
Covered Person was entitled by the Company as of the Effective Time, and in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation have any obligation to
indemnify any of the Covered Persons for any losses or any circumstances
pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ to the extent such Covered Persons would not
have been entitled to such indemnification by the Company if the Merger and
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not been consummated.
Furthermore, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have
any obligation to indemnify any Covered Person if such indemnification is
prohibited by the CGCL or any other applicable Law.   

(b) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary to effect the purposes of this _Section 7.7_, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.7_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of any such assignment by
the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for
all of its obligations under this Agreement. The obligations under this
_Section 7.7_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 7.7_ applies without
the written consent of such affected indemnitee. This _Section 7.7_
shall survive the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Covered Persons,
and shall be enforceable by any of them.   

7.8 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed of
any stockholder litigation against the Company and its directors relating to
this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreements, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no
settlement of any such litigation shall be agreed to without Parents
prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   

7.9 _Waiver of Standstill Provisions_. The restrictions on Parent, Purchaser
and their Affiliates contained in the standstill provisions of the NDA are
hereby waived by the Company but only to the extent reasonably necessary to
permit Parent and Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and/or to comply with their obligations and/or exercise their
legal rights and remedies under this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, such
waiver does not permit the acquisition of the Company (whether by tender
offer, merger, business combination or otherwise) or shares of Company Common
Stock by Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates other than through the
Merger and/or any revised proposal made by Parent pursuant to _Section
6.2_.   

7.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of shares of Company
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock) that are treated as dispositions under such rule and
result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each director
or officer of the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.   

7.11 _Post-Closing Employment Matters_. Subject to _Section 7.11(e)_,
Parent covenants as follows:   

(a) From the Closing Date until its second anniversary, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide each active
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each,
an " _Employee_ ") with salary, bonus opportunities, incentive compensation
opportunities and employee benefits no less favorable in the aggregate
to such Employee than the employee benefits generally provided by Parent or
its Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
from time to time to employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) in the country that is such
Employees principal place of employment who are similarly situated to such
Employee in title, rank, tenure and job duties. Nothing in this _Section
7.11_ shall be deemed to prohibit Parent from, at any time after the
Effective Time, changing the title, rank or job duties of any Employee.   

(b) Subject to the ability to do so under the terms of each Parent Benefit
Plan and applicable law, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan in which
any Employee will participate after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, recognize all
service of the Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, for purposes of eligibility, participation and vesting and, in
the case of any Parent Benefit Plan that provides vacation benefits or any
other form of paid time-off benefits, for purposes of benefit accrual, in
each case subject to the terms of the applicable Parent Benefit Plan
and applicable Law.   

(c) Subject to the ability to do so under the terms of each Parent Benefit
Plan and applicable law, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Employees under
any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in which such
Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date, other than
limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect
to such Employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date
under any welfare benefit plan maintained for the Employees immediately prior
to the Closing Date and (ii) provide each Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Benefit
Plans that are welfare plans in which such Employees are eligible to
participate in after the Closing Date, in each case subject to the terms of
the applicable Parent Benefit Plan and applicable Law.   

(d) If any Employee is terminated from employment by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date and
before the first anniversary of the Closing Date, such Employee shall be
entitled to receive the same severance benefits as are provided by the then-
prevailing severance policies of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to employees who are similarly
situated to such Employee in title, rank, tenure and job duties.   

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.11_ shall (1) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Parent Benefit Plan, (2) give any third party any
right to enforce or confer upon the applicability of the provisions of this
_Section 7.11_ or (3) obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to (A)
maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or
(B) retain the employment of any particular Employee.   

7.12 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Purchaser, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Purchaser, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

the event of such termination, the Company substantially concurrently enters
into such Acquisition Agreement; or    

(ii) if there shall have been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser set forth
in this Agreement such that the conditions to the Closing of the Merger set

satisfied and, in either such case, such breach is incapable of being cured
by the End Date; _provided_  that the Company shall have given Parent at

force or effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company hereunder, except as set forth in this  _Section
9.2_ and _Section 9.3_ and _Article X_, which provisions shall survive such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not relieve any
party for liability for an intentional material misrepresentation or
intentional material breach of this Agreement.

(a) _General_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.3_, each
party shall bear all of the fees and expenses incurred by it in connection

9.1(c)(ii)_, then (x) the Company shall pay the Expenses upon demand and (y)
if concurrently therewith or at any time within twelve (12) months after such
termination the Company enters into a merger agreement, acquisition agreement
or similar Contract (including a letter of intent) with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the

termination, the Company consummates such Acquisition Proposal or enters into
a merger agreement, acquisition agreement or similar Contract with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent, on the
earlier of the date of entry into of such merger agreement, acquisition
agreement or similar Contract or consummation of such Acquisition Proposal,
as the case may be, the Termination Fee;

the Company shall pay the Expenses of Parent upon demand.

9.4 _Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may
amend, modify and supplement this Agreement in any and all respects, whether
before or after any vote of the stockholders of the Company or Purchaser;
_provided_ , _however_ , after approval of this Agreement by the stockholders
of the Company or Purchaser, no such amendment shall be made without
further approval of such stockholders if applicable Law requires such further
approval of such stockholders. Any such amendment, modification or supplement
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and
delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of each of

agreements or conditions of the other parties contained in this Agreement.
The forbearance in any one or more instances of a party to insist upon
performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or
to exercise any right or privilege conferred by this Agreement shall not be
construed as a waiver of any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or
privileges, but the same shall continue and remain in full force and effect
as if no such forbearance or waiver had occurred. The waiver by a party of
any breach of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or
of any right or privilege conferred by this Agreement shall not be construed
as a subsequent waiver of any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or
privileges or as a waiver of any other terms, covenants, conditions, rights
or privileges. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and
signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.   

9.6 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, an amendment, modification or
supplement of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.4_ or an extension or

together with all annexes, appendices, articles, exhibits, schedules hereto
and thereto, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or
among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect
to the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the Exclusivity
Agreement dated February 19, 2010 by and between Parent and the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except as expressly stated otherwise herein,
the NDA shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.   

10.4 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for _Section 7.7_, this Agreement
is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies
upon any other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with

10.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void,
except that Parent and/or Purchaser may assign this Agreement or assign or

Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.   

10.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof
is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.   

10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto
and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need
not sign the same counterpart. Any signature page hereto delivered by
facsimile machine or by e-mail (including in portable document format (pdf),
as a joint photographic experts group (jpg) file, or otherwise) shall be
binding to the same extent as an original signature page, with regard to any
agreement subject to the terms hereof or any amendment thereto. Any party who
delivers such a signature page agrees to later deliver an original
counterpart to any party who requests it.   

10.8 _Governing Law_. The formation, construction, and performance of this
Agreement, including the rights and duties of the parties hereunder, shall be
construed, interpreted, governed, applied and enforced in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements entered into and
performed entirely therein by residents thereof, without regard to
any provisions relating to conflicts of laws among different jurisdictions,
except that the provisions of the CGCL applicable to the Merger shall
apply.   

10.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and
the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party(ies) hereto or
its successors or assigns may be brought and determined in the Courts in the
States of Arizona, California and Delaware. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself
and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and
the rights and obligations arising hereunder (i) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to validly serve process, (ii) any claim that
it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iii) to the fullest
extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (x) the suit, action
or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or (z) this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.   

10.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.
