Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this

represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into
which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(a)</U>. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the

transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided for in this <U>Article&nbsp;III</U>.

Effective Time shall, upon demand, be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent, and any holder of a
Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this <U>Article&nbsp;III</U> shall thereafter look

any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to

which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority), any such cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to

information, and (y)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company&#146;s internal controls over financial reporting.

meaning assigned to such terms in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 2, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement. The audit committee of the Company Board includes an

efforts to require the other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy in accordance with the
terms of such agreement any confidential information previously furnished by the Company, the
Company&#146;s Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives thereunder. The Company shall
ensure that its Representatives and its Subsidiaries&#146; Representatives are aware of the provisions

broader than those contained in the NDA, except that any such standstill may explicitly permit such
Person to submit an Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board (or to a special committee of the
Company Board) at the invitation of the Company Board (or a special committee of the Company Board)

from a Person that such Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal) from a Person or
group of related Persons and shall keep Parent and Purchaser reasonably informed orally and in
writing as to the status and any material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning the
same, including prompt written notice to Parent of any determination by the Company Board (or any

previously provided or made available to Parent and copies of all material documents and written
communications relating to such Acquisition Proposal exchanged between the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, on the other hand; provided, however, Parent shall not have any right to
terminate this Agreement or assert the failure of the closing condition set forth in <U>Section
8.2(b)</U> due to a failure by the Company to provide Parent such written communications which are
in the form of email and do not relate to the form and amount of consideration to be paid to the
holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to such Acquisition Proposal, unless the Company&#146;s failure
to provide such written communication was willful. The Company shall also provide Parent with 48
hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board
or any committee thereof) of any meeting of the Company Board or any committee thereof at which the
Company Board or any committee thereof is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;For six (6)&nbsp;years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will,
jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless (including advancement of expenses) the current
and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the &#147;<B><I>Covered Parties</I></B>&#148;) in
respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent
provided in their respective Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or similar governing instruments as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that such indemnification shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law. For a period of six (6)
years following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of its Subsidiaries to, provide for indemnification and exculpation of the Covered Persons in a
manner consistent with and no less favorable than the indemnification and exculpation provisions
with respect to the Covered Persons that are presently set forth in the Company&#146;s and its
Subsidiaries&#146; Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or similar governing instruments. As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase a &#147;run-off&#148; directors&#146; and
officers&#146; insurance and indemnification policy (the &#147;<B><I>Run-off D&O Insurance</I></B>&#148;) for the Covered

than six (6)&nbsp;years from the Effective Time for all persons that are currently covered by the
Company&#146;s directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance and indemnification policy, on terms and conditions
substantially similar to the Company&#146;s existing directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance and
indemnification policy with a six (6)&nbsp;year aggregate policy limit of $25&nbsp;million; <I>provided</I>,
<I>however</I>, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premium (the &#147;<B><I>Current Premium</I></B>&#148;) of the Company&#146;s
directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance and indemnification policy as in effect on the date hereof for
Run-off D&O Insurance, and if the cost of such Run-off D&O Insurance would exceed three hundred
percent (300%) of the Current Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount
of coverage for six (6)&nbsp;years as is available for three hundred percent (300%) of the Current
Premium. If the Run-off D&O Insurance cannot be maintained, expires or is terminated or cancelled
during such six (6) -year period, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use reasonable
best efforts to replace such coverage for the remainder of such period on terms and conditions
substantially similar to the existing directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance and indemnification
policy; <I>provided, however, </I>that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
in excess of an aggregate of three hundred (300%) of the Current Premium to replace the Run-off D&O
Insurance, and if the expense of replacing such Run-off D&O Insurance would exceed three hundred
percent (300%) of the Current Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount
of coverage for six (6)&nbsp;years as is available for three hundred percent (300%) of the Current
Premium. Subject to applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall honor all
indemnification agreements between the Company and the Covered Parties in effect as of the date
hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, this <U>Section&nbsp;7.7</U> shall not be
deemed to expand the rights to indemnification to which any Covered Person was entitled by the
Company as of the Effective Time, and in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation have
any obligation to indemnify any of the Covered Persons for any losses or any circumstances pursuant
to this <U>Section&nbsp;7.7</U> to the extent such Covered Persons would not have been entitled to such
indemnification by the Company if the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
had not been consummated. Furthermore, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
obligation to indemnify any Covered Person if such indemnification is prohibited by the CGCL or any
other applicable Law.

consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)&nbsp;transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary to effect the purposes of this <U>Section&nbsp;7.7</U>, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in
this <U>Section&nbsp;7.7</U>; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that, in the case of any such assignment by the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for all of its obligations
under this Agreement. The obligations under this <U>Section&nbsp;7.7</U> shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this <U>Section&nbsp;7.7</U>
applies without the written consent of such affected indemnitee. This <U>Section&nbsp;7.7</U> shall
survive the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Covered Persons, and shall be enforceable by
any of them.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">7.8 <U>Stockholder Litigation</U>. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed of any

written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">7.9 <U>Waiver of Standstill Provisions</U>. The restrictions on Parent, Purchaser and their
Affiliates contained in the standstill provisions of the NDA are hereby waived by the Company but
only to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Parent and Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or to comply with their obligations and/or exercise
their legal rights and remedies under this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, such waiver does not
permit the acquisition of the Company (whether by tender offer, merger, business combination or
otherwise) or shares of Company Common Stock by Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates other
than through the Merger and/or any revised proposal made by Parent pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;6.2</U>.

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each director or officer of the Company who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company.

its Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) in the country that is
such Employee&#146;s principal place of employment who are similarly situated to such Employee in title,
rank, tenure and job duties. Nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;7.11</U> shall be deemed to prohibit
Parent from, at any time after the Effective Time, changing the title, rank or job duties of any
Employee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Subject to the ability to do so under the terms of each Parent Benefit Plan and applicable

that is a welfare benefit plan in which such Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Closing Date, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to
such Employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any welfare benefit
plan maintained for the Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)&nbsp;provide each
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Benefit Plans
that are welfare plans in which such Employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing
Date, in each case subject to the terms of the applicable Parent Benefit Plan and applicable Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;If any Employee is terminated from employment by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date and before the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, such Employee shall be entitled to receive the same severance benefits as are provided by the
then-prevailing severance policies of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to employees who are similarly situated to such Employee in
title, rank, tenure and job duties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Nothing contained in this <U>Section&nbsp;7.11</U> shall (1)&nbsp;be treated as an amendment of any

directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Purchaser, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.3 <U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement and the Stockholder Agreements, together with
all annexes, appendices, articles, exhibits, schedules hereto and thereto, constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to
the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the Exclusivity Agreement dated February
19, 2010 by and between Parent and the Company; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that, except as expressly stated
otherwise herein, the NDA shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.4 <U>No Third-Party Beneficiaries</U>. Except for <U>Section&nbsp;7.7</U>, this Agreement is
not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any other Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any
agreement of employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.5 <U>Assignment</U>. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of
law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
that Parent and/or Purchaser may assign this Agreement or assign or delegate any of Parent&#146;s and/or
Purchaser&#146;s rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company, <I>provided </I>that Parent and/or
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.6 <U>Severability</U>. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending
term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable
and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that
will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.7 <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the
same counterpart. Any signature page hereto delivered by facsimile machine or by e-mail (including
in portable document format (pdf), as a joint photographic experts group (jpg)&nbsp;file, or otherwise)
shall be binding to the same extent as an original signature page, with regard to any agreement
subject to the terms hereof or any amendment thereto. Any party who delivers such a signature page
agrees to later deliver an original counterpart to any party who requests it.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.8 <U>Governing Law</U>. The formation, construction, and performance of this Agreement,
including the rights and duties of the parties hereunder, shall be construed, interpreted,

of the CGCL applicable to the Merger shall apply.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.9 <U>Submission to Jurisdiction</U>. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that
any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party(ies) hereto or its
successors or assigns may be brought and determined in the Courts in the States of Arizona,
California and Delaware. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any
such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally,
to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder (i)&nbsp;any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the
failure to validly serve process, (ii)&nbsp;any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iii)&nbsp;to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable
Law, any claim that (x)&nbsp;the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (y)&nbsp;the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or (z)&nbsp;this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.10 <U>Remedies</U>. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any
one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the
parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
