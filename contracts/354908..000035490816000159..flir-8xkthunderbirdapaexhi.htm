(a) Subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.10, as consideration
for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Transferred
Assets to the Purchaser and the Subsidiary Purchasers (collectively, the
"Purchase Price"):

(i) the Purchaser and the Subsidiary Purchasers shall collectively pay to the
Seller, in cash, a total of USD $252,500,000 plus or minus the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment, if any, minus the Holdback Amount, plus the amount
of the Unrestricted Cash, converted to U.S. dollars as of the date of the
Draft Working Capital Statement, based on the noon exchange rate reported by
the Bank of Canada as of such date (the "Cash Purchase Price"); and

(ii) at the Closing, the Purchaser shall assume the Assumed Liabilities, by
delivering to the Seller an Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of
Exhibit D (the "Assumption Agreement").

The Cash Purchase Price shall be payable on the Closing Date as follows: the
Purchaser and the Subsidiary Purchasers shall deliver an aggregate amount
equal to the Cash Purchase Price to the Seller (or one or more of its
designees) in one or more wire transfers of immediately available funds to the
wire transfer address or addresses provided by the Seller to the Purchaser on
or before the Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 1.3(a) above, if the PRC Closing occurs after the
Closing, (i) the Cash Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the PRC Purchase Price; and (ii) the PRC
Purchase Price shall be payable on the PRC Closing Date pursuant to the PG PRC
Equity Transfer Agreement.

1.4 Assumption of Liabilities. At the Closing, and upon all of the terms and
subject to all of the conditions of this Agreement and in reliance on the
representations, warranties and covenants made herein by the Seller, the
Purchaser shall assume all of the Liabilities (a) of the Seller existing at
the Closing and (b) arising out of or relating to (i) the operation of the
Transferred Assets after the Closing and (ii) the Continuing Employees after
the Closing (the "Assumed Liabilities"), other than the Excluded Liabilities
(as defined hereafter).

1.5 Excluded Liabilities. At the Closing, the Seller shall retain and shall be
responsible for paying, performing and discharging when due the Liabilities
set forth on Schedule 1.5 and as set forth in Section 5.8(d) (collectively,
the "Excluded Liabilities").



1.6 Transfer of Subsidiary Interests. Notwithstanding anything in Section 1.1
to the contrary, at the Closing, or as promptly thereafter as all necessary
Legal Requirements have been satisfied, the Seller will transfer the
Subsidiary Interests to the Subsidiary Purchasers as set forth on Schedule 1.6
through the delivery of an executed counterpart to each of the Subsidiary
Purchase Agreements. The amount of the Purchase Price set forth on Schedule
1.6 opposite the Point Grey PRC Subsidiary shall be paid at the PRC Closing by
the applicable Subsidiary Purchaser. The amount of the Purchase Price to be
paid by each applicable Subsidiary Purchaser for the other Seller Subsidiaries
at the Closing shall be mutually agreed to by the parties prior to Closing.

1.7 Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser shall be liable for any sales Taxes, use
Taxes, transfer Taxes or similar Taxes, charges or fees ("Transfer Taxes")
that may become payable in connection with the conveyance and transfer of the
Transferred Assets to the Purchaser or in connection with any of the other
Transactions. The Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) reasonably
cooperate with the Purchaser to determine the extent of any such Transfer
Taxes and to determine and claim any exemptions from such Transfer Taxes under
applicable law and in accordance with Section 1.9.

1.8 Tax Elections. Seller and Purchaser shall:

(a) elect jointly under section 167(1) of the ETA, on prescribed form GST 44
(the "GST Election"), in respect of the sale and transfer of the Transferred
Assets hereunder, and Purchaser shall file such election not later than the
deadline for filing its GST return for its reporting period that includes the
Closing Date; and

(b) elect jointly in the prescribed form and within the prescribed time under
section 22 of the Tax Act (the "Section 22 Election") as to the sale of the
accounts receivable forming part of the Transferred Assets and described in
section 22 of the Tax Act and shall in that election allocate an amount equal
to the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such assets in accordance
with Section 1.9, as the consideration paid by Purchaser therefor.

(c) The Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Purchaser has agreed to
assume the Assumed Liabilities. In the event the Seller has received amounts
in respect of services not rendered or goods not delivered, in each case,
prior to the Closing, the Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge and agree that
to the extent that the Seller's obligations to render or deliver such services
or goods are included in the Assumed Liabilities, a portion of the Transferred
Assets having a fair market value equal to those amounts shall be transferred
to the Purchaser as consideration for the assumption of the Purchaser of such
Assumed Liabilities. The Seller and the Purchaser shall elect jointly in the
prescribed manner and within the prescribed time under subsection 20(24) of
the Tax Act (the "Section 20(24) Election") as to the amount paid by the
Seller to the Purchaser for assuming such Assumed Liabilities.

1.9 Allocation. At least three Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller
shall provide Purchaser with Seller's proposed allocation of the Purchase
Price, including for greater certainty all cash consideration and the amount
of the Assumed Liabilities, among the Transferred Assets (which shall include,
for greater certainty, an allocation in respect of the Transferred Assets that
are subject to Transfer Taxes, including an allocation to any relevant
categories required to determine the taxable, zero-rated or exempt status of
the Transferred Assets). Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing,
Purchaser shall provide any proposed revisions, and for a period of forty-five
(45) days thereafter, Purchaser and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to
agree on, and shall reasonably cooperate in determining, such allocation for
applicable Tax purposes. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall file any Tax
Return with, or make any statement or declaration to, any Governmental Body
that is in any way inconsistent with the allocation if agreed upon in
accordance with



this Section 1.9. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be allocated in
a manner consistent with this Section 1.9.

1.10 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing, the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the "Draft Working Capital Statement")
based on an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Seller and the
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing and in accordance with the
principles and methodologies set forth in Schedule 1.10 containing the
Seller's good faith calculation of the Purchase Price, including the Estimated
Working Capital and the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment.

(b) The Purchase Price is subject to adjustment as follows:

(i) within seventy-five (75) days of the Closing, the Purchaser will review
the Draft Working Capital Statement and the Seller will provide access, upon
every reasonable request, to the Purchaser and its professional advisors to
all working papers of its auditors, its accounting books and records and the
appropriate personnel to verify the accuracy, presentation and other matters
relating to the preparation of the Draft Working Capital Statement;

(ii) if the Purchaser has any objections to the Draft Working Capital
Statement, the Purchaser will so notify the Seller setting out the basis of
each objection and each amount in dispute (the "Disputed Items");

(iii) the Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted the Draft Working Capital
Statement if it does not notify the Seller of any objection within seventy-
five (75) days after the Closing;

(iv) if the Purchaser objects to the Draft Working Capital Statement, the
Purchaser and Seller will work expeditiously and in good faith in an attempt
to resolve the outstanding issues within a further period of ten (10) Business
Days after the date the Purchaser delivers to the Seller a notice of its
objections, and failing resolution the matter will be submitted for
determination to an independent national firm of chartered accountants
mutually agreed to by the Purchaser and the Seller (and, failing such
agreement between the Purchaser and the Seller within a further period of five
Business Days, such independent national firm of chartered accountants will be
Ernst and Young, or if such firm is unable to act, KPMG) (the "Financial
Expert"). The Financial Expert will act as an expert only and not an
arbitrator and its determination will be final and binding upon the parties
and will not be subject to appeal, absent manifest error;

(v) the Purchaser and the Seller will each bear the fees and expenses of their
respective professional advisors in preparing or reviewing, as the case may
be, the Draft Working Capital Statement. If a matter is referred to the
Financial Expert pursuant to this Section 1.10, the costs and expenses of the
Financial Expert will be borne by the party reasonably identified by the
Financial Expert as being the party the majority of whose positions on the
Disputed Items, based on the aggregate value of such positions, were not
sustained by the Financial Expert. The Seller and the Purchaser will each bear
their own costs in presenting their respective cases to the Financial Expert;

(vi) immediately following acceptance or deemed acceptance of the Draft
Working Capital Statement by the Purchaser or the resolution of any dispute in
accordance with Section 1.10(b)(iv), as the case may be, the Purchaser will
deliver to the Seller the final Working Capital statement (the "Closing
Working Capital Statement") containing the Final Working Capital. The Closing
Working Capital



Statement will be final and binding upon the parties and will not be subject
to appeal, absent manifest error; and

(vii) within five Business Days after the delivery of the Closing Working
Capital Statement:

(1) if the amount of the Final Working Capital is equal to the Estimated
Working Capital, there will be no further adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(2) If there is no Estimated Working Capital Adjustment at the Closing
pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then the following shall apply:

a. If the amount of Final Working Capital is greater than the Maximum Target
Working Capital, then the Purchaser will pay to the Seller the amount by which
the Final Working Capital exceeds the Maximum Target Working Capital.

b. If the amount of Final Working Capital is less than the Minimum Target
Working Capital, then the Seller will pay to the Purchaser the amount by which
the Minimum Target Working Capital exceeds the Final Working Capital.

c. If the amount of Final Working Capital is less than or equal to the Maximum
Target Working Capital and greater than or equal to the Minimum Target Working
Capital, there will be no further adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(3) If the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment was a positive number, then
the following shall apply:

a. If the amount of Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Working Capital, then the Purchaser will pay to the Seller the amount of such
excess; or

b. If the amount of Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working
Capital, then the Seller will pay to the Purchaser the amount of such
shortfall; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing:

i. If the Final Working Capital is less than or equal to the Maximum Target
Working Capital and greater than or equal to the Minimum Target Working
Capital, the amount of the downward adjustment of the Purchase Price will be
limited to the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the
Maximum Target Working Capital; and

ii. If the Final Working Capital is less than the Minimum Target Working
Capital, the amount of the downward adjustment of the Purchase Price will be
limited to the sum of (x) the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital
exceeds the Maximum Target Working Capital plus (y) the amount by which the
Minimum Target Working Capital exceeds the Final Working Capital.

(4) If the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment was a negative number, then
the following shall apply:

a. If the amount of Final Working Capital is less than or equal to the
Estimated Working Capital, then the Seller will pay to the Purchaser the
amount of such shortfall; or



b. If the amount of Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Working Capital, then the Purchaser will pay to the Seller the amount of such
excess; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing:

i. If the Final Working Capital is less than or equal to the Maximum Target
Working Capital and greater than or equal to the Minimum Target Working
Capital, the amount of the upward adjustment of the Purchase Price will be
limited to the amount by which the Minimum Target Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Working Capital; and

ii. If the Final Working Capital is greater than the Maximum Target Working
Capital, the amount of the upward adjustment of the Purchase Price will be
limited to the sum of (x) the amount by which the Minimum Target Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital plus (y) the amount by which the
Final Working Capital exceeds the Maximum Target Working Capital.

1.11 Closing.

(a) The closing of the sale of the Transferred Assets (other than the PRC
Equity Interest) to the Purchaser and the Subsidiary Purchasers and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Purchaser (the "Closing") shall
take place at the close of business on a date to be mutually agreed upon by
Purchaser and the Seller, which date shall be no later than three Business
Days after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth
in Section 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions). The date on which the Closing is held is herein referred to as
the "Closing Date." The Closing will be held at the offices of Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, 701 5th Avenue Suite 5100,
Seattle, WA 98104, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. At the Closing, Seller will deliver executed copies of all of the
Transactional Agreements (excluding this Agreement and the PG PRC Equity
Transfer Agreement).

(b) The closing of the transfer of the PRC Equity Interest to the Purchaser
(or one or more of its Affiliates designated by Purchaser) pursuant to the PG
PRC Equity Transfer Agreement (the "PRC Closing") shall take place (i)
concurrently with the Closing if all conditions to the obligations of the
parties set forth in the PG PRC Equity Transfer Agreement are satisfied or
waived on or prior to the Closing Date (other than those conditions which, by
their nature, can only be satisfied at the PRC Closing) (such satisfaction or
waiver of all conditions, the "Satisfaction of Conditions"); or (ii) on the
second Business Day following the Satisfaction of Conditions if the
Satisfaction of Conditions occurs after the Closing Date. The date on which
the PRC Closing actually occurs shall be herein referred to as the "PRC
Closing Date."

1.12 Delivery. To the extent practicable, Seller will deliver all copies of
all Intellectual Property within the Transferred Assets to Purchaser by
electronic means in a manner that Purchaser reasonably specifies.

1.13 Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
the Purchaser shall have the right to deduct and withhold from any payments to
be made hereunder and under the Subsidiary Purchase Agreements such amounts as
may be required by applicable Legal Requirements to be withheld and shall be
provided with any necessary Tax forms, including the appropriate series of
Form W‑8, as applicable, and any similar information. To the extent that any
such amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Person in respect of which
such withholding was made.



1.14 Procedures for Certain Transferred Assets Not Freely Transferable. If any
property or right included in the Transferred Assets, including any
Transferred Contract, is not assignable or transferable to Purchaser either by
virtue of the provisions thereof or under applicable Legal Requirement without
the consent of one or more Persons (each, a "Non-Assignable Right"):

(a) This Agreement and the related instruments of transfer will not constitute
an assignment or transfer of the Non-Assignable Right, and (i) Seller will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent as soon as possible
after the date of this Agreement, and Purchaser will reasonably cooperate with
Seller in Seller's efforts to obtain such consent; and (ii) Seller will have
no obligation pursuant to Section 1.1 otherwise with respect to any such Non-
Assignable Right or any liability with respect thereto and Purchaser will not
assume Seller's rights or obligations under such Non-Assignable Right (and
such Non-Assignable Right will not be included in the Transferred Assets)
unless and until the applicable consent is obtained. Following any such
assignment pursuant to this Section 1.14, such Non-Assignable Right will cease
to be a Non-Assignable Right and will thereafter be deemed a Transferred Asset
for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Until the date a Non-Assignable Right is deemed a Transferred Asset,
Seller and Purchaser will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under
which Purchaser would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations
thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, or under which Seller would
enforce for the benefit of Purchaser, with Purchaser assuming Seller's
obligations, any and all rights of Seller against a third party thereto.
Seller will promptly pay to Purchaser when received all monies received by
Seller under any such Non-Assignable Right or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder.

1.15 Post-Closing Transfers. If, on or after the Closing Date, either Seller
or Purchaser receives any right, property or other asset that, pursuant to the
terms hereof, should belong to the other, the party who receives the asset
agrees to hold in trust and transfer, or cause to be transferred, such asset
to the party entitled thereto within five (5) Business Days of such receipt at
the sole cost and expense of the transferee.

licensed to any Person, agreed to disclose, deliver or license to any Person,
or permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or other Person of
any source code owned by the Seller or any Subsidiary thereof or used in its
business, excluding Open Source Software ("Seller Source Code"). No event has

result in the disclosure or delivery by or on behalf of the Seller or any
Subsidiary thereof of any Seller Source Code.

and rest periods, immigration status, employee safety and health, wages
(including overtime wages), compensation, and hours of work, and in each case,
with respect to Seller Service Providers: (i) has withheld and reported all
amounts required by law or by agreement to be withheld and reported with
respect to wages, salaries and other payments to Seller Service Providers,
(ii) is not liable for any arrears of wages, severance pay or any Tax or any

liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by
or on behalf of any governmental authority, with respect to unemployment
compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for
Seller Service Providers (other than routine payments to be made in the normal
course of business and consistent with past practice). There are no actions,
suits, claims or administrative matters pending, threatened in writing or
reasonably anticipated against Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their Seller Service Providers relating to any Seller Service Provider or
Employee Benefit Plan. Neither Seller or and Subsidiary is party to a
conciliation agreement, consent decree or other agreement or order with any
federal, state, provincial or local agency or governmental authority with
respect to employment practices. The services provided by the U.S. Seller
Service Providers are terminable at the will of Seller and any such
termination would result in no liability to Seller. Neither Seller nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liability with respect to any misclassification of:
(a) any Person as an independent contractor rather than as an employee, (b)
any employee leased from another employer, or (c) any employee currently or
formerly classified as exempt from overtime wages. The Point Grey PRC
Subsidiary has complied with all applicable



PRC laws and regulations with regard to employment and staff or labor
management, including laws and regulations pertaining to social insurance,
medical insurance, housing funds or the like.

(e) No strike, labor dispute, slowdown, concerted refusal to work overtime, or
work stoppage against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is pending, or to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened, or reasonably anticipated. Seller has no
Knowledge of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any
Seller Service Providers. There are no actions, suits, claims, labor disputes
or grievances pending or threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to any
labor matters involving any Seller Service Provider, including charges of
unfair labor practices. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act or similar legislation. Neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries is presently, nor has it been in the past, a party to, or bound
by, any collective bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to
Seller Employees, except for the "Italian Employment Agreements" (it means any
Italian national collective bargaining agreements (contratti collettivi
nazionali di lavoro) and/or union agreements executed at company level (so-
called "contratti integrativi aziendali") applicable to any Subsidiary), and
no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries. The US Subsidiary has not taken any action which would
constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" within the meaning of the U.S.
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN Act") or similar
state or local law, issued any notification of a plant closing or mass layoff
required by the WARN Act or similar state or local law, or incurred any
liability or obligation under the WARN Act or any similar state or local law
that remains unsatisfied. No terminations prior to the Closing by the US
Subsidiary would trigger any notice or other obligations under the WARN Act or
similar state or local law.

(f) Part 2.28(f) of the Disclosure Schedule lists each Employee Benefit Plan.
Each Employee Benefit Plan has been established and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and the provisions of
applicable Legal Requirements. Seller has provided to the Purchaser true,
correct and complete copies of each material Employee Benefit Plan, including
all amendments thereto.

(g) Neither US Subsidiary nor its ERISA Affiliates ever maintained, sponsored,
contributed to or can reasonably be expected to have any Liability with
respect to (i) any "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA
or any other plan subject to the funding requirements of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of Title IV of ERISA; or (ii) any "multiemployer plan" as
defined in Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. Seller has not ever
maintained, sponsored, contributed to or can reasonably be expected to have
any Liability with respect to any "registered pension plan" as defined in
Section 248 of the Tax Act. No Employee Benefit Plan provides retiree medical
or other post-employment benefits to any Person for any reason, except as
required by the healthcare continuation requirements of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or similar Legal
Requirement.

(h) Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable IRS determination
letter or an IRS prototype opinion letter upon which the sponsor is entitled
to rely with respect to its qualified status under the Code and to the
Knowledge of the Seller, nothing has occurred that could be reasonably
expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the
imposition of any Liability, penalty or Tax under applicable Legal
Requirements, including ERISA or the Code.

(i) With respect to each International Employee Plan, Seller has made
available to Purchaser or its counsel a current summary description thereof.

(j) Each International Employee Plan that must be registered or qualified in
the country in which it is maintained has received or timely applied for such
registration or qualification, and such



International Employee Plan has not been amended since the date of its most
recent registration or qualification (or application therefor) in a manner
that would require a new registration or qualification.

(k) All contributions, premiums, expenses and other payments required to be
made by Seller or any Subsidiary to any Employee Benefit Plan by the Closing
Date have been made. All International Employee Plans required to be funded
are fully funded and no liability or obligation of Seller or its Subsidiaries
exists with respect to any International Employee Plan that has not been
disclosed in Part 2.28(k) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(l) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
operated and maintained in compliance with Section 409A of the Code (or any
state law equivalent) and the applicable regulations and guidance thereunder.

(m) The US Subsidiary and its ERISA Affiliates have complied with the
continuation coverage requirements for "group health plans" under Title X of
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 and the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, each as amended, and any similar
provisions of state law, as applicable Seller Service Providers.

investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Seller.

Seller to its shareholders for the approval of the Transactional Agreements
and the Transactions will, at the time supplied and at the time of the

(a) The Seller is, and on the Closing Date (with respect to the PRC Equity

Encumbrances. No Person has preemptive rights with respect to such Subsidiary
Interests.

(b) The Seller has full right, title, power and authority to sell and transfer

Subsidiary Interests pursuant to the terms of the Subsidiary Purchase
Agreements, the Subsidiary Purchasers, as applicable, shall have valid and
marketable title to the Subsidiary Interests, free and clear of any
Encumbrances. The performance by Seller of the Subsidiary Purchase Agreements
and the sale of the Subsidiary Interests to the Subsidiary Purchasers will not
result in a breach



of or default under any agreement or instrument to which Seller is a party or
by which it or any of the Subsidiary Interests may be bound.

(c) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Seller has made available to
Purchaser complete and accurate copies of the organizational documents of each

and to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the

which is by Legal Requirement non-assignable without the consent of the other
party or parties thereto, unless such consent shall have been given.

5.8 Continuing Employees.

Business contemplated hereby and notices of termination to each of the Seller
Employees in a form agreed to by the Seller and the Purchaser, each acting
reasonably; and

(ii) simultaneously with the delivery of the notices by the Seller to the

Exempt Employee and those non-Canadian Seller Employees whose employment will

employment on substantially similar terms and conditions in the aggregate
(excluding eligibility for or receipt of equity compensation) as in effect

compensation owing, up to and as of the Closing Date, in respect of the Seller

severance obligation of the Purchaser arising from its termination of
Continuing Employees employment with Purchaser following the Closing and the
Purchaser will indemnify, defend, save and keep harmless the Seller from and
against all claims, liabilities, damages, payments, obligations, losses, costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and judgments (at law or
in equity) sustained or incurred by the Seller resulting from or arising out
of or by virtue of any claims by the Continuing Employees in respect of
severance payments arising from termination of employment of Continuing
Employees employment with Purchaser following the Closing or unpaid vacation
pay accrued prior to Closing as disclosed to Purchaser on Part 2.28(a) of the

Seller's rights, obligations, and liabilities with respect to each Assigned
Plan. The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate and take all reasonable

cease to accrue benefits under the Employee Benefit Plans on Closing. The
Seller shall be responsible for any contributions, premiums, expenses or other
payments due in respect of each Assigned Plan that are incurred prior to
Closing but not due as of Closing. Effective on Closing, all Continuing
Employees shall continue to participate in, be covered by and accrue benefits
under the Assigned Plans to the extent that the Continuing Employee
participated in the Assigned Plan prior to



Closing. The Purchaser will where applicable, (i) provide credit to such
employees for prior service with the Seller for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting of benefits, (ii) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting period with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Continuing Employees under any benefits plan in which such
employees are eligible to participate after the Closing, to the extent that
such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods would not apply under a
similar Employee Benefit Plan in which such employees participated prior to
the Closing, and (iii) provide each Continuing Employees with credit for
amounts paid under a corresponding Employee Benefit Plan during the same plan
year for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the comparable employee benefit plan in which such Continuing
Employees participate.

5.10 Non-Canadian Seller Employees. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree
that, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.10 for Seller Employees
employed by the US Subsidiary, each contract of employment with a Subsidiary
whose stock is acquired by Purchaser and each non-Canadian Seller Employee
will continue in full force and effect after the Closing Date if mandated
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, and as described in Section 5.8
each such non-Canadian Seller Employee shall be considered a "Continuing
Employee" hereunder. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser or an Affiliate shall
offer all Seller Employees employed by the US Subsidiary "at-will" employment
agreements, having terms consistent with Section 5.8(a)(ii), to be effective
immediately following the Closing and which will supersede existing contracts
of employment with the US Subsidiary and include a requirement for such Seller
Employees to execute Purchaser's standard agreement in respect of
confidentiality, intellectual property and non-competition. Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, comply with
all obligations under applicable Legal Requirements to notify or consult with
non-Canadian Seller Employees (and obtain any requirement consent from any
such non-Canadian Seller Employees) or employment representatives, unions or
other employee representative bodies, and shall timely provide such
information as is required to comply with its notification and/or consultation
obligations.

5.11 No Third Party Beneficiaries. The Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and
agree that all provisions contained in Sections 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10 with respect
to employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties to
this Agreement and shall not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
other Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in
any Seller Employee Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof, or any rights to
continued employment with Seller or Purchaser, nor require Purchaser or any
Purchaser Subsidiary to continue or amend any particular employee benefit plan
after the Closing Date for Continuing Employees, and any such plan may be
amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable Legal
Requirements.

5.12 Notifications. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall promptly
advise the Purchaser in writing of any representation or warranty made by
Seller contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any
failure of Seller to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by Seller
under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be satisfied. No such notification will, in
any way, limit, qualify, modify or affect the validity of the representations
or warranties of the Seller or the Purchaser's remedies or the conditions to
their respective obligations hereunder.

5.13 FIRPTA Certificate. On the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the
Purchaser a properly executed statement, dated as of the Closing Date, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser for purposes of satisfying the

or otherwise consent to any amendment to this Agreement or the taking of any
action that could result in the amendment, modification or a waiver of a

changes the form of the Purchase Price to be received by Seller pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or that otherwise materially and adversely affects
Seller's liabilities or obligations under this Agreement. Except as expressly

Shares as indicated in section 5.14 with respect to Covered Proposals. Each
Key Shareholder will take, and cause to be taken, such further action or

to effectuate the intent of such proxy and revoking any proxy previously
granted by the registered holder of such Key Shareholder's Covered Shares with
respect to such Covered Shares.

negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other
Transactional Agreements or the consummation of the Transactions contemplated
thereby.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, until such time as
the appropriate Clearance Certificate(s) have been provided to the Purchaser,
the Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties (as

shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot
be cured) and if not cured within the timeframe above and at or prior to the
Closing, such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 to be satisfied; or

(e) by the Seller, if Purchaser shall have breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein and such breach shall not
have been cured within 30 days after receipt by Purchaser from the Seller of
written notice of such breach (provided, however, that no such cure period
shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot
be cured) and if not cured within the timeframe above and at or prior to the
Closing, such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 to be satisfied.



8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Purchaser, Seller or their
respective Representatives; provided, however, that (a) the provisions of
Section 7.2 (Publicity), this Section 8.2 and Section 9.10 (Miscellaneous
Provisions) shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination
of this Agreement and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from
liability in connection with any willful breach of such party's
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein prior to
any such termination.

INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL. 

9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive as
follows:

(f) the representations and warranties of the Seller contained in Section 2.1
(Due Organization; Subsidiaries), Section 2.4 (Title to Transferred Assets;
Sufficiency), Section 2.8 (Tax Matters), Section 2.6 (Intellectual Property),
Section 2.14 (Authority; Binding Nature of Agreements) and Section 2.29
(Brokers) of this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the sixth
anniversary thereof; and

(g) all other representations and warranties of the Seller contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the thirty-six (36) month
anniversary of the Closing Date and shall expire thereafter;

(h) all other representations and warranties of the parties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the eighteen (18) month anniversary
of the Closing Date and shall expire thereafter;

provided, however, that such representations or warranties shall survive
beyond such applicable period specified in (a) or (b) above with respect to
(but only with respect to) any breach of or inaccuracy therein that is the
subject of an indemnification claim made within such period in accordance
9.5(a) or 9.5(b), as applicable. The covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive indefinitely unless the covenant or
agreement specifies a term, in which case such covenant or agreement shall
survive for such specified term; provided, however, that such covenant or
agreement shall survive beyond such specified term with respect to (but only
with respect to) any breach thereof or failure to perform the same that is the
subject of an indemnification claim made within such specified term in
accordance with 9.5(a) or 9.5(b), as applicable.

9.2 Indemnification by the Seller. Subject to the other provisions of this
Section 9, from and after the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify, hold
harmless and reimburse the Purchaser, its Affiliates (including Parent),
including the Subsidiaries, and their respective managers, directors,
officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (the "Indemnified
Parties") from and against any and all Losses which any Indemnified Parties
may suffer, sustain or incur arising out of or resulting from, whether or not
in connection with a Third Party Claim:

(d) any breach of or inaccuracy in any warranty or representation of the
Seller contained in Section 2 or Section 5.6 of this Agreement, the Subsidiary
Purchase Agreements or the Seller Certificate;

(e) any breach by the Seller or any Subsidiary of, or failure by the Seller or
any Subsidiary to perform, any of its covenants or other agreements set forth
in any Transactional Agreement;

(f) the amount of any Final Working Capital shortfall due to the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 1.10(b);

(g) any non-compliance by the Seller or any Subsidiary with the provisions of
any bulk sales legislation in any jurisdiction where any of the Transferred
Assets are located;

(h) any of the Excluded Liabilities; and

(i) any Pre-Closing Taxes.

For the avoidance of doubt, any actual or constructive knowledge on the part
of Purchaser of any breach of any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or other obligations by the Sellers, any Subsidiary or any Key
Shareholder shall in no way impact the indemnification obligations set forth
in this Section 9.2. Nothing in this section or elsewhere in this agreement
will operate to limit the liability of any person who commits or participates
in fraud.

9.3 Indemnification by the Key Shareholders. Subject to the other provisions
of this Section 9, from and after the Closing:



(c) solely to the extent the Seller fails to fully satisfy its applicable
indemnification obligations under Section 9.2, each Key Shareholder shall
promptly indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Indemnified Parties from
and against and in respect of his respective pro-rata portion (such pro-rata
portion to be calculated based on that Key Shareholder's respective
shareholdings of Seller as of the date of this Agreement, as set out in
Schedule A), and for greater certainty not on a joint or a joint and several
basis, all Losses which any Indemnified Parties may suffer, sustain or incur
arising out of:

(iii) any breach by the Seller or any Subsidiary of, or failure by the Seller
or any Subsidiary to perform, any of its covenants set forth in any
Transactional Agreement;

(iv) any Pre-Closing Taxes; and

(v) any of the Excluded Liabilities.

(d) each Key Shareholder shall promptly indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse
the Indemnified Parties from and against and in respect of any and all Losses
which any Indemnified Parties may suffer, sustain or incur arising out of:

(v) any breach by such Key Shareholder of or inaccuracy in any warranty or
representation of such Key Shareholder contained in Section 3 of this
Agreement; and

(vi) any breach by such Key Shareholder of, or failure by such Key Shareholder
to perform, any covenants of such Key Shareholder set forth in any
Transactional Agreement.

9.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, an
Indemnified Party may not recover a Loss as a result of a claim pursuant to
Section 9.2 or Section 9.3:

(i) unless the Indemnified Party has given the Indemnifying Party a Claim
Notice or Indemnity Notice, as applicable, with respect to such claim prior to
the date on which the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement ceases to survive pursuant to Section 9.1;

(ii) to the extent such Loss was taken into account as a Working Capital
Liability in calculating the Final Working Capital; or

(iii) to the extent such Loss consists of incidental, consequential, special
or punitive damages, except to the extent such damages are awarded to a third
party in a Third Party Claim.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
indemnity obligations of the Seller under this Section 9 shall be further
limited as set forth in this Section 9.4(b):

(i) the Seller shall (A) only have indemnity obligations for 50% of all Losses
under Section 9.2(a), and (B) have no further indemnity obligations for Losses
under Section 9.2(a) once the aggregate amount of all Losses paid by the
Seller under Section 9.2(a) equals or exceeds the Holdback Amount;



(ii) once the amount of Losses paid by the Seller pursuant to Section 9.2
equals or exceeds the Holdback Amount, the Purchaser's sole recourse for
Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall be the RandW Insurance Policy;

(iii) Seller shall have no liability for indemnity obligations for Losses
under Section 9.2(a) after the release of the Holdback Amount in accordance
with Section 9.6; and

(iv) the aggregate amount of Losses in respect of which Seller shall be liable
shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
indemnity obligations of the Key Shareholders under this Section 9 shall be
further limited as set forth in this Section 9.4(c):

(i) no Key Shareholder will be liable for any Losses related to (A) any Losses
under Section 9.2(a), (B) breaches by any other Key Shareholder of any of such
Key Shareholder's representations or warranties or any agreement, covenant or
other obligation of such other Key Shareholder under this Agreement, or (C)
fraud committed by any other Key Shareholder; and

(ii) the aggregate amount of Losses in respect of which each Key Shareholder
shall be liable hereunder shall not exceed the proceeds to such Key
Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement and such Key Shareholder's pro rata
interest to the proceeds to the Seller from the Transactions as set forth in
Part 2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Shareholder Cap"); provided,
however, that the Shareholder Cap shall not apply to a Key Shareholder for
claims with respect to fraud committed by such Key Shareholder or by the
Seller or any Subsidiary thereof of which such Key Shareholder had actual
knowledge.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement, including the limitations set forth in Section 9.1
and this Section 9.4, shall limit the liability of any Person in respect of
Losses arising out of the fraud of such Person.

(k) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all
references in this Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto to
"material," "material respects" and "Seller Material Adverse Effect" (and
similar materiality qualifications) shall be disregarded solely for purposes
of determining the amount of any Loss that is the subject of indemnification
hereunder.

9.5 Claims for Indemnification. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this Section
9.5:

(a) Third Party Claims. If the Purchaser becomes aware of a third party claim
(a "Third Party Claim") that the Purchaser reasonably believes may result in a
demand for indemnification pursuant to this Section 9, the Purchaser shall
notify the Seller or, if the Seller no longer exists, the representative
appointed pursuant to Section 7.12, in writing of such claim describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder and shall include (if then known) the amount or method of
computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of
this Agreement upon which such claim is based. If the Third Party Claim may
result in a claim against the Seller or the Key Shareholders, the Seller or
the Key Shareholders shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but
not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that the Seller and the Key Shareholders agree and consent, as a
condition of such entitlement of participation, that the Purchaser's legal
counsel in the Third Party Claim shall not be precluded from representing the
Purchaser as against the Seller or Key Shareholders if the Seller or Key
Shareholders disputes the fact or amount of Purchaser's claim of



a Loss related to such matter. The Purchaser shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim (other
than claims related to Excluded Liabilities or Pre-Closing Taxes, which shall
only be settled with the written consent of Seller or Key Shareholders, as
applicable, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided, that, if any claim is settled without the consent of the Seller or
Key Shareholders, as applicable, such settlement shall not be dispositive of
the existence of an indemnifiable claim or the amount of Losses. If the Seller
or Key Shareholders have consented to any such settlement, the Seller or Key
Shareholders, as applicable, shall have no power or authority to object to the
amount of any Third Party Claim by the Purchaser.

(b) Direct Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party discovers any matter
that it has determined has given our could reasonably be expected to give rise
to a claim under Section 9.2 against any Indemnifying Party that does not
involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver an
Indemnity Notice to the Indemnifying Party after the Indemnified Party has
made such determination describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise
to the claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include (if then known)
the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a
reference to the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based.
The Indemnifying Party shall not be relieved of its obligations to indemnify
the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim if the Indemnified Party
fails to timely deliver the Indemnity Notice, except if and only to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Following receipt of an
Indemnity Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the
date it receives such Indemnity Notice (the "Dispute Period") to make such
investigation of the claim as the Indemnifying Party deems necessary or
desirable. For purposes of such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall
make available to the Indemnifying Party all the material information related
to such claim relied upon by, or in the possession or control of, the
Indemnified Party to substantiate such claim, to the extent such information
is not subject to the attorney-client privilege or confidentiality obligations
to a third party. If the Indemnifying Party disagrees with the validity or
amount of all or a portion of such claim made by the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party written notice
thereof (the "Dispute Notice") prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period.
If no Dispute Notice is received by the Indemnified Party within the Dispute
Period or if the Indemnifying Party provides notice that it does not have a
dispute with respect to such claim, such claim will be deemed approved and
consented to by the Indemnifying Party (such claim being referred to herein as
an "Approved Indemnification Claim"). If a Dispute Notice is received by the
Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period and the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party do not agree to the validity and/or amount of such disputed
claim, no payment on the disputed portion of the claim will be made to the
Indemnified Party until such dispute is resolved, whether by adjudication of
such matter, agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party or otherwise.

(c) Final Determination. After any final and non-appealable decision, judgment
or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction, or a settlement or arbitration shall have been consummated, or
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a
mutually binding agreement, with respect to an indemnification claim, or an
indemnification claim becomes an Approved Indemnification Claim (any of the
foregoing events, a "Final Determination"), then if Seller or a Key
Shareholder is the Indemnifying Party, the Holdback Amount shall be reduced by
the amount so determined; provided that if a Key Shareholder is the
Indemnifying Party, the Holdback Amount shall not be reduced in excess of such
Key Shareholder's Shareholder Cap.

(d) RandW Insurance Policy Claims. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.5
to the contrary, if the Purchaser makes an indemnification claim pursuant to
this Section 9.5 claiming Losses under Section 9.2(a), a final and non-
appealable determination by Ambridge Partners with respect to such claim,
shall be deemed to be a Final Determination with respect thereto.



9.6 Distribution of Holdback Amount. Upon the 12 month anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Holdback Termination Date"), the unused portion of the
Holdback Amount (the "Holdback Release Amount") shall promptly (but in any
event, within five (5) Business Days) be delivered to the Seller (or if Seller
has been dissolved to the representative appointed pursuant to Section 7.8);
provided, however, that the Holdback Release Amount shall not include the
amount of any unsatisfied claims for Losses made on or prior to the Holdback
Termination Date and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9. As
soon as any such claim has been resolved, the Purchaser shall immediately
deliver the applicable portion of the Holdback Release Amount not required to
satisfy the remaining claims to the Seller. Without limiting the generality of
Section 9.9, the Holdback Release Amount when ultimately determined shall be
added to the Purchase Price.

9.7 Insurance Offset. If any Losses sustained by an Indemnified Party are
covered by the RandW Insurance Policy or otherwise under an insurance policy or
an indemnification, contribution or reimbursement obligation of another Person
(other than an Affiliate of such Indemnified Party), the Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect such insurance proceeds
or indemnity, contribution or reimbursement payments. If the Indemnified Party
receives such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or reimbursement
payments prior to being indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed under
Section 9.2 with respect to such Losses, the payment by an Indemnifying Party
under this Section 9 with respect to such Losses shall be reduced by the net
amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar
payments to the extent related to such Losses, less any costs of collection
(including reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in
connection with such recovery) and, in the case of insurance proceeds, any
increase in insurance premiums resulting from the payment of such insurance
proceeds. If the Indemnified Party receives such insurance proceeds or
indemnity, contribution or reimbursement payments after being indemnified and
held harmless by an Indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses, the
Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the net amount of such
insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payment to the extent
related to such Losses, less any costs of collection (including reasonable
attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in connection with such recovery)
and, in the case of insurance proceeds, any increase in insurance premiums
resulting from the payment of such insurance proceeds. If any Indemnified
Party receives payment under this Section 9 on account of a claim that an
Indemnifying Party believes in good faith is covered by an insurance policy or
an indemnification, contribution or similar obligation of another Person
(other than an Affiliate of such Indemnified Party), that Indemnified Party
(i) may, in its sole and absolute discretion, on written request of the
Indemnifying Party assign, to the extent assignable, its rights under such
insurance policy or indemnification, contribution or reimbursement obligation
with respect to such claim to the Indemnifying Party and, if it elects to
assign such rights, (ii) shall be relieved of any further obligation to pursue
collection of such insurance or indemnification, contribution or similar
obligation (except that, if requested to do so by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party at the Indemnifying Party's sole expense, to collect
any such insurance or indemnification, contribution or reimbursement
obligation).

9.8 Exclusivity. After the Closing, the indemnities set forth in this Section
9 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except (a)
subject to the provisions set forth in Section 9.4(c) and (d)), in the case of
fraud by Seller, any Subsidiary or any of the Key Shareholders under this
Agreement or any Transactional Agreement, (b) as provided in Section 10.9
(Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance) and Section 7.6 (Clearance
Certificates), (c) for enforcement of Section 7.3 (Non-Solicitation; Non-
Compete), Section 7.4 (Name Change) and Section 7.7 (Post-Closing Operations
of the Seller) and (d) for the right to specific performance or other similar
non-monetary equitable remedies with respect to the covenants and obligations
contained in, and any other remedies available to the parties under, the other
Transactional Agreements and any other



written and signed agreements entered into in connection with the
Transactions. The parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this
Agreement after the Closing.

9.9 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. To the extent permitted by Legal
Requirements, any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 9 shall be
considered adjustments to the Purchase Price for all income Tax purposes.

9.10 Indemnification by Purchaser. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
hold harmless and indemnify Seller and each of its Representatives (the
"Seller Indemnitees") from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
each of the Seller Indemnitees for, any Losses that the Seller Indemnitees may
suffer, sustain or incur arising out of or resulting from (regardless of
whether or not such Losses relate to any third-party claim):

(a) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement;

(b) any breach of any covenant or obligation of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement; and

(c) any failure of Purchaser to discharge the Assumed Liabilities when due and
payable.

9.11 Claims for Indemnification by Seller. All claims for indemnification by
any Seller Indemnitee shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this
Section 9.11:

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Seller Indemnitee becomes aware of a third
party claim (a "Seller Third Party Claim") that the Seller Indemnitee
reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification pursuant to
this Section 9, Seller Indemnitee shall notify the Purchaser in writing
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall include (if then known) the amount or
method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based. If the Seller
Third Party Claim may result in a claim against the Purchaser, Purchaser shall
be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or
conduct, the defense of such Seller Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
the Purchaser agree and consent, as a condition of such entitlement of
participation, that the Seller Indemnitee's legal counsel in the Seller Third
Party Claim shall not be precluded from representing the Seller Indemnitee as
against the Purchaser if the Purchaser disputes the fact or amount of Seller
Indemnitee's claim of a Loss related to such matter. Seller shall have the
right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of any such claim. Seller
shall have the right to settle any such claim (other than claims related to
Assumed Liabilities, which shall only be settled with the written consent of
the Purchaser, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
provided, that, if any claim is settled without the consent of the Purchaser,
such settlement shall not be dispositive of the existence of an indemnifiable
claim or the amount of Losses. If the Purchaser has consented to any such
settlement, the Purchaser shall have no power or authority to object to the
amount of any Seller Third Party Claim by the Seller.

(b) Direct Claims. In the event any Seller Indemnitee discovers any matter
that it has determined has given our could reasonably be expected to give rise
to a claim under Section 9.10 against Purchaser that does not involve a Seller
Third Party Claim, the Seller Indemnitee shall promptly deliver an Indemnity
Notice to the Purchaser after the Seller Indemnitee has made such
determination describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the
claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include (if then known) the
amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference
to the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based. Seller
shall not be relieved of its obligations to indemnify



the Seller Indemnitees with respect to such claim if the Seller fails to
timely deliver the Indemnity Notice, except if and only to the extent the
Seller is actually prejudiced thereby. Following receipt of an Indemnity
Notice, the Seller shall have thirty (30) days from the date it receives such
Indemnity Notice (the "Seller Dispute Period") to make such investigation of
the claim as the Purchaser deems necessary or desirable. For purposes of such
investigation, the Seller Indemnitees shall make available to the Purchaser
all the material information related to such claim relied upon by, or in the
possession or control of, the Purchaser to substantiate such claim, to the
extent such information is not subject to the attorney-client privilege or
confidentiality obligations to a third party. If the Purchaser disagrees with
the validity or amount of all or a portion of such claim made by the Seller
Indemnitee, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller Indemnitee written
notice thereof (the "Seller Dispute Notice") prior to the expiration of the
Seller Dispute Period. If no Seller Dispute Notice is received by the Seller
Indemnitee within the Seller Dispute Period or if the Purchaser provides
notice that it does not have a dispute with respect to such claim, such claim
will be deemed approved and consented to by the Purchaser. If a Seller Dispute
Notice is received by the Seller Indemnitees within the Seller Dispute Period
and the Seller Indemnitee and the Purchaser do not agree to the validity
and/or amount of such disputed claim, no payment on the disputed portion of
the claim will be made to the Seller Indemnitee until such dispute is
resolved, whether by adjudication of such matter, agreement between the Seller
Indemnitee and the Purchaser or otherwise.

9.12 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, a
Seller Indemnitee may not recover a Loss as a result of a claim pursuant to
Section 9.10:

(i) unless the Seller Indemnitee has given the Purchaser notice with respect
to such claim prior to the date on which the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement ceases to survive pursuant to Section 9.1;

(ii) to the extent such Loss consists of incidental, consequential, special or
punitive damages, except to the extent such damages are awarded to a third
party in a third party claim.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
indemnity obligations of the Purchaser under this Section 9 shall not, in the
aggregate, exceed the Purchase Price.
