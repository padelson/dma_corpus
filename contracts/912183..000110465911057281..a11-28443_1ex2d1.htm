$4.25 for each Share, net to the seller in cash (the " _Closing Amount_ "),
without interest, plus (b) one contingent payment right for each Share (a "
_CPR_ "), which shall represent the right to receive the Payment Amounts (as
such term is used in the Contingent Payment Rights Agreement in the form
attached hereto as Annex IV (the " _CPR Agreement_ ") to be entered into
between Parent and Computershare Inc., a Delaware corporation and its fully
owned subsidiary Computershare Trust Company, N.A., a national banking

Offer, referred to herein as the " _Offer Price_ ";

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Sub and the Company has approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger
following the Offer, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(" _DGCL_ ") and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has determined that the consideration to be paid for each Share

this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement, certain

tender and voting agreements, dated as of the date hereof, in substantially
the form set forth in _Annex II_ , pursuant to which, among other things, the
Principal Stockholders have agreed to tender Shares to Sub in the Offer (the "
_Tender and Voting Agreement_ "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Sub desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the
Merger.

      
 

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

 



 

SECTION 1 - THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 



 

1.1. _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1, Parent shall cause Sub to, and Sub shall commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer as promptly as practicable and in any event no
later than the tenth (10th) business day following the date hereof. The
obligations of Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be
extended in accordance with this Section 1.1(a) ) shall be subject only to the
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "
and each an " _Offer Condition_ "). Subject to the prior satisfaction or, to
the extent permitted, waiver by Parent and Sub of the Offer Conditions, Parent
shall cause Sub to, and Sub shall, consummate the Offer in accordance with its
terms and accept for payment and pay the Offer Price for all Shares tendered
and not withdrawn promptly following the acceptance in compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer.
The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement and the Offer
Conditions. Parent and Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any Offer
Conditions, to increase the Offer Price and to make any other changes in the
terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sub shall not, and Parent
shall cause Sub not to, decrease the Closing Amount or CPR Payment Amount,
change the form of payment of the Closing Amount or CPR Payment Amount,
decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer, waive or change the Minimum
Condition, impose additional conditions to the Offer, amend any of the Offer
Conditions so as to broaden the scope of any such condition, extend the offer
beyond a date that is twenty-one (21) business days after commencement of the
Offer or the last extension in accordance with this Section 1.1, if any, of
the Offer, whichever is later (the " _Expiration Date_ ") except as set forth
below, or otherwise amend any other term or condition of the Offer in a manner
materially adverse to the holders of Shares, in each case without the prior
written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to
the parties respective termination rights set forth in Section 8.1, Sub may,
without the consent of the Company (i) extend the Offer beyond the initial
expiration date if, at any scheduled (or extended) expiration of the Offer,
any of the conditions to Subs obligation to accept Shares for payment, shall
not be satisfied or waived, (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by
any rule, regulation or interpretation of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") or its staff applicable to the Offer. In
addition to the foregoing, Sub also may provide a "subsequent offering period"
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act if, as of the Expiration
Date, all of the conditions to Subs obligations to accept for payment and pay
for all Shares are satisfied or waived, but there shall not have been validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that number of Shares
necessary to permit the Merger to be effected without a meeting of the
Companys stockholders in accordance with the DGCL.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to the parties respective termination rights set forth in Section
8.1, if, at the time at which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer
Condition has not been satisfied or has not been validly waived, then, if so
requested by the Company by written notice on or prior to the date the Offer
is then scheduled to expire, Sub shall extend the Offer for up to one period
of not more than five (5) business days per extension period, until all of the
Offer Conditions have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, validly
waived; provided, however, that the Company shall not have the right to
request an extension pursuant to this Section 1.1(b) if, at the time of any
proposed extension, an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly made and the
Company Board of Directors failed to reaffirm its recommendation of the Offer
within two (2) business days of Parents request.

 



 

(c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with
the SEC, pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_
"), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement
(collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ "). Subject to Section 5.2, the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation and the approval of
the Company Board of Directors referred to in Section 3.20(a). Subject to the
Companys compliance with Section 1.2(c), Parent and Sub agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Law. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by Law. Parent and
Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as
so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
TO and any amendment thereto before it is filed with the SEC, and Parent and
Sub shall give due consideration to all reasonable and appropriate additions,
deletions or changes thereto suggested by the Company and its legal counsel.
In addition, Parent and Sub agree to provide the Company with any comments,
whether written or oral, that Parent, Sub or their counsel may receive from
time to time prior to the expiration or termination of the Offer, from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, promptly after receipt of
such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto, and the Company
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review such comments and have the
right to consult with Parent, Sub and their counsel prior to responding to any
such comments, either in written or oral form, and Parent and Sub shall give
due consideration to the reasonable and appropriate views and comments of the
Company and its legal counsel related thereto.

 



 

(d) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Sub promptly following the
expiration of the Offer or any subsequent extension thereof, as applicable,
all funds necessary to pay the aggregate Closing Amounts with respect to
Shares that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
and that Sub is obligated to accept for payment pursuant to the Offer and
permitted to accept for payment under applicable Law.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) Parent shall, at or prior to the Acceptance Time (as defined in Section
5.2(b)), duly authorize, execute and deliver the CPR Agreement.

 



 

1.2. _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 5.2 and to any consents or approvals of the Companys
stockholders required under applicable Law, the Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(b) On the date the Offer is commenced, the Company shall, in a manner that
complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ")
which shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.2, contain the
recommendation of the Company Board of Directors referred to in Section
3.20(a) and all information required by Delaware Law. The Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall provide to Parent a copy
of the Company financial advisors fairness opinion and a summary of the
analysis underlying such fairness opinion to be included in the Schedule
14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Sub, on the other hand,
agree to promptly correct and supplement any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by Law. The
Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Sub
shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and
any amendment thereto before filing with the SEC and the Company and its
counsel shall give due consideration to all reasonable and appropriate
additions, deletions or changes thereto suggested by Parent and its counsel.
In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent and Sub any comments,
whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time
to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after receipt of such comments, and to consult with Parent, Sub and their
counsel and give due consideration to all reasonable and appropriate
additions, deletions or changes thereto suggest by Parent and its counsel
prior to responding to any such comments, either in written or oral form.

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent or
Sub mailing labels, security position listings and all available listings and
computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the
Shares as of a recent date, and of those persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date, and shall promptly furnish Parent or Sub with such
information and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of holders of
the Shares, updated periodically, and their addresses, mailing labels and
lists of security positions) as Parent or Sub or its agent(s) may reasonably
request. Subject to applicable Law, such information shall be held
confidential by Parent and Sub under the terms of the Mutual Confidentiality
and Non-Use Agreement, dated July 26, 2011, entered into between Parent and
the Company (as amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the Confidentiality Agreement does
not restrict steps to prepare, file or

 



      
 

 



 

disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

1.3. _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective

Merger and will continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware;

generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Sub
shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to be
in the form of _Annex III_ and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company or Sub, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to be identical to the bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (except that such bylaws shall be amended to
reflect that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Adolor
Corporation), and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided by the DGCL, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 



 

1.4. _Effective Time_. Parent, Sub and the Company shall cause a certificate
of merger complying with Section 251 of the DGCL or a certificate of ownership

_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed on the Closing Date (or on
such other date as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective on the time and date on which the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such
later time and date as is specified in the Certificate of Merger ( _provided_
, _however_ , that such later time and date shall not be more than five (5)
business days after the filing without the written consent of the Company),
such time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

 



 

1.5. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at 9:00 a.m. (Boston time) on a date to be specified by the parties, such date
to be no later than the second (2nd) business day after satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions set forth in SECTION 7 capable of satisfaction prior
to the Closing (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of

 



      
 

 



 

Ropes and Gray LLP, Prudential Tower, 800 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts
02199, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties

1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers of **** Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation
and bylaws. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each member
of the Company Board of Directors, other than Parents or Subs designees
pursuant to Section 6.8, to execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or
her resignation as a director of the Company upon the Effective Time.

 



 

1.7. _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be
advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either the Company
or Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement,
then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
each such corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may
be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title
or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

1.8. _Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
shall:

 



 

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders to consider the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Special
Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time;

 



 

(ii) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time, prepare
and file with the SEC under the Exchange Act a preliminary proxy or
information statement relating to the Merger and this Agreement and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and furnish the information required to be
included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement and, after Parent shall have had a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, respond
promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy
or information statement and cause a definitive proxy or information statement
(in either case, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be mailed to its stockholders
as promptly as practicable;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) subject to Section 5.2, include in the Proxy Statement the
recommendation of the Company Board of Directors that the stockholders of the
Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement; and

 



 

(iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from holders of Shares
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and take all other action
reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the approval of stockholders
required by the DGCL and any other applicable Law and the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws to effect the Merger.

 



 

(b) Parent agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then
beneficially owned by Sub in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger.

 



 

1.9. _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding Section 1.8, in
the event that Sub has acquired at least ninety percent (90%) of the
outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company entitled to
vote on the Merger, pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the parties hereto
agree, at the request of Parent and subject to SECTION 7, to take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of stockholders
of the Company, in accordance with and subject to the DGCL.

 



 

1.10. _Top-Up Option_.

 



 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up
Option_ "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 1.10, to purchase at a price per share equal to the greater of (i) the
last reported sale price of a Share on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the last
trading day prior to the date on which the Top-Up Option is exercised or (ii)
the Closing Amount, newly issued Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") so that,
when added to the number of Shares owned by Sub prior to the exercise of the
Top-Up Option, Sub will own at least ninety percent (90%) of the Shares
outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (not including
in the Shares owned by Sub any Shares tendered pursuant to unfulfilled
guaranteed delivery procedures); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Top-Up
Option shall not be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the Shares
authorized and unissued at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option and (ii)
the Top-Up Option may not be exercised unless, following the Acceptance Time
or after a subsequent offering period, seventy percent (70%) or more of the
Shares shall be owned by Sub. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once at
any time following the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of
(A) the Effective Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms. Sub may assign the Top-Up Option and its rights and
obligations pursuant to this Section 1.10, in its sole discretion, to Parent.

 



 

(b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up Shares complies with all applicable Laws, including compliance with
an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If Sub
wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Sub shall give the Company written
notice, specifying (i) the number of Shares owned by Sub, (ii) a place and a
time for the closing of such purchase and (iii) the manner in which Sub

 



      
 

 



 

intends to pay the applicable purchase price. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Sub
specifying, based on the information provided by Sub in its notice, the number
of Top-Up Shares. Prior to the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares,
upon Subs request, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its transfer agent to certify in writing to Sub the number of Shares issued
and outstanding (A) as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option and (B) after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

 



 

(c) The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares may be paid, at
Subs option, (i) in cash, (ii) by executing and delivering to the Company a
promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the
remaining aggregate purchase price, or (iii) a combination thereof, provided
that Sub shall use cash for at least the aggregate par value of the Top-Up
Shares. The Company Board has approved such consideration for the Top-Up
Shares. Any such promissory note shall include the following terms: (1) the
maturity date shall be one (1) year after issuance, (2) the unpaid principal
amount of the promissory note shall accrue simple interest at a per annum rate
of 3.00% and (3) the promissory note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any
time, without penalty or prior notice.

 



 

(d) Parent and Sub acknowledge that the Shares that Sub may acquire upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under the Securities Act
and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption for transactions not
involving a public offering. Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up
Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being
and shall be acquired by Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the
meaning of the Securities Act).

 



 

(e) The obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Shares upon the exercise
of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (i) no provision of any
applicable Law and no judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect
of such exercise, (ii) due to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of
Shares owned by Parent, Sub and their Affiliates will constitute more than
ninety percent (90%) of the number of Shares that will be outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, and
(iii) Sub has accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered in the Offer
and not withdrawn.

 



 

SECTION 2 - CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 



 

2.1. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any Shares or any
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub (" _Sub Common
Stock_ "):

 



 

(a) _Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Sub Common Stock
shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All Shares that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares owned by Parent or
Sub shall

 



      
 

 



 

automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be payable in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Shares_. Subject to Section 2.4, each issued and
outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive the (i) the Closing Amount, payable to the holder thereof in
cash, without interest, plus (ii) one CPR, or any such higher consideration as
may be paid in the Offer (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the
Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _Book-
Entry Share_ ") representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2.

 



 

2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Parent shall designate StockTrans, Inc. or another bank or
trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for
the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
and to receive the aggregate Closing Amounts to which holders of Shares shall
become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent on a timely basis, promptly (in any
event no later than the immediately following business day) after the
Effective Time, and as and when needed after the Effective Time, cash
necessary to pay the aggregate Closing Amounts for the Shares converted in the
Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If for any reason the
Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the aggregate Closing Amounts to which
holders of Shares shall be entitled under Section 2.1(c), Parent shall
promptly deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit
additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments of
aggregate Closing Amounts, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in
any event be liable for payment thereof. The Paying Agent may invest the cash
in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such
investments, if any, shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States, in commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or
A-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in money market funds that invest only in such
United States government and commercial paper obligations. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. No
investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required under this Article
II, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly
provide any additional cash funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
Companys shareholders at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses,
which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares,
whose shares were

 



      
 

 



 

converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss for such Certificates) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
mutually agree prior to the Effective Time); and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and properly completed and such other documents as
may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without
interest thereon, and shall not evidence any interest in, or any right to
exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equity holder of, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this SECTION 2.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six
(6) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying
Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are not surrendered prior to
the time such Certificates or Book-Entry shares would otherwise escheat to, or
become Property of, any Governmental Entity, unclaimed Merger Consideration
payable with respect to such Shares shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.

 



 

2.3. _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right
to appraisal. From and after the Effective Time, a stockholder who has
properly exercised such appraisal rights shall not have any rights of a
stockholder of the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Shares, except those provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such Shares held by him, her or it in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal, in which case such
Shares shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, pursuant to Section 2.2. The parties hereby
agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to the
Dissenting Shares, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
fair value of the Dissenting Shares shall be determined in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL without regard to the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Shares
or any promissory note delivered by Sub or Parent to the Company in payment
for the Top-Up Shares.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written
demands for appraisal (including copies of such demands), attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments received by the Company
relating to rights of appraisal; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
the conduct of all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.

 



 

2.4. _Company Incentive Plans_.

 



 

(a) At the Acceptance Time, each stock option (each a " _Company Option_ "
and, collectively, the " _Company Options_ ") that was granted under the
Companys Amended and Restated 1994 Equity Compensation Plan or its 2011
Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plan (formerly known as the 2003 Amended
and Restated Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plan) (the " _Company Stock
Plans_ ") and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
shall vest in full to the extent not already vested. The Company shall have
provided to each holder of a Company Option, prior to the Effective Time,
written notice and an opportunity to exercise such Company Option prior to the
Effective Time. Between the Acceptance Time and

 



      
 

 



 

the Effective Time, Company Options that have an exercise price of less than
$4.25 per share may be exercised, with such exercise effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by assignment to the Surviving Corporation of a
sufficient portion of the Closing Amount payable in the Merger with respect to
the shares subject to such Company Options, provided that the holder of such
Company Options irrevocably undertakes to exchange such shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(b) hereof and instructs the Paying Agent to deduct the applicable
portion of the Closing Amount that would otherwise be payable with respect to
such shares. At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company Option shall
be canceled and shall immediately cease to be outstanding, without any payment
in respect of such Company Option or cancellation thereof except as provided
in the following sentence. In full satisfaction of the cancellation of any
Company Option described in the immediately preceding sentence that had a per-
Share exercise price less than the last reported sale price of a Share on The
Nasdaq Stock Market on the last trading day prior to the Acceptance Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, following the
Effective Time, pay to the holder of such Company Option, (x) an amount in
cash in respect thereof equal to the product of (I) the excess, if any, of the
last reported sale price of a Share on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the last
trading day prior to the Acceptance Time over the per-Share exercise price of
such Company Option and (II) the number of Shares subject thereto (such
payments to be net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.6). As
of the Effective Time, no Person shall retain any rights with respect to any
previously outstanding Company Options except for the rights of a holder to
receive any payment expressly contemplated by this Section 2.4(a).

 



 

(b) At the Acceptance Time, each share of restricted stock that was granted by
the Company under a Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Restricted Share"_
and, collectively, the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") that is unvested and
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall vest and, after
satisfaction of all applicable Tax and other withholding requirements pursuant
to Section 2.6, be converted into the right to receive, as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) At the Acceptance Time, each performance-based deferred stock unit (each,
a " _Performance-Based DSU_ " and, collectively, the " _Performance-Based
DSUs_ ") and each time-vested deferred stock unit (each, a " _Time-Vested DSU_
" and, collectively, the " _Time-Vested DSUs_ ") (the Performance-Based DSUs
and the Time-Vested DSUs being collectively referred to herein as the "DSUs")
that was granted by the Company under a Company Stock Plan that is unvested
and outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall vest and shall
be satisfied by delivery of an equivalent number of Shares, less such number
of Shares as shall be withheld pursuant to Section 2.6 to satisfy applicable
Tax and other withholding requirements, such remaining Shares to be converted
into the right to receive, as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) Any amounts to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be in lieu of
any amounts that would otherwise be payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in
respect of Shares subject to Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and
DSUs, as applicable.

 



 

(e) As of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans shall terminate and all
rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing
for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital
stock of the Company or any Company

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiary shall be cancelled. The Company shall take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section
2.4, including, but not limited to, sending out the requisite notices,
obtaining any necessary resolutions of the Board or a committee thereof, and
obtaining all consents necessary to cash out and cancel all Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock, and DSUs, so as to ensure that, after the Effective
Time, no person shall have any rights under the Company Stock Plans except for
the right to receive the payments, if any, contemplated by Section 2.4(a),
2.4(b) or 2.4(c).

 



 

2.5. _Section 16_. The Company Board of Directors shall, to the extent
necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Acceptance Time, to
approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act the disposition and
cancellation of Shares (and related derivative securities) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

2.6. _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Sub and Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from any cash consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Shares, Company
Options, Company Restricted Stock or DSUs, in each case directly or through an
authorized agent with respect to any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
" _Code_ ") or any provision of any other applicable federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law from any such consideration, as reasonably determined by
Parent. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, **** (i) the
Company shall (a) prior to the Acceptance Time, make arrangements consistent
with the requirements of applicable law with each holder of Company Restricted
Stock for the prompt satisfaction (through the withholding or tendering of
Shares or otherwise) of all withholding tax obligations required to be
satisfied in respect of the vesting of such Company Restricted Stock pursuant
to Section 2.4(b) above, such arrangements to be reasonably satisfactory to
Parent; and (b) satisfy or cause to be satisfied, timely and in full including
through the withholding of Shares in the case of the DSUs, all tax
withholdings required or in respect of any other vesting or payment event in
respect of Company Options or DSUs for which the required tax remittance is
due prior to the Effective Time, (ii) nothing in the preceding sentence shall
limit the ability and right of the Surviving Corporation to satisfy its tax
withholding obligations by other means, and (iii) to the extent the Company or
Surviving Corporation remits payroll taxes (other than FUTA or the employer
portion of FICA) or other required withholdings with respect to the vesting of
Company Restricted Shares or in respect of any other vesting or payment event
in respect of Company Options or DSUs and there is not a corresponding
withholding from amounts payable to the employee or former employee (the
amount not withheld, the "shortfall amount"), each of Parent, Sub and
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, for the benefit of the Surviving
Corporation, any such shortfall amount from any cash consideration described
in the first sentence of this Section 2.6.

 



 

2.7. _Transfer Taxes_. If any payment pursuant to the Offer or the Merger is
to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares

 



   

     
 

 



 

surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered
or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either
has been paid or is not applicable.

Except as (i) set forth on the Disclosure Letter delivered by the Company to
Parent on the date hereof (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the section
numbers of which are numbered to correspond to the section numbers of this
Agreement to which they refer; provided, however, that (x) an item disclosed
for any Section of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed for
each other Section of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such
disclosure to such other Section is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure and (y) the mere inclusion of an item in such Company Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item constitutes a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and (ii) factual information disclosed in any periodic report filed by
the Company with the SEC after January 1, 2011 and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosures under the heading "Risk

nature), the Company hereby makes the following representations and warranties
to Parent and Sub:

 



 

3.1. _Organization and Qualification_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or other
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its
business as now being and as heretofore conducted. Each of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary is qualified or otherwise authorized to transact
business as a foreign corporation or other organization in all jurisdictions
in which such qualification or authorization is required by Law, except for
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or authorized and in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any change,
event, circumstance, effect or development that, individually or in the
aggregate with all other changes, events, circumstances, effects or
developments that exist on the date of determination, has had a material
adverse effect on (i) the assets, properties, business, capitalization,
results of operations, or financial condition of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ _,_
_however_ , that none of the following shall constitute or be deemed to
contribute to a Company Material Adverse Effect or shall be taken into account
in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would
occur: any adverse effect arising out of, resulting from or attributable to
(i) (A) the United States or global economy generally or capital or financial
markets generally, including changes in interest or exchange rates, (B)
political conditions generally of the United States or any other country or
jurisdiction in which the Company operates, (C) changes that are the result of
factors generally affecting any of the industries in which the Company
operates or in which products or services of the Business

 



      
 

 



 

are used or distributed, (D) any hostilities, act of war, sabotage, terrorism
or military actions, or any escalation or worsening of any such hostilities,
act of war, sabotage, terrorism or military actions, or (E) any changes or
prospective changes in applicable Law or United States generally accepted
accounting principles or interpretation thereof, (ii) the announcement of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any failure by the Company
to achieve any earnings or other financial projections or forecasts (including
securities analysts published projections), (iv) any change in the trading
price or trading volume of the Shares, (v) actions taken with Parents written
consent or at Parents written request, and (vi) the termination for cause or
voluntary resignations, retirements or death or disability of any employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except in the case of the foregoing
clause (i) to the extent such effect or change is materially
disproportionately adverse with respect to the Company as compared to other
Persons engaged in the industries of the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company has previously provided to Parent true and complete copies of
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other organizational documents
of the Company and each Company Subsidiary as presently in effect, and none of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in default in the performance,
observation or fulfillment of such documents, except, in the case of Company
Subsidiaries, such defaults that, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

3.2. _Authority to Execute and Perform Agreement_. The Company has the
corporate power and authority to enter into, execute and deliver this
Agreement and, subject, in the case of consummation of the Merger, to the
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of the Shares, to perform fully its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized
by the Company Board of Directors. No other action on the part of the Company
is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of the Shares). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Sub) constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited by the effect of
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and the effect of
general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity.

 



 

3.3. _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company as of the date of this

necessary so that those individuals will resign and be replaced by individuals
specified by Parent effective as of the Effective Time. All issued and
outstanding shares or other equity interests of each Company Subsidiary are
owned directly by the Company free and clear of any charges, liens,

power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation (to the extent such
concepts are applicable) in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so organized,
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that are not
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are not as
of the date hereof, and at the Effective Time there will not be, any

Company Joint Venture, the interest held by the Company and the jurisdiction

Ventures held by the Company are held directly by the Company, free and clear
of any charges, liens, encumbrances, security interests or adverse claims. The

since January 1, 2008 was or will be accompanied by the certifications
required to be filed or submitted by the Companys principal executive officer
and principal financial officer pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 promulgated under the Exchange Act and, at the time of filing
or submission of each such certification, such certification complied or will
comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 promulgated under the Exchange
Act. If the Company will be a "significant subsidiary" (as such term is
defined in Article 1 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Exchange Act) of
Parent upon consummation of the Merger, the parties agree that failure of the
Companys chief executive officer or chief financial officer to provide an
unqualified certification in any certification required to be filed with any
document filed with the SEC shall constitute an event that has a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in
accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (ii) access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization; and (iii) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences. The Company maintains
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that all material information concerning the Company is made known on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys SEC
Reports. Since the date of the filing of the Companys most recent annual
report on Form 10-K, prior to the date of this Agreement, the Companys
outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors
have not been advised of (A) any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Any material
change in internal control over financial reporting and any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any Company SEC Report or
in any form, report or document filed by the Company with the SEC has been so
disclosed and each

 



      
 

 



 

significant deficiency and material weakness previously so disclosed have been
remediated. The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable listing and other rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market.

 



 

(d) The Company is not a party to, or does not have any commitment to become a
party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
contract (including any contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company in the Company SEC Reports.

 



 

3.7. _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the Company
Balance Sheet or in the consolidated unaudited balance sheet of the Company in

Quarterly Balance Sheet_ ") and except for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business since the date of the Company Balance Sheet, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities required to
be reflected or reserved against on or disclosed in the Company Balance Sheet
that were not adequately reflected or reserved against on or disclosed in the
Company Balance Sheet. The Company has no material liabilities of any nature,
whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, other than liabilities (a)
adequately reflected or reserved against on or disclosed in the Company
Balance Sheet or the Company Quarterly Balance Sheet, (b) included in Section
3.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter, or (c) that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

3.8. _Absence of Adverse Changes_. Since the date of the Company Balance

that is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. From the
date of the Company Balance Sheet until the date of this Agreement, except as
contemplated hereby, (a) the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, has been conducted in the ordinary course of
business and (b) none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has taken any
action that would have required the consent of Parent under clauses (i), (iv),
(vi), (vii), (ix), (xi), (xii), (xiii), (xiv) or (xv) of Section 5.1(b) of
this Agreement, had such action or event occurred after the date of this

subject to any investigation by any Governmental Entity with regard to any
Prohibited Payment, or (vi) violated or is in violation of any other Laws
regarding use of funds for political activity or commercial bribery.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has knowledge of any actual
or threatened enforcement action by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the
" _FDA_ ") or any other Governmental Entity which has jurisdiction over the
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and, since January 1,
2010, none has received notice of any pending or overtly threatened claim by
the FDA or any other Governmental Entity which has jurisdiction over the

(g) Since January 1, 2010, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have not
received any notices, information request letters, correspondence, or orders
from the FDA regarding new safety information, postmarketing clinical trials

to ensure the safety of the Companys or the Companys Subsidiaries products.

 



 

(h) All studies, tests and preclinical and clinical trials being conducted by
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries have been and are being conducted in
material compliance with experimental protocols, procedures and controls
pursuant to accepted professional scientific standards and applicable Laws,

caused to be initiated, conducted or issued, any recall, market withdrawal or
replacement, safety alert, warning, "dear doctor" letter, investigator notice
or other notice or action relating to an alleged lack of safety or efficacy of
any product or product candidate. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have no knowledge of any facts which would cause (i) the recall, market
withdrawal or replacement of any product sold or intended to be sold by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries; (ii) a change in the marketing
classification or a material change in labeling of any such products; or (iii)
a termination or suspension of marketing of any such products.

any comparable state Laws), or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such

(m) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, none of their officers, employees, agents or clinical
investigators has committed any act, made any statement or failed to make any
statement that would reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA to
invoke its policy with respect to "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts,
Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities" set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September
10, 1991) and any amendments thereto. Neither the Company, a Company

Company Subsidiaries have performed in all material respects their respective
covenants thereunder which are presently required to be performed and are not
in default under any of them, except for defaults or failures to perform which

termination of such agreement or result in a material liability for the
Company, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is any other party to any such
contract or other agreement in default thereunder, except for defaults which
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to result in
termination of such agreement or result in a material liability for the
Company, nor does any condition exist that with notice or lapse of time or
both would constitute a default thereunder, except for defaults which

Letter, none of the execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement, or

to in this Section 3.11 or (ii) create

 



      
 

 



 

obligations for, or alter obligations of, the Company, any Company Subsidiary,

3.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any Company

interest in any property or assets of the Company (except as a stockholder and
except for such compensation for service as an officer or director consistent
with that which is disclosed in Company SEC Reports) and except for
compensation for service of an officer or director) or a Company Subsidiary,

Subsidiary or any person that is currently a party to any material contract or
agreement with the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

3.12. _Property_.

 



 

(a) To the Companys knowledge, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries own,
are licensed to use, or otherwise have the right to use all patents,
trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights and all
other intellectual property (including, without limitation, biological
materials), all registrations of any of the foregoing, or applications
therefor, and all grants and licenses or other rights running to or from the
Company or a Company Subsidiary that are material to their businesses as
currently conducted (collectively, the " _Proprietary Rights_ "). To the
knowledge of the Company, the patents and patent applications, registered
trademarks and registered copyrights owned by or licensed to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and referred to above are subsisting and in good
standing. With respect to patents, registered trademarks and registered
copyrights owned by the Company, the Company has timely paid all maintenance
fees and annuities with respect thereto, and, as applicable, timely made such
filings, renewals, declarations, statements and certifications required to
maintain such items in good standing, except, in each case, where the Company
has determined in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment that such
patents, registered trademarks and registered copyrights are of no material
value to the Companys business, provided that if such determination was made
by the Company at any time after March 31, 2011, or is reasonably expected to
be made prior to the Effective Time, such rights are separately identified on
Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Letter. To the Companys knowledge, each of
the patents and patent applications owned by or licensed to the Company or
Company Subsidiaries identifies all of the true and correct inventors of the
applicable invention(s) claimed therein, and, to the Companys knowledge, the
Company, Company Subsidiary and each such inventor have complied with all
applicable duties of candor and good faith in their interaction with the
applicable patent office. To the Companys knowledge, assignment documents
have been executed and filed with relevant Governmental Entities as necessary
to transfer to the Company or a Company Subsidiary title to any of the
Companys owned Proprietary Rights consisting of patents, patent applications,
registered trademarks, registered copyrights and applications for registration
of trademarks and copyrights previously owned by a third party, and to record
such transfer. The named inventors of each of the Companys owned patent
applications have assigned the Companys owned patent applications to the
Company. On the expiration date of the Offer, the Company shall provide Parent
with a schedule of any Taxes, maintenance fees or actions falling due within
90 days of such expiration with respect to such patents, registered trademarks
and registered copyrights, and applications for issuance or registration of
any of the foregoing. To the Companys knowledge, the Company or Company
Subsidiary has the rights (1) to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for
products arising under the Proprietary Rights, (2) to enforce all Proprietary
Rights against third parties, except where the failure or inability to enforce
would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and
(3) with respect to the Proprietary Rights that have been licensed to the
Company or Company Subsidiary on an exclusive basis, to obtain, exercise,
assert and enforce the rights described in (1) and (2) above with the
cooperation, joinder and/or other assistance of the applicable licensor. To
the Companys knowledge, there is no reasonable basis for any claim by any
third party that the businesses of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, nor, to the Companys
knowledge, has the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or any Company Subsidiary received any charge, complaint, claim,
demand, or notice alleging any interference, infringement, misappropriation,
or conflict (including any claim that the Company, a Company Subsidiary or any
of their affiliates must license or refrain from using any intellectual
property rights). To the Companys knowledge, no third party has infringed
upon any of the Proprietary Rights. Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter identifies (i) all issued patents and registered trademarks that have
been issued to the Company or a Company Subsidiary, (ii) each pending
application therefor submitted by the Company or a Company Subsidiary (iii)
where known by the Company, all issued patents, registered trademarks and
pending applications therefor owned by a third party who has granted the
Company or a Company Subsidiary exclusive rights thereto (iv) each domain name
owned by the Company and (v) any application for patent term extension or
supplemental protection certificate with respect to (i) and (ii) above. In the
event that Company and any Company Subsidiary identify any pending or issued
patents and trademarks not identified in Section 3.12(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, Company will promptly notify Parent. To the knowledge of
the Company, neither the company nor any Company Subsidiary has agreed, or has
an obligation, to indemnify any third party for or against any interference,
infringement, misappropriation or other conflict involving the exploitation of
Proprietary Rights. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the activities of
the employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary on behalf of such
entity violates any agreement or arrangement which any such employees have
with former employers. To the knowledge of the Company, each employee,
contractor or consultant of the Company who has proprietary knowledge of or
information relating to the manufacturing processes, or the formulation of the
products, of the Company or a Company Subsidiary has executed and delivered to
the Company an agreement or agreements restricting such persons right to use
and disclose confidential information of the Company. To the Companys
knowledge, with respect to any patents owned by or licensed to the Company or
Company Subsidiary, there is no pending, decided, settled or threatened
opposition, interference proceeding, reexamination proceeding, cancellation
proceeding, injunction or other proceeding before any Governmental Entity
(collectively referred to hereinafter as " _Disputes_ "), challenging the
validity, enforceability or ownership of any such patent or the exploitation
of such patent and, to the knowledge of the Company, no circumstances or
grounds exist that would give rise to such a Dispute. Except as would not be
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, there are no
settlements, forbearances to sue, consents, judgments, or orders or similar
obligations to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party that: (i)
restrict the use by the Company or Company Subsidiary of any Proprietary
Rights; (ii) restrict the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its
employees; or (iii) grant third parties any material rights under Proprietary
Rights. To the knowledge of the Company and except as would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no material trade secret of
the Company has been disclosed or authorized to be disclosed to any third
party in violation of confidentiality obligations to the Company and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no party to a nondisclosure agreement with the
Company is in breach or default thereof. No current or former director,
officer, consultant or employee of the Company will, after giving effect to
the Offer and the Merger, own any of the Proprietary Rights. To the knowledge
of the Company and except as would not be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the execution of, the delivery of, the consummation
of the Offer and Merger contemplated by, and the performance of the Companys
obligations under, this Agreement will not result in any loss or impairment of
any Proprietary Rights. To the knowledge of the Company, neither government
funding nor

 



      
 

 



 

government, academic or non-profit research facilities were used in the
development of any of the patent applications owned by the Company. The
representations and warranties in Sections 3.11(d) and 3.12(a) are the sole
and exclusive representations and warranties of the Company with respect to
Proprietary Rights, and no other representation or warranty in Section 3
hereunder shall be construed to pertain to Proprietary Rights.

 



 

(b) With respect to property other than Proprietary Rights, the Company and
each Company Subsidiary has all assets, properties, rights and contracts
necessary to permit the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to conduct their
business as it is currently being conducted, except where the failure to have
such assets, properties, rights and contracts would not be reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary has good, clear and marketable title to all of its properties,
interests in properties and assets, real and personal, reflected in the
Company Balance Sheet (except properties, interests in properties and assets
sold or otherwise disposed of since the date of the Company Balance Sheet in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), or with
respect to leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in such
properties and assets, in each case, free and clear of all imperfections of
title, restrictions, encroachments, liens and easements, except (i) liens for
current Taxes not yet due and payable, that are payable without penalty or
that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceeding and for which
an adequate reserve has been established on the Company Balance Sheet in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (ii) such
imperfections of title, restrictions, encroachments, liens and easements as do
not materially detract from or interfere with the use or value of the
properties subject thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise materially impair
business operations involving such properties, (iii) liens securing debt which
are reflected on the Company Balance Sheet and (iv) with respect to leased
real property, any liens placed or suffered to be placed on the fee estate
underlying such leasehold. There are no written or oral subleases, licenses,
occupancy agreements or other contractual obligations that grant the right of
use or occupancy of any real property leased by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Real Property_ "), and there is no person in
possession of the Real Property other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company has not received written notice of any pending or
threatened eminent domain, condemnation or similar proceeding affecting any
Real Property leased by the Company or a Company Subsidiary. To the knowledge
of the Company, the property and equipment of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary that are used in the operations of business are (i) in good
operating condition and repair and (ii) have been maintained in accordance
with normal industry practices, except where the failure to maintain such
property and equipment would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists all Real Property leased by the Company or a Company Subsidiary. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns any Real Property.

 



 

3.13. _Insurance_. All policies or binders of material fire, liability,
product liability, workers compensation, vehicular, directors and officers
and other material insurance held by or on behalf of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries are in full force and effect in all material respects,
are reasonably adequate for the businesses engaged in by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and are in conformity in all material respects with the
requirements of all leases or other agreements to which the Company or the
relevant Company Subsidiary is a party and, to the knowledge of the Company,
are valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms.

 



      
 

 



 

Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in default in any material
respect with respect to any provision contained in such policy or binder nor
has any of the Company or a Company Subsidiary failed to give any notice or
present any material claim under any such policy or binder in due and timely
fashion. All premiums for each policy or binder have been paid for the current
period, and there are no outstanding premium finance payments due for such
period. There are no material outstanding unpaid claims under any such policy
or binder. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received notice
of cancellation or non-renewal of any such policy or binder. All applications
for the Companys currently effective directors and officers insurance were
true, correct and complete in all material respects when submitted to the
carrier. No coverage limits of insurance policies covering the Company or a
Company Subsidiary have been exhausted.

 



 

3.14. _Commercial Relationships_. Except as disclosed in Section 3.14 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, during the last twelve months, none of the
Companys or the Company Subsidiaries material suppliers, collaborators,
distributors, licensors or licensees has canceled or otherwise terminated its
relationship with the Company or a Company Subsidiary or has materially
altered its relationship with the Company or a Company Subsidiary. To the
knowledge of the Company, the Company has not received written notice from any
such entity, to terminate, cancel or otherwise materially modify its
relationship with the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

 



 

3.15. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Tax_ " (and, with correlative
meaning, " _Taxes_ " and " _Taxable_ ") means all United States federal, state
and local, and all non-U.S., income, profits, franchise, gross receipts,
payroll, transfer, sales, employment, social security (or similar),
unemployment insurance, workers compensation, use, property, excise, value
added, ad valorem, estimated, stamp, alternative or add-on minimum, recapture,
capital, escheat, unclaimed property, withholding and any other taxes,
charges, duties, impositions or assessments, and any other taxes, fees,
charges, levies, excises, duties or similar assessments, together with all
interest, penalties and additions imposed on or with respect to such amounts.
" _Tax Return_ " means any return, declaration, report, claim for refund or
information return or statement filed or required to be filed with any taxing
authority in connection with the determination, assessment, collection or
imposition of any Taxes, including any attachments thereto and any amendments
thereof.

 



 

(b) All federal income Tax Returns and other material Tax Returns required to
be filed by or with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been
timely and properly filed. All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all material respects, and all material Taxes due and payable by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, whether or not shown on any Tax Return,
have been paid except for those Taxes that are being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings and for which an adequate reserve has been
established on the Company Balance Sheet in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries file Tax
Returns in all jurisdictions where they are required to so file, and no
written claim has ever been made by any taxing authority in any jurisdiction
where the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries are or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) No material Tax audit is currently pending or threatened in writing with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor have any deficiencies
for any Taxes been proposed, asserted, threatened or assessed in writing
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary which have not been fully paid
or adequately reserved for on the Company Balance Sheet in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has in force any extension
or waiver of any statute of limitations of any jurisdiction regarding the
assessment or collection of any material Tax of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except in each case with respect to Taxes that are being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which an adequate reserve has
been established on the Company Balance Sheet in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

 



 

(e) With respect to any period for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed,
or for which Taxes are not yet due or owing, the Company has, in accordance
with and at such times as required by generally accepted accounting
principles, made due and sufficient accruals or reserves for all material
Taxes for such period (excluding any "deferred taxes" or similar items that
reflect timing differences between tax and financial accounting principles) in
the Companys books and records, including the Company Balance Sheet.

 



 

(f) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have withheld all material
amounts required by Law or contract to be withheld from the wages, salaries or
other payments to (i) employees, independent contractors, creditors,
stockholders of or consultants to the Company and (ii) any other third party.
Such withheld amounts were either duly paid to the appropriate taxing
authority to the extent due and payable or, to the extent not due and payable,
adequately reserved for on the Company Balance Sheet in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all record keeping
and reporting requirements in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party.

 



 

(g) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are not a party to or bound by,
nor do they have any obligation under, any material Tax sharing agreement or
similar contract or arrangement or other agreement under which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary may have a material liability for Taxes of a third-
party (other than such an agreement or contract exclusively between or among
any of the Company and wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiaries of the
Company and other than customary Tax indemnifications contained in credit
agreements that do not principally relate to Tax). Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has any material liability for the Taxes of any other
person (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any payments that
will, upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, be
deemed to have included, or is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement
or plan that could reasonably be expected to result in the payment of, any
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or
any corresponding provisions of state, local or non-

 



      
 

 



 

U.S. Tax Law). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to,
or is otherwise obligated under, any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
that provides for the gross up of a Tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code
(or any corresponding provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law).

 



 

(i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been or is a party to
any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan (i) that as to any tax period
commencing prior to the date hereof for which an income tax return has not
been filed as of the date hereof has resulted, or (ii) that as to any
subsequent tax period ending on or prior to the Effective Time could result,
in any payment or benefit that was not or would not be deductible for federal
income tax purposes by reason of the deduction limit imposed by Section 162(m)
of the Code.

 



 

(j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has, within the past seven
years, distributed stock of another corporation, or has had its stock
distributed by another corporation, in a transaction that was governed, or
purported or intended to be governed, in whole or in part, by Sections 355 or
361 of the Code.

 



 

(k) Since December 31, 2005, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has (i) changed any Tax accounting methods, policies or practices of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, except as required by regulations
or guidelines or applicable Law or otherwise disclosed in a Tax Return, (ii)
changed or amended any material Tax election of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, (iii) filed any amended federal income or material state
income Tax Return or claim for refund of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or (iv) settled or compromised any material federal income or
material state income Tax liability or refund of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

(l) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
all Tax Returns, examination reports, Code Section 382 studies prepared by a
nationally recognized accounting firm and statements of deficiencies assessed
against or agreed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary filed or
received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary since December 31, 2008,
which have been requested in writing by Parent prior to the date hereof.

 



 

(m) No closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) has been entered into by or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that will have continuing
effect after the Closing Date.

 



 

(n) Since December 31, 2010 and through the date hereof, neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has filed for or requested any adjustments
pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state or
local law that will result in a material amount of Tax by reason of a change
in accounting method.

 



 

(o) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries will be required
to include any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of
deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending after the Closing Date as a result of any: (i) installment sale or open
transaction disposition made on or prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date or (ii) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date
except for amounts for which the Company has reserved an amount for or
accounted for as a deferred tax liability.

 



 

(p) Other than as shown on any Tax Return, neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has engaged in any "reportable transaction" identified
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b) or any corresponding or
similar provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Law that have not previously
been reported on a Tax Return.

 



 

(q) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is party to any material
written agreement, contract or arrangement that could be treated as a
partnership for federal state, local or non-U.S. Tax purposes (other than
those specified in Section 3.4(a) or 3.4(c)).

 



 

3.16. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each "benefit plan"
(as hereinafter defined) (i) that is maintained, contributed (or required to
be contributed) to, or sponsored by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or
(ii) to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, or (iii) with
respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any liability,
including any contingent liability (collectively, the " _Plans_ "). For
purposes of the preceding sentence, a "benefit plan" is any of the following
that benefits or is intended to benefit any current or former employee,
director, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate (as defined in Section 3.16(b)), or the beneficiaries or dependents
of any such Person: (A) an "employee benefit plan" described in Section 3(3)

been reduced to writing, a written summary of all material Plan terms, (2) in
the case of any funded Plan, the trust agreement or similar instrument, (3)
for each Plan subject to the requirement that annual reports be filed on a
Form 5500, the three most recently filed annual reports, with schedules,
financial statements and auditors opinion attached, if applicable, (4) in the
case of each Company Stock Plan, form agreements evidencing outstanding
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock, Time-Vested DSUs and Performance-
Vested DSUs (and, in each case, if individual agreements deviate in any
material respect from the form, the individual agreements), (5) in the case of
each Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most
recent Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") determination or opinion letter
applicable to the Plan (plus, if a request for a determination letter is
pending, a copy of such request), (6) related custodial agreements, insurance
policies (including fiduciary liability insurance covering the fiduciaries of
the Plan), administrative services and similar agreements, and investment
advisory or investment management agreements, if any, and (7) copies of the
most recent summary plan description

 



      
 

 



 

(including any summaries of material modifications issued since the last
summary plan description) or similar summary and any employee handbook.

 



 

(b) During the past six years, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or any other person that together with the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is or was treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o)
of the Code (each, together with the Company and any Company Subsidiary, an "
_ERISA Affiliate_ ") has contributed or been required to contribute to or has
sponsored, maintained or participated in, and neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has any liability (nor does any circumstance exist that could
result in any liability to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate) with respect
to, (i) a pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject
to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a "multiemployer plan"
(within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or (iii) a
"voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code or a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of
Section 419(e) of the Code.

 



 

(c) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code is the subject of a favorable determination or opinion letter from the
IRS. No such determination or opinion letter has been revoked or to the
Companys knowledge been threatened to be revoked, and to the Companys
knowledge, no event has occurred nor does any circumstance exist that could
reasonably be expected to result in any loss of qualification under Section
401(a) of the Code for any Plan that is intended so to be qualified.

 



 

(d) Each Plan, including any associated trust or fund, has been maintained and
administered at all times in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Law (including, where applicable, non-U.S. Law). To the Companys
knowledge, nothing has occurred with respect to any Plan that has subjected or
could reasonably be expected to subject the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, or
any Plan participant or beneficiary to any material tax or penalty under
Sections 409 or 502 of ERISA or Chapter 43 of the Code. All filings and
reports with respect to each Plan required to have been submitted to the IRS,
the United States Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity have
been properly and timely submitted, except where failure to do so would not
result in a material liability.

 



 

(e) No Plan provides health, life or disability insurance, or other welfare
benefits to former employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligation to provide
any such benefits to any current employee following retirement or other
termination of employment, in each case except for group health plan benefit
continuation coverage to the extent required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA.

 



 

(f) No administrative investigation, inquiry, audit or other proceeding by the
IRS, Department of Labor, or other Governmental Entity, and no other lawsuit,
claim, or other controversy, other than routine claims for benefits (including
under domestic relations orders) in the ordinary course, is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan. No Plan is the
subject of an application or filing under, or is a participant in, a
government-sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance, self-correction or similar
program.

 



       
 

 



 

(g) Each of the Company and Company Subsidiary, and to the Companys
knowledge, each third-party plan administrator, has at all relevant times
properly classified each provider of services to the Company and each Company
Subsidiary as an employee or independent contractor, as the case may be, for
all purposes relating to each Plan for which such classification could be
relevant, except as could not reasonably be expected to give rise to a
material liability.

 



 

(h) The Company is not a party to, nor is it otherwise obligated under, any
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the gross up by the
Company of any Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or Section 409A(b) of the
Code.

 



 

(i) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with any separation from service or other
triggering event under the applicable arrangement, (i) entitle any employee,
director, officer, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of compensation due to any such employee, director, officer, consultant
or independent contractor, (iii) directly or indirectly cause the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any
benefits under any Plan, or (iv) otherwise give rise to a material liability
under any Plan.

 



 

(j) Each Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued by the
Company after the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of such Plan and
without the consent of any other person or any increase in payments or
benefits on account of such action, except where failure to do so would not
result in a material liability.

 



 

(k) None of the Plans is (or, if it were an "employee benefit plan" as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA, would be) described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA.

 



 

3.17. _Employee Relations_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
all employees are employed on an "at-will" basis such that employment can be

title, date of hire/election and base salary for each of the last two years of

ordinary course) or any taxes or any penalty for failure to comply with any of
the foregoing, (iv) is not liable for any payment to any trust or other fund

respect of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened. To the Companys knowledge, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or threatened with any
governmental investigation, administrative charge or litigation involving any
employee, consultant or independent contractor or by or before any
Governmental Entity concerning Laws in respect of labor and employment,
including without limitation charges of unfair labor practices or
discrimination complaints, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Since January 1, 2011, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act or any analogous Law, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is presently a party to or
bound by any collective bargaining agreement or other contract with a labor
union, works council or similar organization other than as set forth in
Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter and no such agreement or
contract is being negotiated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. To the
Companys knowledge, no effort by or on behalf of any labor union to organize

before the National Relations Board or other labor relations board seeking
recognition or certification of a bargaining representative for any employee
or group of employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) Section 3.17(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all
individuals currently engaged by the Company to perform services as

or in a manner which would reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability for the Company or the Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) Except for matters that have been fully resolved or as would not
reasonably be expected to result in material liability of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has

Subsidiary is necessary to respond to a Release or a threatened Release of any
Hazardous Material. No site or premises owned, operated or leased by the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries is listed, or to the Companys knowledge,

standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is or becomes a party. The Company will promptly provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries provided or made available pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) which
was not previously provided or made available to Parent. For purposes of this
Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " is an unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal, that the Company Board of Directors believes in good faith is _bona
fide_ , to acquire more than fifty percent (50%) of the equity securities or
consolidated total assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant
to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation, business combination
or recapitalization, or a sale or license of its assets, (A) on terms which
the Company Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment to be
more favorable to the holders of Shares than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (after consultation with its financial and legal advisors),
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement, including the timing and likelihood of consummating the
transactions contemplated by such proposal and this Agreement, and (B) which
the Company Board of Directors has determined to be reasonably capable of
being completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth herein, neither the Company Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly
propose to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board of Directors or any such committee of the
Offer, this Agreement, or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action referred
to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Change_ ") or (iii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, or similar agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "),
providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 5.2(b) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section
5.2(b)). The Company shall, promptly following a determination by the Company
Board of Directors that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify
Parent of such determination.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2 to the contrary, prior to the
Acceptance Time, if (i) the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal
from a third party that the Company Board of Directors believes in good faith
is _bona fide_ , (ii) a knowing material breach by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary of this Section 5.2 has not resulted in the making of such
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) the Company Board of Directors concludes in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after
giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which
may be committed to by Parent, the Company Board of Directors may, if it
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law, (A) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (B) terminate this
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such
termination the Company (1) pays the fee required by and pursuant to the terms
of Section 8.2 and (2) within two (2) business days following such termination
enters into a binding definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such
Superior Proposal; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board of
Directors may not effect a change of its recommendation pursuant to the
foregoing clause (A) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (B) unless (1) the Company or a Company Subsidiary or Representative
shall not have materially breached this Section 5.2 in connection with the
making of such Acquisition Proposal, (2) the Company shall have provided prior
written notice to Parent, at least four (4) business days in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with respect to such
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a
copy of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, (3) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change
or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Notice Period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to permit Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (4) following any negotiation described in
the immediately preceding clause (3), such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the
financial terms of the Superior Proposal after the start of the Notice Period,
the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
comply with the requirements of this Section 5.2 with respect to such new
written notice, and the Notice Period shall be deemed to have re-commenced on
the date of such new notice. Notwithstanding

 



      
 

 



 

the foregoing, if fewer than four (4) business days remains before the then
scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the Notice Period with respect to the
Company Board of Directors effecting a change of its recommendation pursuant
to the foregoing clause (A) shall not apply, _provided_ , _however_ , that, in
such a circumstance, the Notice Period with respect to the Company terminating
this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall remain four (4)
business days. Any Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval
of the Company Board of Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover
statute or other Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including each of the Offer and the Merger, or to the Tender
and Voting Agreements.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board of Directors may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in the absence of an Acquisition Proposal if the
Company Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation
with its outside counsel, that an Adverse Recommendation Change is necessary
to comply with its fiduciary duties, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company has (A) provided to Parent at least four (4) business days prior
written notice (or such shorter period as remains prior to one day prior to
the scheduled expiration date of the Offer) advising Parent that the Company
Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the reasons
therefore in reasonable detail and (B) during such four (4) business day, or
shorter, period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations
with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need or
reason for the Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

SECTION 6 - ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 



 

6.1. _Proxy Statement_. If required by the Exchange Act, the Company shall, as
soon as practicable following the expiration of the Offer, prepare and file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company,
Parent and Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The
Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of
the adoption of this Agreement by the required vote of the holders of the
outstanding Shares (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ ") there shall occur
any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement to the
extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall not mail any Proxy
Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably
objects. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
practicable after filing with the SEC. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Proxy Statement shall contain the recommendation of the
Company Board of Directors in favor of the Merger.

 



 

6.2. _Meeting of Stockholders of the Company_. If, following the Tender
Completion Time, the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares is
required under the DGCL in

 



      
 

 



 

order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall take all actions in
accordance with applicable Law, the Companys certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market to promptly and duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable, a Special
Meeting. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Tender Completion Time_
" means the latest to occur of (x) the Acceptance Time, (y) the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares or the failure by Sub to exercise the Top-Up
Option during the exercise period provided in Section 1.10 and (z) if a
subsequent offering period is commenced by Sub, the expiration of such
subsequent offering period.

 



 

6.3. _Nasdaq; Post-Closing SEC Reports_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws and rules and policies of The Nasdaq Stock Market to enable the delisting
by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from The Nasdaq Stock Market and
the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act promptly after the
Effective Time. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Surviving Corporation to file with the SEC (a) a Form 25 on the Closing Date
and (b) a Form 15 on the first business day that is at least ten (10) days
after the date the Form 25 is filed (such period between the Form 25 filing
date and the Form 15 filing date, the " _Delisting Period_ "). If the
Surviving Corporation is reasonably likely to be required to file any reports
pursuant to the Exchange Act during the Delisting Period, the Company will
deliver to Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing a
substantially final draft of any such reports reasonably likely to be required
to be filed during the Delisting Period (" _Post-Closing SEC Reports_ "). The
Post-Closing SEC Reports provided by the Company pursuant to this Section 6.3
will (i) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading and (ii) comply in all material respects with
the provisions of applicable Laws.

 



 

6.4. _Access to Information_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled, through its employees and representatives, to have such access to
the assets, properties, business and operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with Parents investigation of the Company with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except as prohibited by
applicable Law. Any such investigation and examination shall be conducted at
reasonable times during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice
and under reasonable circumstances so as to limit disruption to or impairment
of the Companys business; provided, however, such investigation and
examination shall not include the right to conduct any sampling or testing,
including any so-called Phase II testing, of the properties. No investigation
by Parent shall diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement. The
Company shall furnish the representatives of Parent during such period with
all such information and copies of such documents concerning the affairs of
the Company as such representatives may reasonably request and cause its
Representatives to cooperate fully with such representatives of Parent in
connection with such investigation. The information and documents so provided
shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or disclose information designated as
competitively sensitive or where the Company reasonably determines that such
access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
Company or

 



      
 

 



 

any of its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or any contract entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement and listed in Section 6.4 of the
Disclosure Letter to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

 



 

6.5. _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning the Offer and
the Merger shall be a joint press release and, thereafter, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, neither Parent, Sub nor the Company will disseminate
any press release or other announcement concerning the Merger, the Offer or
this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any
third party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with
a national stock exchange, without the prior consent of each of the other
parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld conditioned
or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may disseminate press
releases or other announcements regarding an Acquisition Proposal or Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with the terms of Section 5.2 without the
prior consent of Parent or Sub. The parties have agreed to the text of the
joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without prior consent of the other party, each
party (a) may communicate information that is not confidential information of
the other party with financial analysts, investors and media representatives
in a manner consistent with its past practice in compliance with applicable
Law and (b) may disseminate material substantially similar to material
included in a press release or other document previously approved for external
distribution by the other parties. Each party agrees to promptly make
available to the other parties copies of any written communications made
without prior consultation with the other parties.

 



 

6.6. _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof and in compliance with
all applicable regulatory requirements, each of Parent, Sub and the Company
shall make all filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, application or submission of other documents
required by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation:
(i) Notification and Report Forms with the United States Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice as required by the HSR Act, (ii) filings required by the merger
notification or control Laws of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed by the
parties hereto, and (iii) any filings required under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any applicable state or securities or "blue sky" Laws and the

and regulations of any Governmental Entity relating to the Offer and the
Merger. Each of Parent and the Company will cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with any Governmental Entity under this Section 6.6 to

any information which may be reasonably required in order to effectuate any
filings or applications pursuant to this Section 6.6.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent, Sub and the Company will notify the others promptly upon
the receipt of: (i) any communication or comments from any officials of any

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and
(ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or
supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to comply
in all material respects with, any applicable Laws and rules and regulations
of any Governmental Entity. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section
6.6(a), Parent, Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform
the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable
Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

 



 

(d) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including complying in all material respects with all applicable Laws
and with all rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity and using its
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the causing of all
the conditions set forth in SECTION 7 and in all of the Offer Conditions to be
satisfied and to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the obtaining of all reasonably
requested actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all
reasonably requested registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any),
(iii) the obtaining of all reasonably requested consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v) the
execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, and to carry out fully the purposes of,
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Offer, the Merger,
this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby. In case at any
time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of
the Company, Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all such necessary actions. Parent shall cause Sub to
fulfill all Subs obligations under, and pursuant to, this Agreement. Nothing
in this Agreement shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
subsidiary of Parent to sell, hold separate, license or otherwise dispose of
any assets or conduct their business in a specified manner, or agree or
proffer to sell, hold separate, license or otherwise dispose of any assets or
conduct their business in a specified manner, or permit or agree to the sale,
holding separate, licensing or other disposition of, any assets of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent or the Company,
whether as a condition to obtaining any approval from, or to avoid potential

 



      
 

 



 

litigation or administrative action by, a Governmental Entity or any other
person or for any other reason.

 



 

6.7. _Notification of Certain Matters; Litigation_. Each party shall give
prompt notice to the other parties of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event of which such party has knowledge the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which would cause any representation or warranty made by such party in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from
the date hereof to the Effective Time, (b) any Offer Condition that is
unsatisfied at any time from the date hereof to the Acceptance Time of which
such party has knowledge (other than the condition contained in clause (i) of
the first paragraph of the Offer Conditions, as to which such notice shall be
given if such condition is unsatisfied as of any scheduled expiration date of
the Offer), and (c) any material failure of such party or any of its
Representatives to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder of which such party has
knowledge; ___provided_ , _however_ _,_ that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or the
remedies available to the party receiving such notification. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party shall, within twenty-four (24) hours after it has
notice of any of the following notify the other parties of (i) any notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii)
any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings instituted or
threatened against such party or any of its directors, officers or Affiliates,
including by any stockholder of such party, before any court or Governmental
Entity, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the such party or any
of its Subsidiaries which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking
damages or discovery in connection with such transactions. Parent shall have
the right to participate in, but not control, the defense of any such actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings under clause (iii) above with
respect to the Company, and the Company shall consult with Parent regarding
the defense or settlement of any such actions, suits, claims, investigations
or proceedings and shall consider Parents views with respect to such actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings.

 



 

6.8. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that any rights to indemnification or exculpation (including
the payment of reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation) now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company and the current or former directors or officers of each Company
Subsidiary (the " _Indemnified Parties_ " and, each, an " _Indemnified Party_
") as provided in their respective organizational documents, in effect as of
the date hereof, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, and Parent
guarantees any such obligations of the Surviving Corporation. During such
period, Parent shall not, nor shall it permit the Surviving Corporation to,
amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification in any
manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights

 



       
 

 



 

thereunder of individuals who at any time on or prior to the Effective Time
were directors or officers of the Company or directors or officers of any of
Company Subsidiary in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or
made either prior to the Effective Time or within such six (6) year period,
all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of any and all such claims. Parent guarantees the
payment of any obligation of the Surviving Corporation to indemnify an
Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) maintain, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company (the " _Current D andO Insurance_") with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the annual premium
therefor would not be in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last
annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such three hundred percent
(300%), the " _Maximum Premium_ "), or (ii) purchase a six (6) year extended
reporting period endorsement with respect to the Current DandO Insurance (a "
_Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain such endorsement in full force
and effect for its full term, _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the
Surviving Corporation taking any actions in clauses (i) or (ii) above, Parent
shall be provided the opportunity to purchase, in lieu thereof, a substitute
policy with the same coverage limits and substantially similar terms as in the
Reporting Tail Endorsement proposed to be purchased by the Surviving
Corporation. If the Companys or the Surviving Corporations existing
insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six (6) year period
or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and
officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such
period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance.

 



 

(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall cause
proper provision to be made so that such successors and assigns shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his
or her Representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have from the Company or any other Person by contract or otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

6.9. _Directors_.

 



 

(a) Promptly upon the first acceptance for payment pursuant to the Offer of
Shares that represent at least a majority of the issued and outstanding
Shares, and the transfer of funds to a paying agent to cover the Closing
Amount with respect to such Shares, Parent shall be entitled to designate such
number of directors on the Company Board of Directors as will give Parent,
subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation
on the Company Board of Directors equal to at least that number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, which is the product of (x) the total
number of directors on the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the
directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (y) the percentage
that (I) such number of Shares so accepted for payment by Sub and with respect
to which funds were transferred to a paying agent to cover the Closing Amount
plus the number of Shares otherwise owned by Parent, Sub, or any other
subsidiary of Parent bears to (II) the number of such Shares outstanding, and
the Company shall, at such time, cause Parents designees to be so elected;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that in the event that Parents designees are
appointed or elected to the Company Board of Directors, until the Effective
Time, the Company Board of Directors shall have at least three (3) directors
who are directors on the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of
the Company and are independent directors for purposes of The Nasdaq Stock
Market listing requirements (the " _Independent Directors_ "); and _provided_
, _further_ , that, in such event, if the number of Independent Directors
shall be reduced below three (3) for any reason whatsoever, any remaining
Independent Directors (or Independent Director, if there shall be only one
remaining) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who
shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or,
if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate
three persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers or affiliates of the
Company and are independent directors for purposes of The Nasdaq Stock Market
listing requirements, Parent or Sub, and such persons shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. At such time, the
Company shall, upon Parents request, also cause persons elected or designated
by Parent to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole
number) as is on the Company Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the
Company Board of Directors, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of
each of the Companys Subsidiaries, and (iii) each committee (or similar body)
of each such board, in each case only to the extent required by applicable Law
or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Shares are listed. Subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall take all action requested by Parent
necessary to effect any such election, including mailing to its stockholders
the Information Statement containing the information required by Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and the Company
shall make such mailing with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that
Parent and Sub shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis, and shall
be solely responsible for, all information required to be included in the
Information Statement with respect to Parents and Subs designees). In
connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at the option of
Sub, either increase the size of the Company Board of Directors or obtain the
resignation of such number of its current directors, or both, as is necessary
to enable Subs designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board of
Directors as provided above.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parents
designees constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors after the
Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of
a majority of the Independent

 



      
 

 



 

Directors (or if only one (1) exists, then the vote of such Independent
Director) shall be required to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement by the
Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or
remedies hereunder, if such action would materially and adversely affect
holders of Shares other than Parent or Sub, (iii) amend the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, or (iv) take any other action of the
Company Board of Directors under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that if there
shall be no Independent Directors as a result of such persons deaths,
disabilities or refusal to serve, then such actions may be effected by
majority vote of the entire Company Board of Directors.

 



 

6.10. _401(k)_. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not (i) make any contribution to the Companys 401(k) plan other than as
consistent with past practice or required under the terms of such plan as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or (ii) make any required contribution
to the Companys 401(k) plan in Shares. If requested by Parent in writing
prior to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the Company shall, not
later than the day before the day on which the Acceptance Time occurs (but
subject to the occurrence of the Acceptance Time), terminate the Companys
401(k) plan.

 



 

6.11. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Each employee of the Company as of the Acceptance Time (i) who is a
participant in the Companys performance-based Incentive Compensation Plan
(the " _Incentive Compensation Plan_ ") shall be entitled to receive from the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be, the
amount of any bonus payable to such employee under the Incentive Compensation
Plan for calendar year 2011, calculated assuming target achievement by the
Company and such employee of all applicable performance goals, if any, and
(ii) who is a participant in the Companys Account Manager, Regional Sales
Director and National Sales Director Field Sales Incentive Compensation Plan
for Trimester 3 (September  December 2011) (the " _Sales Incentive

_IC Plans_ ") shall be entitled to receive from the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be, the greater of (y) the amount
of any bonus payable to such employee under the Sales Incentive Compensation
Plan for such trimester, calculated assuming target achievement by the Company
and such employee of all applicable performance goals, if any, and (z) the
actual amount of goal attainment for such employee under such plan. The amount
of bonus payable under this Section 6.11(a)(i) or (ii) herein shall be paid at
the earlier of (i) such time as such bonus otherwise would have been paid to
such employee by the Company consistent with past practice and (ii) such time
as the employee is terminated by the Surviving Corporation or Parent. Section
6.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the 2011 target bonus
amounts and percentages for each employee as of the date of this Agreement. In
addition, each such employee shall have an aggregate potential bonus
opportunity for calendar year 2012 no less favorable than the percentage bonus
opportunity available to such employee in 2011, as set forth in Section
6.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) At least until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, each employee
of the Company who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation
during such period (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall be provided a base
salary at a rate no less than the rate of the

 



      
 

 



 

annual base salary provided to such Continuing Employee on the date hereof and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
benefits provided to similarly situated Parent employees based on levels of
responsibility.

 



 

(c) Each Continuing Employee who participates in (or is otherwise eligible
for) any such Company plan immediately prior to the Acceptance Time will
receive service credit for all periods of employment with the Company or
Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time for purposes
of vesting, eligibility and (only for purposes of determining the amount of
vacation and Severance (as defined in Section 6.11(d) below)) benefit levels
under any Parent employee plan in which such employee participates after the
Effective Time, to the same extent and for the same purposes thereunder as
such service was recognized under an analogous Company compensation plan in
effect on the date hereof. If on or after the Effective Time, any Continuing
Employee becomes covered under any benefit plan providing medical, dental,
health, pharmaceutical or vision benefits (a "Successor Plan"), other than the
plan in which he or she participated immediately prior to the Effective Time
(a "Prior Plan"), Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that (i) such Continuing Employee shall not be subject to any
restrictions or limitations with respect to pre-existing condition exclusions,
waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements (except to the extent such
exclusions or requirements were applicable under the corresponding Prior Plan)
and (ii) such Continuing Employee shall be permitted to take into account any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the plan year in which the employee elects to be covered under the
Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and/or his or
her covered dependents for that year, to the extent that such expenses were
incurred during the applicable plan year in which such employee or covered
dependent was covered under a corresponding Prior Plan.

 



 

(d) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide severance
benefits (" _Severance_ ") to each Continuing Employee whose employment is
terminated by the Surviving Corporation without Cause (as defined in this
Section 6.11(d)) or by reason of a reduction in the workforce or job
elimination, in each case at any time prior to the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, other than an employee who is eligible for participation in
the Companys Executive Severance Pay Program, or who has a binding
contractual right to severance benefits pursuant to any agreement with the
Company, (each a " _Terminated Employee_ "), subject to the Terminated
Employees providing a timely and effective release of claims in favor of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Parent (the " _Employee Release_
"). Severance shall be paid to such Terminated Employee in an amount equal to
twelve weeks Base Pay (as defined in this Section 6.11(d)) plus an additional
week of base pay for each year of continuing service by such Terminated
Employee to the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and its Affiliates.
For the avoidance of doubt, a Terminated Employees years of continuing
service shall be rounded up to the nearest whole year in calculating the
number of additional weeks of Base Pay that are added to the twelve weeks of
Base Pay. Severance shall be paid to each Terminated Employee in the form of a
lump sum cash payment, as soon as reasonably practicable (taking into account
the requirement of a release) following the Terminated Employees date of
termination. For purposes of this Section 6.11(d), "Base Pay" shall mean the
weekly base salary of the Terminated Employee on the date of his or her
termination of employment. No such Severance payments shall be made if the
Terminated

 



      
 

 



 

Employee is terminated for Cause. "Cause" shall mean (i) fraud,
misappropriation or embezzlement against the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
its Affiliates, (ii) falsification of records or similar acts, (iii) gross
neglect of or willful failure to perform substantial job duties, (iv)
commission of a felony or other crime involving dishonesty, violence or moral
turpitude, or (v) insubordination, defined as the refusal by an employee to
follow managements rational and lawful instructions regarding a job-related
matter.

 



 

(e) If a Terminated Employee elects COBRA continuation coverage, then for a
period of three months beginning on the first day of the month immediately
following the month of the Terminated Employees date of termination or until
the Terminated Employees eligibility for such coverage ceases, if earlier,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) pay the full cost
of such coverage or (ii) if Parent determines that payment of such cost could
result in any penalty or tax to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, pay
additional severance to the Terminated Employee in an amount equal to such
cost. In addition, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide outplacement services to each Terminated Employee for a period of six
months and for each employee who is eligible for participation in the
Companys Executive Severance Pay Program for a period of twelve months. All
payments to or on behalf of a Terminated Employee under this Section 6.11
shall be conditioned on the employee providing an Employee Release.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be construed
or applied so as to require Parent or any of its subsidiaries to continue any
plan or to continue the employment of any Person. No provision of this
Agreement shall be construed to create any right to any compensation or
benefits on the part of any Continuing Employee or other future, present or
former employee of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
subsidiaries or be deemed to make any employee of the parties or their
respective subsidiaries a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, including
this Section 6.11, or any rights relating hereto. No provision of this Section
6.11 is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or
an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise
or shall be construed or applied so as to result in a duplication of benefits
or payments.

 



 

6.12. _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination" or
"control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is
or becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any such statute or regulation on such transactions.

 



 

6.13. _FIRPTA Certificate. _Prior to each of the Acceptance Time and the
Effective Time, the Company shall execute and deliver to Parent and Sub a
certificate (in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and Sub) conforming to
the requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and
1.897-2(h).

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 7 - CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE OBLIGATION OF PARTIES TO CONSUMMATE
THE MERGER

or making illegal the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(c) _Consummation of the Offer_. The Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall have been accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer and the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that neither Parent

purchase any of the Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer.

 



 

SECTION 8 - TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 



 

8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time before the Effective Time,
whether before or after stockholder approval thereof:

 



 

(a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company duly authorized by the
Board of Directors of Parent and the Company Board of Directors; or

 



 

(b) By either Parent or the Company:

 



 

(i) if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, and such
order, decree or ruling or other action shall have become final and non-
appealable, or there shall exist any statute, rule or regulation, in each
case, permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
(collectively, " _Restraints_ ") the consummation of the Offer or the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall have used its reasonable best efforts
to prevent the entry of and to remove such Restraints and complied with
Section 6.6; or

 



 

(ii) if the Acceptance Time has not occurred by the date that is four (4)
months after the date hereof (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose action or failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the principal cause of,
or resulted in, the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur by such date; or

 



      
 

 



 

(c) By Parent if, (i) there has been a breach by the Company of, or inaccuracy
in, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set
forth in this Agreement (A) which would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in clause (c) or (d) of Annex I and (B) such breach or
inaccuracy is not capable of being cured; or (ii) due to an occurrence or
circumstance that has resulted in a failure to satisfy any Offer Condition
that is not capable of being cured, Sub shall have allowed the Offer to
terminate, without having accepted any Shares for payment, unless such
occurrence or circumstance shall have been caused by or resulted from the
failure of Parent or Sub to perform, in any material respect, any of their
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or the breach by Parent or
Sub of any of their representations or warranties contained in this Agreement;
provided, however, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if Parent is then in material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder;
or

 



 

(d) By the Company if, prior to the Acceptance Time, there has been a breach
by Parent or Sub of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement,
which breach or inaccuracy is reasonably expected to prevent Parent or Sub
from performing in all material respects its obligations and covenants
required to be performed by it under this Agreement (and such breach or
inaccuracy is not capable of being cured); provided, however, that the Company
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(d) if the Company is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

 



 

(e) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company Board
of Directors shall have (A) effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, (B)

pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act; or

 



 

(f) At any time prior to the Acceptance Time, by the Company, if the Company
has received a Superior Proposal, which, after giving effect to all of the
adjustments that may be committed to by Parent pursuant to Section 5.2, the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisors) continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, provided
the Company shall not have knowingly materially violated or breached any of
its obligations under Section 5.2 in connection with the making of such
Superior Proposal; or

 



 

(g) By Parent, if upon a vote at a duly held meeting to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, such approval is not obtained, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(g) if the
Shares owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries shall not have been voted in
favor of adopting this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

8.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) Any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1 hereof will be
effective immediately upon the delivery of a written notice of the terminating
party to the other party hereto and, if then due, payment of the Termination
Fee. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1
hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and be of no
further force or effect and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Sub or the Company (or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, agents or representatives), except as set forth in the
penultimate sentence of Section 6.4, SECTION 8 and SECTION 9, each of which
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any
party from liability for fraud or intentional breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (it being understood that the failure of Parent or Sub to accept for
payment and pay for the Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer promptly following the Expiration Date in the event that all Offer
Conditions have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived, as of the
Expiration Date shall be deemed an intentional breach by Parent and Sub
pursuant to this Agreement). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination
Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(b) If Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e),
the Company shall promptly pay Parent a termination fee (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") of $10,000,000, but in no event later than two (2) business days after
the date of receipt of Parents termination notice. If the Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), it shall, in connection with and as
a condition to such termination, pay Parent the Termination Fee. If Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) due to the failure to
satisfy the Minimum Condition or 8.1(c)(i) due to a material breach of Section
5.2, or if the Company terminates pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), and in each
case at or prior to the time of termination an Acquisition Proposal has been
made (and, with regard to any termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), such
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly made), then the Company shall pay
Parent the Termination Fee upon signing a definitive agreement for a
transaction relating to an Acquisition Proposal (or, if earlier, the
consummation of a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal),
provided such signing (or, if earlier, such consummation) occurs within nine
(9) months of the termination date. All amounts due hereunder shall be payable
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to such account as Parent may
designate in writing to the Company. If the Company fails to promptly make any
payment required under this Section 8.2(b) and Parent commences a suit to
collect such payment, the Company shall indemnify Parent for its fees and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with
such suit and shall pay interest on the amount of the payment at the prime
rate of Bank of America (or its successors or assigns) in effect on the date
the payment was payable pursuant to this Section 8.2(b). For purposes of this
Section 8.2(b) only, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 5.2(a) except that all references to "15%"
therein shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



 

8.3. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 8.2, all fees, costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether
or not the Merger is consummated.

 



      
 

 



 

8.4. _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and as otherwise provided in the
Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and
all respects, whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the
Company contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by
action taken by their respective Boards of Directors, but after the Tender
Completion Time, no amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger
Consideration and, after the approval of this Agreement by the stockholders,
no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such
stockholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

 



 

8.5. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, either party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the other party or any conditions to its own obligations, in
each case only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions are
intended for its benefit; provided _,_ that any such extension or waiver shall
be binding upon a party only if such extension or waiver is set forth in a
writing executed by such party.

9.3. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules, Annexes and
Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein) contains
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the Offer, the Merger
and related transactions, and supersedes all prior agreements, written or
oral, among the parties with respect thereto, other than (a) the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive and remain in full force and
effect and (b) the Tender and Voting Agreements with the Principal
Stockholders.

 



 

9.4. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions arising under or in
connection therewith shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 



 

9.5. _Binding Effect; No Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties, except that Sub may assign, at no additional cost or expense to
the Company, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other
party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i)
Parent, (ii) to Parent and one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii) to one or more direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiaries of Parent (each, an " _Assignee_ "). Any such Assignee may
thereafter assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other
party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or
more additional Assignees; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that in connection with
any assignment to an

 



       
 

 



 

Assignee, Parent and Sub (or the assignor) shall agree to remain liable for
the performance by Parent and Sub (and such assignor, if applicable) of their
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without
relieving any party hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any person other than Parent, Sub and the Company and their
respective successors and permitted assigns any right, benefit or remedy of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (i)
Section 6.8, which shall confer third-party beneficiary rights to the parties
identified therein, and (ii) the right of the Companys stockholders to
receive the Closing Amount at the Acceptance Time or the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time.

 



 

9.6. _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic mail.

 



 

9.7. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The
parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of
this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid
or unenforceable provision.

 



 

9.8. _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the other party
hereto or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the
state courts of the State of Delaware or, the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware, and each of the Company, Parent and Sub hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any action or proceeding for itself and in
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that
(i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



      
 

 



 

9.9. _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any state court of the State of Delaware or the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

pursuant to unfulfilled guaranteed delivery procedures), and not validly
withdrawn does not equal at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding on
a fully diluted basis on the date of purchase (the " _Minimum Condition_ ");
(ii) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended in
accordance with the Merger Agreement) any waiting period (and any extensions
thereof) and any approvals or clearances applicable to the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act and any provisions under
applicable comparable Laws of foreign jurisdictions shall not have expired, or
been terminated or obtained, as applicable; or (iii) any of the following
events shall occur and be continuing:

or Subs ownership or operation (or that of any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates) of all or any material portion of their or the
Companys or the Company Subsidiaries businesses or assets, taken as a whole,
or to compel Parent or Sub or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to
dispose of or hold separate any material portion of the business or assets of
the Company or Parent or their respective subsidiaries, (ii) seeking to
prohibit or make illegal the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger
or the performance of any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger

(c) (1) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the
Merger Agreement, other than those in Section 3.2, Section 3.3(a), (b) and
(c), the first sentence of Section 3.8, Section 3.11(b) and Section 3.19,
shall not be true and correct, without giving effect to the words "materially"
or "material" or to any qualification based on the defined term "Company
Material Adverse Effect," except where the failure to be so true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, does not have or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (2) the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3.2, clause (i) of Section
3.19 and Section 3.20 shall not be true and correct in all material respects;
(3) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section
3.3(a), (b) and (c) shall not be true and correct; provided, however, that any
deviation therein of not more than 25,000 Shares in the aggregate shall not be
deemed to make such representations and warranties untrue or incorrect, (4)
the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Sections
3.11(b) and 3.19 (except for clause (i)) shall not be true and correct except
where the failure to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate,
does not have or would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the assets, properties, business, capitalization, results of
operations, or financial condition of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (5) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
the first sentence of Section 3.8 shall not be true and correct; provided that

or

 



 

(g) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub, may be
asserted by Parent or Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such
condition, and may be waived by Parent or Sub in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Sub, subject in
each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The failure by Parent or Sub
at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right and, each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

 



 

Annex I - 2     
 

 



 

The term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to
which this _Annex I_ is annexed. The other capitalized terms used in this

 **Annex II**

 



 

 ** _TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT_**

 



 

 **THIS TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT** (this " _Agreement_ ") dated [
], 2011, is entered into between Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), FRD Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_
"), and , (" _Stockholder_
"), with respect to (i) the shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share (the " _Share_ s"), of Adolor Corporation a Delaware corporation (the "

split-up or combination of the securities of the Company or upon any other
change in the Companys capital structure, in each case whether now owned or
hereafter acquired by the Stockholder (collectively, the " _Securities_ ").

 



 

 ** _W I T N E S S E T H:_**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Parent, Sub and the Company have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ ")
pursuant to which Sub has agreed to make a tender offer described therein and
thereafter merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") with the result
that the Company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as of the date hereof, Stockholder beneficially owns and has
the power to dispose of the Securities set forth on _Schedule I_ hereto and
has the power to vote the Shares set forth thereon;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Parent and Sub desire to enter into this Agreement in
connection with their efforts to consummate the acquisition of the Company;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined have
the meaning given to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in contemplation of the foregoing and in consideration
of the mutual agreements, covenants, representations and warranties contained
herein and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

 



 

1. _Certain Covenants_.

 



 

1.1 _Lock-Up_. Subject to Section 1.5, except as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that between the date
hereof and the Termination Date, Stockholder will not (a) directly or
indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, tender, encumber or
otherwise dispose of or limit its right to vote in any manner any of the
Securities, or agree to do any of the foregoing, or (b) take any action which
would have the effect of preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing
its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
connection with any transfer not involving or

 



 

Annex II - 1     
 

 



 

relating to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement),
Stockholder may transfer any or all of the Securities as follows: (i) in the
case of a Stockholder that is an entity, to any subsidiary, partner or member
of Stockholder, and (ii) in the case of an individual Stockholder, to
Stockholders spouse, ancestors, descendants, estate or any trust for any of
their benefits or to a charitable trust; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any
such case, prior to and as a condition to the effectiveness of such transfer,
(x) each person to which any of such Securities or any interest in any of such
Securities is or may be transferred (a) shall have executed and delivered to
Parent and Sub a counterpart to this Agreement pursuant to which such person
shall be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and (b)
shall have agreed in writing with Parent and Sub to hold such Securities or
interest in such Securities subject to all of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, and (y) this Agreement shall be the legal, valid and binding
agreement of such person, enforceable against such person in accordance with
its terms.

 



 

1.2 _No Solicitation_. Between the date hereof and the Termination Date,
except as permitted by Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder
shall not and shall not authorize any agent, representative, affiliate,
advisor, attorney, accountant or associate of Stockholder (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, take any action that the
Company is prohibited from taking under Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

1.3 _Certain Events_. This Agreement and the obligations hereunder will attach
to the Securities and will be binding upon any person to which legal or
beneficial ownership of any or all of the Securities passes, whether by
operation of Law or otherwise, including without limitation, the Stockholders
successors or assigns. This Agreement and the obligations hereunder will also
attach to any additional Shares or other Securities of the Company issued to
or acquired by the Stockholder.

 



 

1.4 _Grant of Proxy; Voting Agreement_.

 



 

(a) The Stockholder has revoked or terminated any proxies, voting agreements
or similar arrangements previously given or entered into with respect to the
Securities and hereby irrevocably appoints Parent as proxy for Stockholder to
vote the Securities for Stockholder and in Stockholders name, place and
stead, at any annual or special meeting, or at any adjournment thereof or
pursuant to any consent of the stockholders of the Company, in lieu of a
meeting or otherwise, whether before or after the Acceptance Time (as defined
in the Merger Agreement), for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Parent
acknowledges that the proxy granted hereby shall not be effective for any
other purpose other than that specified in the previous sentence. The parties
acknowledge and agree that neither Parent, nor Parents successors, assigns,
subsidiaries, divisions, employees, officers, directors, stockholders, agents
and affiliates shall owe any duty to, whether in law or otherwise, or incur
any liability of any kind whatsoever, including without limitation, with
respect to any and all claims, losses, demands, causes of action, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) and compensation of any kind
or nature whatsoever to the Stockholder in connection with or as a result of
any voting by Parent of the Securities or any execution of any consent. The
parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the authority hereby granted under the
irrevocable proxy, Parent may vote the Securities in furtherance of its own
interests, and Parent is not acting as a fiduciary for the Stockholder.

 



 

Annex II - 2      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing grant to Parent of the irrevocable proxy, if
Parent elects not to exercise its rights to vote the Securities pursuant to
the irrevocable proxy, Stockholder agrees to vote the Securities during the
term of this Agreement in favor of or give its consent to, as applicable, a
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement as described in Section 1.4 at any
annual or special meeting or action of the stockholders of the Company in lieu
of a meeting or otherwise.

 



 

(c) This irrevocable proxy shall not be terminated by any act of the
Stockholder or by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of the
Stockholder or by the occurrence of any other event or events (including,
without limiting the foregoing, the termination of any trust or estate for
which Stockholder is acting as a fiduciary or fiduciaries or the dissolution
or liquidation of any corporation or partnership). If between the execution
hereof and the Termination Date, Stockholder should die or become
incapacitated, or if any trust or estate holding the Securities should be
terminated, or if any corporation or partnership holding the Securities should
be dissolved or liquidated, or if any other such similar event or events shall
occur before the Termination Date, certificates representing the Securities
shall be delivered by or on behalf of Stockholder in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, and actions taken
by Parent hereunder shall be as valid as if such death, incapacity,
termination, dissolution, liquidation or other similar event or events had not
occurred, regardless of whether or not Parent has received notice of such
death, incapacity, termination, dissolution, liquidation or other event.

 



 

1.5 _Tender of Securities_. Stockholder agrees, in exchange for the
consideration described in the Merger Agreement, to tender the Shares
beneficially owned as of the date hereof and set forth on Schedule I hereto
for which Stockholder has sole dispositive power to Sub in the Offer as soon
as practicable following the commencement of the Offer, and in any event not
later than five (5) business days following the commencement of the Offer, and
Stockholder shall not withdraw any such Shares so tendered unless the Offer is
terminated; _provided_ , _however_ , that Stockholder shall have no duty or
obligation to tender any Shares into the Offer if such action would cause
Stockholder to incur liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

1.6 _Option_.

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Stockholder
hereby grants to Parent an irrevocable option (the " _Option_ ") to purchase
all of the right, title and interest of Stockholder in and to Stockholders
Securities with a price per share equal to the Offer Price; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Stockholder shall have no duty or obligation to sell any
Securities to Parent if such action would cause Stockholder to incur liability
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. Parent may exercise the Option in
whole, but not in part, if, but only if, (i) Sub has acquired Shares pursuant
to the Offer and (ii) Stockholder has failed to tender into the Offer any
Shares or shall have withdrawn the tender of any Shares into the Offer in
breach of this Agreement. Parent may exercise the Option at any time within
the sixty (60) days following the date when such Option first becomes
exercisable.

 



 

(b) In the event that Parent is entitled to and wishes to exercise the Option,
Parent shall send a written notice to Stockholder specifying the place and the
date for the

 



 

Annex II - 3     
 

 



 

closing of such purchase, which date shall be not more than sixty (60) days
after the date of such notice; provided that in the event that prior
notification to, or approval of, any Governmental Entity is required in
connection with the exercise of the Option or there shall be in effect any
preliminary or final injunction or other order issued by any Governmental
Entity prohibiting the exercise of the Option, the period of time during which
the date of the closing may be fixed shall be extended until the tenth (10th)
day following the last date on which all required approvals shall have been
obtained, all required waiting periods shall have expired or been terminated
and any such prohibition shall have been vacated, terminated or waived.

 



 

(c) At the closing of the purchase of Stockholders Securities pursuant to
exercise of the Option, simultaneously with the payment by Parent of the
purchase price for Stockholders Securities, such Stockholder shall deliver,
or cause to be delivered, to the Sub certificates representing Securities duly
endorsed to Parent or accompanied by stock powers or other transfer documents
duly executed by the Company in blank, together with any necessary stock
transfer stamps properly affixed, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

 



 

1.7 _Public Announcement_. Stockholder shall consult with Parent before
issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the approval of
Parent, except as may be required by Law, including any filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "). This Section 1.7
shall terminate and be null and void upon the earlier of (i) the Termination
Date and (ii) consummation of the Merger.

 



 

1.8 _Disclosure_. Stockholder hereby authorizes Parent and Sub to publish and
disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by the SEC, The Nasdaq
Stock Market or any other national securities exchange and in the Offer
Documents and, if necessary, the Proxy Statement (each as defined in the
Merger Agreement), (including all documents and schedules filed with the SEC
in connection with either of the foregoing), its identity and ownership of the
Securities and the nature of its commitments, arrangements and understandings
under this Agreement. Parent and Sub hereby authorize Stockholder to make such
disclosure or filings as may be required by the SEC or The Nasdaq Stock Market
or any other national securities exchange.

 



 

2. _Representations and Warranties of Stockholder_. Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Sub, as of the date hereof and as of the date Sub purchases Shares pursuant to the Offer, that:

 



 

2.1 _Ownership_. Stockholder has good and marketable title to, and is the sole
legal and beneficial owner of the Securities set forth on Schedule I hereto,
in each case free and clear of all liabilities, claims, liens, options,
proxies, charges, participations and encumbrances of any kind or character
whatsoever, other than those arising under the securities laws or under the
Companys governance documents or under any registration rights agreement
between the Company and Stockholder (collectively, " _Liens_ "). At the time
Sub purchases the Shares pursuant to the Offer, Stockholder will transfer and
convey to Parent or its designee good and

 



 

Annex II - 4     
 

 



 

marketable title to the Shares included in the Securities, free and clear of
all Liens created by or arising through Stockholder.

 



 

2.2 _Authorization_. Stockholder has all requisite power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and has sole voting power and sole power of disposition,
with respect to the Securities with no restrictions on its voting rights or
rights of disposition pertaining thereto except pursuant to applicable
community property laws. Stockholder has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding agreement of
Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with its terms. If
the Stockholder is married and the Securities constitute community property,
this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Stockholders spouse, and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of the Stockholders spouse, enforceable against the Stockholders
spouse in accordance with its terms.

 



 

2.3 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) require the
Stockholder to file or register with, or obtain any permit, authorization,
consent or approval of, any governmental agency, authority, administrative or
regulatory body, court or other tribunal, foreign or domestic, or any other
entity other than filings with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, or (b)
violate, or cause a breach of or default under, or conflict with any contract,
agreement or understanding, any Law binding upon the Stockholder, except for
such violations, breaches, defaults or conflicts which are not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
the Stockholders ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement. No
proceedings are pending which, if adversely determined, will have an adverse
effect on any ability to vote or dispose of any of the Securities. The
Stockholder has not previously assigned or sold any of the Securities to any
third party.

 



 

2.4 _Stockholder Has Adequate Information_. Stockholder is a sophisticated
seller with respect to the Securities and has adequate information concerning
the business and financial condition of the Company to make an informed
decision regarding the sale of the Securities and has independently and
without reliance upon either Sub or Parent and based on such information as
Stockholder has deemed appropriate, made its own analysis and decision to
enter into this Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges that neither Sub nor
Parent has made and neither makes any representation or warranty, whether
express or implied, of any kind or character except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges that the agreements contained herein
with respect to the Securities by Stockholder are irrevocable (prior to the
Termination Date), and that Stockholder shall have no recourse to the
Securities, Parent or Sub, except with respect to breaches of representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

2.5 _No Setoff_. The Stockholder has no liability or obligation related to or
in connection with the Securities other than the obligations to Parent and Sub
as set forth in this Agreement. There are no legal or equitable defenses or
counterclaims that have been or may be asserted by or on behalf of the Company
or the Stockholder to reduce the amount of the Securities or affect the
validity or enforceability of the Securities.

 



 

Annex II - 5     
 

 



 

3. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub_. Parent and Sub hereby represent and warrant to Stockholder, as of the date hereof that:

 



 

3.1 _Authorization_. Parent and Sub have all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Sub have duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of each of Parent and Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and
Sub in accordance with its terms.

 



 

3.2 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will violate, or
cause a breach of or default under, any contract or agreement, any statute or
law, or any judgment, decree, order, regulation or rule of any governmental
agency, authority, administrative or regulatory body, court or other tribunal,
foreign or domestic, or any other entity or any arbitration award binding upon
Parent or Sub, except for such violations, breaches or defaults which are not
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on either Parents or
Subs ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

4. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The respective representations and warranties of Stockholder, Parent and Sub contained herein shall not be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made by the other party hereto. The representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, including extensions thereof.

 



 

5. _Specific Performance_. Stockholder acknowledges that Sub and Parent will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of Stockholder which are contained in this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to Sub and Parent upon the breach by Stockholder of such covenants and agreements, Sub and Parent shall have the right to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of such covenants or agreements or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of such covenants or agreements.

 



 

6. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

6.1 _Term_. This Agreement and all obligations hereunder shall terminate upon
the earlier of (i) the day after the Merger is consummated, (ii) the Outside
Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (iii) the date of any modification
or amendment to the Merger Agreement or waiver of a Company right under the
Merger Agreement, and (iv) the termination of the Merger Agreement (the
earliest of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the " _Termination Date_ ").

 



 

6.2 _Fiduciary Duties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary: (a) the Stockholder makes no agreement or understanding herein in
any capacity other than in the Stockholders capacity as a record holder and
beneficial owner of Securities and not in such Stockholders capacity as a
director, officer or employee, or as a trustee or fiduciary for any employee
benefit plan or trust, and (b) nothing herein will be construed to limit or
affect any action or inaction by the Stockholder or any Representative of the
Stockholder, as applicable,

 



 

Annex II - 6     
 

 



 

serving on the Company Board of Directors or on the board of directors of any

benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
representatives and permitted successors and assigns.

the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the
parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may be amended only

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No party may assign either this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without
the prior written approval of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each of Parent and Sub may freely assign its rights to another direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Sub without such prior written
approval but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment requiring consent without such
consent shall be void.

 



 

6.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but each of which together
shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

 



 

6.9 _Notices_. Any notice or other communication required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered in
person, by overnight courier, by facsimile transmission (with receipt
confirmed by telephone or by automatic transmission report) or by electronic

holders with respect to transfers of CPRs unless and until such CPRs are
transferred into the name of such street name holders in accordance with
Section 2.2 of this Agreement. With respect to any payments to be made under
Section 2.4 below, the Rights Agent will accomplish the payment to any former
street name holders of shares of Company Common Stock by sending one lump
payment to DTC. The Rights Agent will have no responsibilities whatsoever with
regard to the distribution of payments by DTC to such street name holders.

 



 

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in Section 2.2,
every request made to transfer a CPR must be in writing and accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Rights
Agent pursuant to its guidelines, duly executed by the Holder thereof, the
Holders attorney duly authorized in writing, the Holders personal
representative or the Holders survivor, and setting forth in reasonable
detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such
written notice, the Rights Agent will, subject to its reasonable determination
that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise
complies with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
provisions of Section 2.2), register the transfer of the CPRs in the CPR
Register. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer of
a CPR, but Parent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp
or other tax or governmental charge that is imposed in connection with any
such registration of transfer. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or
obligation to take any action under any section of this Agreement that
requires the payment by a Holder of a CPR of applicable taxes or charges
unless and until the Rights Agent is satisfied that all such taxes or charges
have been paid. All duly transferred CPRs registered in the CPR Register will
be the valid obligations of Parent and will entitle the transferee to the same
benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held immediately prior to
the transfer by the transferor. No transfer of a CPR will be valid until
registered in the CPR Register.

 



 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CPR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent will promptly record the change of address in the CPR Register.

 



 

2.4. _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(a) On or before the fifth Business Day following (i) any EMA Payment Trigger
Date and (ii) July 1, 2019, Parent will deliver to the Rights Agent a notice
(the " _EMA_

 



 

Annex IV - 8     
 

 



 

 _Approval Payment Notice_ ") indicating whether EMA Approval was achieved,
and if achieved, whether EMA Preferred Product Label Approval was achieved. On
or before the fifth Business Day following (i) any FDA Payment Trigger Date
and (ii) July 1, 2019, Parent will deliver to the Rights Agent a notice (the "
_FDA Approval Payment Notice_ ") indicating whether FDA Product Approval was
achieved, and if achieved, whether FDA Preferred Product Label Approval was
achieved. On or before the fifth Business Day following (i) any Sales
Milestone Trigger Date and (ii) July 1, 2024, unless prior to such date one or
more Regulatory Approval Payment Notices was delivered to the Rights Agent
indicating both FDA Preferred Product Label Approval and EMA Preferred Product
Label Approval had been achieved, Parent will deliver to the Rights Agent a
notice (the " _Milestone Notice_ ") indicating whether a Sales Milestone was
achieved.

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent will, within ten Business Days of receipt of any
Regulatory Approval Payment Notice (each such date, a " _Regulatory Approval
Payment Date_ "), send each Holder at its registered address a copy of the
Regulatory Approval Payment Notice. If a Regulatory Approval Payment Amount is
payable to the Holders, then at the time the Rights Agent sends a copy of a
Regulatory Approval Payment Notice to the Holders, the Rights Agent will also
pay the applicable Regulatory Approval Payment Amount to each of the Holders
(the amount to which each Holder is entitled to receive will be the applicable
Regulatory Approval Payment Amount multiplied by the number of CPRs held by
such Holder as reflected on the CPR Register) by check mailed to the address
of each Holder as reflected in the CPR Register as of the close of business on
the last Business Day prior to such Regulatory Approval Payment Date.

 



 

(c) The Rights Agent will, within ten Business Days of receipt of any
Milestone Notice, send each Holder at its registered address a copy of the
Milestone Notice. If a Milestone Payment Amount is payable to the Holders,
then at the time the Rights Agent sends a copy of a Milestone Notice to the
Holders, the Rights Agent will also pay the applicable Milestone Payment
Amount to each of the Holders (the amount to which each Holder is entitled to
receive will be the applicable Milestone Payment Amount multiplied by the
number of CPRs held by such Holder as reflected on the CPR Register) by check
mailed to the address of each Holder as reflected in the CPR Register as of
the close of business on the last Business Day prior to such Milestone Payment
Date.

 



 

(d) Parent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold, or cause the Rights Agent
to deduct or withhold, from any Payment Amount otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder, or any other
applicable Tax Law, as may be determined by Parent or the Rights Agent. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid, and as soon as practicable
after any payment of such taxes by Parent or the Rights Agent, Parent shall
deliver (or shall cause the Rights Agent to deliver) to the person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid the original or a certified copy
of a receipt issued by the applicable taxing authority evidencing such
payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment, or other reasonably
acceptable evidence of such payment.

 



 

Annex IV - 9      
 

 



 

(e) Any portion of any Payment Amount that remains undistributed to the
Holders six months after an applicable Payment Date will be delivered by the
Rights Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any Holder will thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of such Payment Amount, without interest, but such
Holder will have no greater rights against Parent than those accorded to
general unsecured creditors of Parent under applicable law.

 



 

(f) Neither Parent nor the Rights Agent will be liable to any person in
respect of any Payment Amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Payment Amount
has not been paid immediately prior to the date on which such Payment Amount
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such Payment Amount will, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

2.5. _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest in
Parent_.

 



 

(a) The CPRs will not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest will
not accrue on any amounts payable on the CPRs to any Holder.

 



 

(b) The CPRs will not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent or
in any constituent company to the Merger.

 



 

3. THE RIGHTS AGENT

 



 

3.1. _Certain Duties and Responsibilities_. The Rights Agent will not have any
liability for any actions taken or not taken in connection with this
Agreement, except to the extent of its willful misconduct, bad faith or gross
negligence.

 



 

3.2. _Certain Rights of Rights Agent_. The Rights Agent undertakes to perform
such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations will be read into this
Agreement against the Rights Agent. In addition:

 



 

(a) the Rights Agent may rely and will be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, direction, consent, order or other paper or document
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper party or parties;

 



 

(b) whenever the Rights Agent will deem it desirable that a matter be proved
or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder,
the Rights Agent may, in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct on its part, rely upon an Officers Certificate;

 



 

(c) the Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection and
the written advice of such counsel or any opinion of counsel will be full and
complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered
or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

 



 

Annex IV - 10     
 

 



 

(d) the permissive rights of the Rights Agent to do things enumerated in this
Agreement will not be construed as a duty;

 



 

(e) the Rights Agent will not be required to give any note or surety in
respect of the execution of such powers or otherwise in respect of the
premises;

 



 

(f) Parent agrees to indemnify Rights Agent for, and hold Rights Agent
harmless against, any loss, liability, claim, demands, suits or expense
arising out of or in connection with Rights Agents duties under this
Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending Rights Agent against
any claims, charges, demands, suits or loss, unless such loss has been
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be a result of Rights
Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful or intentional misconduct; and

 



 

(g) Parent agrees (i) to pay the fees and expenses of the Rights Agent in
connection with this Agreement as agreed upon in writing by Rights Agent and
Parent on or prior to the date hereof, and (ii) to reimburse the Rights Agent
for all taxes and governmental charges, reasonable expenses and other charges
of any kind and nature incurred by the Rights Agent in the execution of this
Agreement (other than taxes imposed on or measured by the Rights Agents net
income and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income
taxes)). The Rights Agent will also be entitled to reimbursement from Parent
for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by it
in connection with the administration by the Rights Agent of its duties
hereunder.

 



 

3.3. _Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor_.

 



 

(a) The Rights Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
to Parent specifying a date when such resignation will take effect, which
notice will be sent at least 60 days prior to the date so specified but in no
event will such resignation become effective until a successor Rights Agent
has been appointed. Parent has the right to remove Rights Agent at any time by
a Board Resolution specifying a date when such removal will take effect but no
such removal will become effective until a successor Rights Agent has been
appointed. Notice of such removal will be given by Parent to Rights Agent,
which notice will be sent at least 60 days prior to the date so specified.

 



 

(b) If the Rights Agent provides notice of its intent to resign, is removed or
becomes incapable of acting, Parent, by a Board Resolution, will as soon as is
reasonably possible appoint a qualified successor Rights Agent who may be a
Holder but may not be an officer of Parent. The successor Rights Agent so
appointed will, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in
accordance with Section 3.4, become the successor Rights Agent.

 



 

(c) Parent will give notice of each resignation and each removal of a Rights
Agent and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent by mailing written
notice of such event by first-class mail to the Holders as their names and
addresses appear in the CPR Register. Each notice will include the name and
address of the successor Rights Agent. If Parent fails to send such notice
within ten days after acceptance of appointment by a

 



 

Annex IV - 11     
 

 



 

successor Rights Agent, the successor Rights Agent will cause the notice to be
mailed at the expense of Parent.

 



 

3.4. _Acceptance of Appointment by Successor_. Every successor Rights Agent
appointed hereunder will execute, acknowledge and deliver to Parent and to the
retiring Rights Agent an instrument accepting such appointment and a
counterpart of this Agreement, and thereupon such successor Rights Agent,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, will become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent. On request of
Parent or the successor Rights Agent, the retiring Rights Agent will execute
and deliver an instrument transferring to the successor Rights Agent all the
rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Rights Agent.

 



 

4. COVENANTS

 



 

4.1. _List of Holders_. Parent will furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Rights Agent in such form as Parent receives from the Companys transfer agent
(or other agent performing similar services for the Company), the names and
addresses of the Holders within ten Business Days of the Effective Time.

 



 

4.2. _Payment of Payment Amounts_. Parent will promptly deposit with the
Rights Agent, for payment to each Holder, the applicable Payment Amount, if
any, prior to an applicable Payment Date if such amount is payable in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

4.3. _Milestones_. Parent shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to,
use Diligent Efforts to achieve each of the Milestones.

 



 

4.4. _Books and Records_. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
keep true, complete and accurate records in sufficient detail to enable the
Holders and their consultants or professional advisors to determine the
amounts payable hereunder.

 



 

4.5. Audits.

 



 

(a) Upon the written request of the Acting Holders within one (1) year of the
delivery of any Milestone Notice (the " _Review Request Period_ ") but no more
than once per Milestone Notice, Parent shall permit, and shall cause its
controlled Affiliates to permit, the Independent Accountant to have access
during normal business hours to such of the records of the Company as may be
reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the Net Sales Statement and the
figures underlying the calculations set forth therein, including, without
limitation, all written materials related to any sale transaction reasonably
requested by such Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall be
charged to come to a final determination with respect to those specific items
in the Net Sales Statement that the parties disagree on and submit to it for
resolution. All other items in the Net Sales Statement that the parties do not
submit, prior to the end of the Review Request Period, to the Independent
Accountant for resolution shall be deemed to be agreed by the parties and the
Independent Accountant shall not be charged with calculating or validating
those agreed upon items. If issues are submitted to the Independent Accountant
for resolution, Parent shall, and shall cause to its controlled

 



 

Annex IV - 12     
 

 



 

Affiliates to, furnish to the Independent Accountant such access, work papers
and other documents and information related to those disputed issues as the
Independent Accountant may request and as are available to Parent. The
Independent Accountant shall disclose to Parent and the Acting Holders any
matters directly related to their findings to the extent necessary to verify
the accuracy or completeness of the Net Sales Statements. The fees charged by
such accounting firm shall be paid Parent.

 



 

(b) If the Independent Accountant concludes that either the Four Hundred
Million Dollar Sales Target or the Eight Hundred Million Dollar Sales Target
was achieved and a Milestone Payment Amount that was properly due was not paid
to the Holders (the difference in payment being the "CPR Shortfall"), Parent
shall pay the CPR Shortfall with respect to each CPR within ten (10) days of
the date the Acting Holders deliver to Parent the Independent Accountants
written report. The decision of the Independent Accountant shall be final,
conclusive and binding on Parent and the Holders, shall be non-appealable and
shall not be subject to further review.

 



 

(c) If, upon the expiration of the Review Request Period, the Acting Holders
have not requested a review of the Net Sales Statement in accordance with this
Section 4.8, the calculations set forth in the Net Sales Statement shall be
binding and conclusive upon the Holders.

 



 

(d) Each person seeking to receive information from Parent in connection with
a review pursuant to this Section 4.8 shall enter into, and shall cause its
accounting firm to enter into, a reasonable and mutually satisfactory
confidentiality agreement with Parent or any controlled Affiliate obligating
such party to retain all such information disclosed to such party in
confidence pursuant to such confidentiality agreement.

of the Holder of each outstanding CPR affected thereby.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the execution by Parent and the Rights Agent of any
amendment pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.2, Parent will mail (or

Agreement. The Rights Agent may, but is not obligated to, enter into any such
amendment that affects the Rights Agents own rights, privileges, covenants or
duties under this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

5.4. _Effect of Amendments_. Upon the execution of any amendment under this
Section 5, this Agreement will be modified in accordance therewith, such
amendment will form a part of this Agreement for all purposes and every Holder
will be bound thereby.

The Rights Agent or Parent may specify a different address or facsimile number
by giving notice in accordance with this Section 6.1.

 



 

6.2. _Notice to Holders_. Where this Agreement provides for notice to Holders,
such notice will be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly
provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each
Holder affected by such event, at the Holders address as it appears in the
CPR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, if any, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case
where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such
notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder will
affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.

 



 

6.3. _Parent Successors and Assigns_. Parent may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent or to any purchaser or licensee of
substantial rights to the Product (each, an " _Assignee_ "). Any such Assignee
may thereafter assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any
other party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to
one or more additional Assignees; provided, however, that in connection with
any assignment to an Assignee, Parent and Sub (or the other assignor) shall
agree to remain liable for the performance by Parent and Sub (and such other
assignor, if applicable) of their obligations hereunder. This Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Parents
successors and each Assignee, and this Agreement shall not restrict Parents,
any Assignees or any of their respective successors ability to merge or
consolidate. Each of Parents successors shall expressly assume by an
instrument supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Rights Agent,
the due and punctual payment of the CPRs and the due and punctual performance
and observance of all of the covenants and obligations of this Agreement to be
performed or observed by Parent.

 



 

6.4. _Benefits of Agreement_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
will give to any Person (other than the Rights Agent, Parent, Parents
successors and assignees, and the Holders) any benefit or any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement or under any covenant or
provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the
sole benefit of the, Rights Agent, Parent, Parents successors and assignees,
and the Holders. The rights of Holders are limited to those expressly provided
in this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

 



 

6.5. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the CPRs and all actions arising under
or in connection therewith shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the laws of the respective jurisdictions of
incorporation of each of the parties shall govern the relative rights,
obligations, powers, duties and other internal affairs of such party and its
board of directors.

 



 

6.6. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force

 



 

Annex IV - 16     
 

 



 

and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only
in part or degree shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held
invalid or unenforceable. The parties further agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision.

 



 

6.7. _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other party, it being understood that the parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 



 

6.8. _Termination_. This Agreement will be terminated and of no force or
effect, the parties hereto will have no liability hereunder, and no payments
will be required to be made, upon the earlier to occur of (a) the mailing by
the Rights Agent to the address of each Holder as reflected in the CPR
Register the full amount of all potential Payment Amounts required to be paid
under the terms of this Agreement and (b) the expiration of the final Review
Request Period, unless there is an ongoing audit pursuant to Section 4.8, in
which case until such audit has been completed. In no event will any
Regulatory Approval Payment Amount become payable after the Regulatory
Approval Payment Target Date, nor will any Milestone Payment Amount become
payable on account of sales of the Product consummated after June 30, 2024.

 



 

6.9. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Merger Agreement (including
the schedules, annexes and exhibits thereto and the documents and instruments
referred to therein) contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto
and thereto with reference to the transactions and matters contemplated hereby
and thereby and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the
parties with respect hereto and thereto. If and to the extent that any
provision of this Agreement is inconsistent or conflicts with the Merger
Agreement, this Agreement will govern and be controlling.

 



 

6.10. _Dispute Resolution_. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this
contract, including the breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be
finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the International Institute
for Conflict Prevention and Resolution Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration
by three arbitrators, of whom each party shall designate one in accordance
with the screened appointment procedure provided in Rule 5.4. The
arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et
seq., and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered
by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of the arbitration shall
be New York, New York. In any such dispute, actions on behalf of Holders,
including initiation of arbitration, shall be approved by the Acting Holders.
