for Purchaser to transition such employees into Purchaser\'s records.   (b)

and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge
and deliver all such further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases
and acquaintances and such other instruments, and shall take such further
actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to assure fully to
Purchaser and its respective successors or assigns, all of the properties,
rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended
to be conveyed to Purchaser under this Agreement and the Sellers Documents
and to assure fully to Sellers and its Affiliates and their successors and
assigns, the assumption of the liabilities and obligations intended to be
assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement and the Sellers Documents, and to
otherwise make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.   (c) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or
agreement to assign any Purchased Asset, including any Contract, Permit,
certificate, approval, authorization or other right, which by its terms or by
Law is nonassignable without the consent of a third party or a Governmental

("Nonassignable Assets") unless and until such consent shall have been
obtained. With respect to Material Contracts or Permits that are material for
the Business as a going concern after the Closing Date, Sellers shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Purchaser at its request for up to 180 days following the
Closing Date in endeavoring to obtain such consents promptly;    
18   provided, however, that such efforts shall not require any Seller or
any of their Affiliates to incur any expenses or Liabilities or provide any
financial accommodation or to remain secondarily or contingently liable for
any Assumed Liability or to initiate any litigation or legal proceedings to
obtain any such consent. If any such consent is not obtained, or if any
attempt at an assignment thereof would be ineffective or would affect the
rights of Sellers thereunder so that Purchaser would not in fact receive all
such rights, Sellers shall cooperate, at no expense to Sellers, with
Purchaser to provide Purchaser with the economic benefits under such
Purchased Asset, Contract, Permit, certificate, approval, authorization or
other right. including, without limitation, the Purchased Contracts set forth
on Schedule 2.5(c), provided that no Seller shall be obligated to continue as
a going concern. Purchaser and Sellers, at no additional expense to
Purchaser, shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, or cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval or
amendment required to novate all Liabilities under any and all Purchased
Contracts or other Liabilities that constitute Assumed Liabilities or to
obtain in writing the unconditional release of Sellers and their Affiliates
so that, in any such case, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for such
Liabilities.   2.6 Bulk Sales Laws. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by
Sellers with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk-transfer" Laws of
any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of
any or all of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser.   2.7 Purchase Price
Allocation.   (a) Purchaser and Sellers agree that, for Purchaser\'s and
Sellers\' respective federal, state and local income tax purposes, the
Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities (the "Asset Basis") shall be
allocated among the Purchased Assets and Sellers\' Non-Competition Agreement
as set forth in Allocation Schedule (as provided below) and in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.  
(b) Within a reasonable period of time following the Closing, but in no event
later than forty five (45) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Sellers a schedule (an "Allocation
Schedule") allocating the Asset Basis among the Purchased Assets and the
Sellers\' Non-Competition Agreement.   (i) Sellers shall have a period of
ten (10) days after the delivery of  the Allocation Schedule (the "Allocation
Response Period") to present in  writing to Purchaser notice of any
objections Sellers may have to the  allocations set forth therein (an
"Allocation Objections Notice"). Unless  Sellers timely object, or as
otherwise require by law, such Allocation  Schedule shall be binding on the
parties without further adjustment.   (ii) If Sellers shall raise any
objections within the Allocation  Response Period, Purchaser and Sellers
shall negotiate in good faith and  use their commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such dispute. If the  parties fail to     19    agree
within five (5) days after the delivery of the Allocation Objections  Notice,
then Purchaser shall submit the Allocation Schedule, including 
modifications, if any, that Purchaser chooses to make as a result of its 
negotiations with Sellers, to Deloitte and Touche or such other independent 
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Purchaser (the 
"Accounting Referee") for resolution by it. The disputed items shall be 
submitted to the Accounting Referee within five (5) days following such 
failure to agree. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be  final
and binding on the parties and shall not be subject to appeal. The 
Accounting Referee shall render such decision and report to Seller and 
Purchaser in writing, specifying the reasons for its decision in reasonable 
detail, not later than thirty (30) days after the item has been referred to 
it. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne 
equally by Sellers (collectively) and Purchaser.   (iii) For all Tax
purposes, Purchaser and Sellers agree to report the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the  terms of this
Agreement and the Allocation Schedule as finally determined,  and agree that,
except as otherwise required by law, neither of them will  take any position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return. In addition, to  the extent there
are accounts receivable credit balances and deferred  revenue on the balance
sheet of Sellers as at the Closing Date, Sellers  will recognize the value of
such accounts as ordinary income on their Tax  Returns as appropriate or
required by law.   ARTICLE III   CONSIDERATION   3.1 Consideration. The
aggregate consideration for the Purchased Assets shall be (a) an amount in
cash equal to Two Hundred Six Million Dollars ($206,000,000) (the "Purchase

11.2, and (b) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.   3.2 Purchase

immediately deposit with the Escrow Agent under the Purchase Price

Escrowed Fund shall be applied towards the Purchase Price payable by
Purchaser to Sellers pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof;   (b) if this
Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to Section 4.4(f), the Purchase
Price Deposit Escrowed Fund shall be delivered to Sellers; or     20

Purchaser.   3.3 Payment of Purchase Price; Funding of Certain Escrows; Non-

Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent under the General Escrow

least 10 days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser
an estimate of the Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working
Capital"), which shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.   (b) As
promptly as practicable, but no later than forty-five (45) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Sellers
the Closing Statement (as defined below) and a certificate based on
such Closing Statement setting forth Purchaser\'s calculation of Closing
Working Capital. The closing statement (the "Closing Statement") shall fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated Net Working Capital of the
Business as of the end of business on the Closing Date ("Closing Working
Capital"). "Net Working Capital" means (i) the sum of (A) trade and    
21   other accounts receivable net of reserves, (B) Inventory, (C)
Sellers\' prepaid expenses and other current assets (excluding Taxes related
accounts, sales and use Tax, property Tax, deferred income Tax and other Tax

established under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 for derivative instruments and hedging activities), and (D)
notes and lease receivables, reduced by, without duplication, (ii) the sum of
(A) trade and other accounts payable of Sellers (including any customer
security or other deposits but excluding Taxes related accounts, sales and
use Tax, property Tax, deferred income Tax or other Tax on Products but
excluding any and all accounts representing derivative liabilities
established under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 for derivative instruments and hedging activities), (B)
accounts receivable credit balances of Sellers and (C) without duplication,
deferred revenue of Sellers, in each case as determined in accordance with
the accounting principles set forth on Schedule 3.4(b)(i) (the "Agreed
Principles"). The preparation of the Closing Statement shall be for the sole
purpose of determining the difference between the Net Working Capital on the
Closing Date and the Average Net Working Capital. For purposes
hereof, "Average Net Working Capital" shall mean the arithmetic average of
Net Working Capital as of the conclusion of each calendar month during the
12-month period ending on August 31, 2003 as set forth on Schedule
3.4(b)(ii).   (c) If Sellers disagree with Purchaser\'s calculation of
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(b), Sellers may,
within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a
notice to Purchaser disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth
Sellers\' calculation of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall
specify those items or amounts as to which Sellers disagree, and Sellers
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in
the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital
delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(b).   (d) If a notice of disagreement
shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(c), Purchaser and Sellers
shall, during the ten (10) days following such delivery, use their reasonable
best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital, which
amount shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in Purchaser\'s
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(b) nor more than the amount
thereof shown in Sellers\' calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(c).
If during such period, Purchaser and Sellers are unable to reach such
agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Accounting Referee
to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose
of calculating Closing Working Capital (it being understood that in making
such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall be functioning as an expert
and not as an arbitrator). In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee
shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and
Sellers\' calculation of Closing Working Capital as to which Sellers has
disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Purchaser and Sellers, as
promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than thirty (30) days from
the date of engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth
such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and
Sellers. The cost of such review and report shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and Sellers.   (e) Purchaser and Sellers shall, and shall cause
their respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation
of the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital and
in the conduct of the review referred to in     22   this Section 3.4,
including, without limitation, the making available to the extent necessary
of books, records, work papers and personnel.   (f) If the Final Working
Capital exceeds the Average Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay to
Sellers, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 3.4(g), the
amount of such excess and, if the Final Working Capital is less than the
Average Net Working Capital, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser, as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section
3.4(g), the amount of such deficiency. "Final Working Capital" means Closing
Working Capital (i) as shown in Purchaser\'s calculation delivered pursuant
to Section 3.4(b) if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly
delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(c); or (ii) if such a notice
of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed by Purchaser and Sellers pursuant
to Section 3.4(d) or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as shown in
the Accounting Referee\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section
3.4(d).   (g) Any payment pursuant to Section 3.4(f) shall be made at a
mutually convenient time and place within three (3) Business Days after Final
Working Capital has been determined by wire transfer by Purchaser or Sellers,
as the case may be, of immediately available funds to the account of such
other party as may be designated in writing by such other party. The amount
of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall bear interest
from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a
rate per annum equal to the rate of interest published from time to time by
the Wall Street Journal as the "prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks
during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest
shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and
shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty five
(365) days and the actual number of days elapsed.   3.5 Accounts Receivable
Credit Balance Adjustment.   (a) In the event that there is a Heating Degree
Day Deficit (as defined below) that is greater than 2.0% of the Average
Heating Degree Days (as defined below) for the period from September 15, 2003
through March 31, 2004, Purchaser shall be entitled to receive from the
Credit Balance Escrow Fund the amount of the Warm Weather Adjustment (but
shall not be entitled to receive the amount, if any, by which the Warm
Weather Adjustment exceeds the amount of the Credit Balance Escrow Fund). For
purposes hereof:   "Warm Weather Adjustment" = (Heating Degree Day Deficit *
Burn Rate * Budget Price * Number of Budget Program Customers at Closing) *
(number of days between April 1, 2003 and the Closing Date / 365)   As soon
as practicable after March 31, 2004, but no later than April 15, 2004,
Purchaser shall calculate the Warm Weather Adjustment, and deliver to Sellers
the Accounts Receivable Credit Balance Settlement Statement based thereon
(the "Credit Balances Settlement Statement") and a certificate based on such
Credit Balance Settlement     23   Statement setting forth Purchaser\'s
calculation of any disbursement of all or a portion of the Credit Balance
Escrow Fund to Purchaser (the "Cash Settlement of Credit Balances"). No
payment shall be made out of the Credit Balance Escrow Fund to Purchaser
unless there is a Heating Degree Day Deficit of greater than 2.0% of the
Average Heating Degree Days.   (b) For purposes of this Section 3.5 the
following terms shall have the following meanings:   (i) "Average Heating
Degree Days" means 6,084.   (ii) "Actual Heating Degree Days" means the
average of the cumulative  heating degree days recorded at each of Sellers\'
89 separate Heating Degree  Day monitors across its marketing territory from
September 15, 2003 through  March 31, 2004.   (iii) "Heating Degree Day
Deficit" means Average Heating Degree Days  minus Actual Heating Degree Days,
which in any event shall be no less than  zero.   (iv) "Burn Rate" means
0.120 gallons per Heating Degree Day.   (v) "Budget Price" means $1.399 per
gallon.   (vi) "Number of Budget Program Customers at Closing" means the
number  of customers at Closing as set forth on a certificate delivered by
Sellers  to Purchaser at the Closing, which certificate shall be reasonably 
acceptable to Purchaser.   (c) If Sellers disagree with Purchaser\'s
calculation of Credit Balance Settlement Statement delivered pursuant to
Section 3.5(a), Sellers may, within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of
the Credit Balance Settlement Statement, deliver a notice to Purchaser
disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth Sellers\' calculation of
such amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or
amounts as to which Sellers disagree, and Sellers shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Credit Balance
Settlement Statement and the calculation of the Credit Balance Settlement
Statement delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(a). Purchaser shall provide or
make available to Sellers such information as they may reasonably request to
verify the information contained in the "Credit Balance Settlement Statement"
including, without limitation, providing Sellers with information concerning
the cumulative heating degree days recorded at each of Sellers\' 89 separate
heating degree day monitors across its marketing territory for each month
subsequent to the Closing Date through March 31, 2004 within 15 days after
the conclusion of each such month.   (d) If a notice of disagreement shall
be duly delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(c), Purchaser and Sellers shall,
during the ten (10) days following such delivery, use their reasonable best
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or     24   amounts
in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of the Cash Settlement
of Credit Balances, which amount shall not be more than the amount thereof
shown in Purchaser\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(c) nor
less than the amount thereof shown in Sellers\' calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(c). If during such period, Purchaser and
Sellers are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter
cause the Accounting Referee to review this Agreement and the disputed items
or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Cash Settlement of Credit
Balances (it being understood that in making such calculation, the Accounting
Referee shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). In
making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those
items or amounts in the Credit Balance Settlement Statement and Sellers\'
calculation of Cash Settlement of Credit Balances as to which Sellers have
disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Purchaser and Sellers, as
promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than thirty (30) days from
the date of engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth
such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and
Sellers. The cost of such review and report shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and Sellers.   (e) Purchaser and Sellers shall, and shall cause
their respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation
of the Credit Balance Settlement Statement and the calculation of the Cash
Settlement of Credit Balances and in the conduct of the review referred to in
this Section 3.5, including, without limitation, the making available to the
extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.   (f) The
amount of the Final Cash Settlement of Credit Balances (as defined below), if
any, shall be disbursed promptly from the Credit Balance Escrow Fund by the
Escrow Agent to Purchaser, and, if there is any remaining Credit
Balance Escrow Fund after any such disbursement to Purchaser, such remaining
Credit Balance Escrow Fund shall be promptly disbursed to Sellers. In no
event shall Seller be obligated to pay Purchaser more than the Credit Balance
Escrow Fund, which is an absolute cap on Sellers\' Liability with respect to
the Cash Settlement of Credit Balances. "Final Cash Settlement of Credit
Balances" means the Cash Settlement of Credit Balances (i) as shown in
Purchaser\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(a) if no notice of
disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section
3.5(c); or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed
by Purchaser and Sellers pursuant to Section 3.5(d) or (B) in the absence of
such agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referee\'s calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 3.5(d); provided, however, that in no event shall the
Final Cash Settlement of Credit Balances be more than Purchaser\'s
calculation of the Cash Settlement of Credit Balances delivered pursuant to
Section 3.5(a) or less than Sellers\' calculation of the Cash Settlement of
Credit Balances delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(c).     25    ARTICLE

action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under
the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. Each of Purchaser

the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively,
the "Antitrust Laws"); provided that Purchaser as a condition to the
resolution of any of such obligations shall not be obligated to dispose or
otherwise divest itself of any of its assets. In connection therewith, if any
Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of any
Antitrust Law, each of Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate and use its best
efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all reasonable avenues
of administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action,
unless, by mutual agreement, Purchaser and Sellers decide that litigation is
not in their respective best interests.   7.5 Alternative Transaction. From

disposition of equity securities of Sellers ("Equity") or all
or substantially all of the assets of any or all of Sellers or engaging in a
public offering of the Equity or all or substantially all of the assets of
any or all of Sellers (or of another security derived from the Equity) of any
or all of Sellers (an "Alternative Transaction"), and nothing herein shall
prohibit Seller Group from responding to requests for information regarding
an Alternative Transaction or otherwise facilitating the auction process
contemplated by the Bidding Procedures Order. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that until the earlier of (x) the entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the
Approval Order and (y) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, the Seller Group shall be permitted to pursue Alternative
Transactions, including, but not limited to, supplying information relating
to Sellers or the Equity to prospective purchasers of the Equity or all or
substantially all of the assets of any or all of Sellers or prospective
underwriters or purchasers of the Equity or all or substantially all of the
assets of any or all of Sellers in a public offering. None of the Seller
Group shall have any liability to Purchaser, either under or relating to this
Agreement or any applicable Law, by virtue of entering into or seeking
Bankruptcy Court approval of such a definitive agreement for an Alternative
Transaction pursuant to this     48   Section 7.5; provided, that
Purchaser is paid any Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee that may be
payable pursuant to Section 4.7 at the time provided for therein.   7.6

reasonable efforts to (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to

the information provided to it in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the
confidentiality agreement between Sellers\' representative, executed on May
9, 2003 on behalf of Sellers, and Purchaser, executed by Purchaser on April

financial information and other information Purchaser reasonably determines
is required to be disclosed by the rules and regulations of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in Purchaser\'s filings with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or in any private placement memoranda
and to its lenders, underwriters and rating agencies. Effective upon, and
only upon, the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
with respect to information relating solely to the Business or otherwise
included in the Purchased Assets; provided, however, that Purchaser
acknowledges that any and all other Confidential Information provided to it
by Sellers, their Affiliates or their representatives concerning Sellers
shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply to information contained in this
Agreement or the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto or as to matters
which are part of the Bankruptcy Court record or otherwise known to the
general public.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein or in any other agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or
by which they are bound, the obligations of confidentiality contained herein
and therein, as they relate to the transactions described in this Agreement,
shall not apply to the Tax structure or Tax treatment of the transactions
described in this Agreement, and each party hereto (and any employee,
representative, or agent of any party hereto) may disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax structure and Tax treatment
of the transactions described in this Agreement and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analysis) that are provided to such party
relating to such Tax treatment and Tax structure; provided, however, that
such disclosure shall not include the name (or other identifying information
not relevant to the Tax structure or Tax treatment) of any person and shall
not include information for which nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in
order to comply with applicable securities laws.     49    7.8
Preservation of Records. Sellers and Purchaser agree that each of them shall
preserve and keep the records (including work papers and electronic
files associated with Tax Returns regarding sale, use, excise and Product)
held by it or their Affiliates relating to the Business for a period of seven
(7) years from the Closing Date and shall make such records and personnel
available to the other as may be reasonably required by such party in
connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by, legal
proceedings or tax audits against or governmental investigations of Sellers
or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable Sellers or
Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement
and each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby. In the event Sellers or Purchaser wishes to destroy such records
prior or after that time, such party shall first give ninety (90) days prior
written notice to the other and such other party shall have the right at its
option and expense, upon prior written notice given to such party within that
ninety (90) day period, to take possession of the records within one hundred
and eighty (180) days after the date of such notice.   7.9 Publicity.
Neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party
hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless,
in the sole judgment of Purchaser or Sellers, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which Purchaser or Sellers lists securities, provided that the
party intending to make such release shall use its best efforts consistent
with such applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the
text thereof.   7.10 Contacts with Suppliers and Customers. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the Closing, (i) without
the prior written consent of Sellers, which may be withheld for any reason,
Purchaser shall not contact any customers of the Business, and (ii) Purchaser
shall not contact any suppliers to the Business without the prior written
consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   7.11 Bonds. Sellers and Agway shall continue to maintain the
Bonds issued on behalf of or at the request of any Seller that are in effect
on the Closing Date until such time as Purchaser, using its reasonable best
efforts, causes Purchaser\'s surety to replace the Bonds. In the event that
an obligee under any of the Bonds makes a claim thereunder as a result of
Purchaser\'s breach or alleged breach of any of the Bonds\' provisions,
Purchaser shall promptly indemnify and hold harmless any Seller or Agway from
any such surety\'s demand for indemnification under such surety
indemnification agreement.   7.12 Supplementation and Amendment of
Schedules. From time to time prior to the Closing, Sellers shall have the
right to, or will upon the reasonable request of Purchaser, supplement or
amend the Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or
discovered after the delivery of the Schedules pursuant to this Agreement
that, if existing or known at, or occurring prior to, the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Schedules. No such supplement or     50   amendment shall have any
effect on the satisfaction of the condition to closing set forth in Section
9.1(a); provided, however, if the Closing shall occur, then Purchaser shall
be deemed to have waived any right or claim pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or otherwise, including pursuant to Article X hereof, with respect
to any and all matters disclosed pursuant to any such supplement or amendment
at or prior to the Closing.   7.13 Bidding Procedures. Within five (5) days
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Agway shall file the
Bidding Procedures Motion and the Sale Motion with the Bankruptcy Court. If
the Bidding Procedures Order and the Approval Order, as entered, do not
conform to Exhibits A and B hereto, respectively, Purchaser shall have one
(1) Business Day after Purchaser\'s receipt of notification of the entry of
each such order to notify Sellers in writing that Purchaser elects, in its
sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement.   7.14 Agway Name.   (a)
Within thirty (30) days following the Closing, each Seller shall file
a certificate of amendment of such Seller\'s certificate of incorporation
or certificate of formation, as the case may be, with the Secretary of State
of Delaware, changing its corporate or limited liability company name, as the
case may be, to remove any reference to the name "Agway", or any similar name
or derivative thereof.   (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that:   (i) Sellers are
conveying exclusively to Purchaser all of their  rights, title and interests
to use the "AGWAY" name as a trade name or  service name and any related
Marks solely in connection with the Business,  such rights, title and
interests being limited to the use of the "AGWAY"  name as part of a trade
name or service name in connection with the  Business such that the trade
name or service name must include an  additional term describing or

involved (e.g., "AGWAY ENERGY," AGWAY  PROPANE," "AGWAY OIL");   (ii)
Sellers shall not grant, and has not granted, the rights conveyed  to
Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.14(b)(i) to any Person other than

AGWAY  name outside of the Business and to use the AGWAY name within the
Business  only as permitted pursuant to this Section 7.14;   (iv) this

use, the trade name or service name "AGWAY", or any  similar name or
derivative thereof, by itself (without regard to whether a  type of entity
designation is used with the AGWAY name) for a business or  entity formed
and/or operated by or for Purchaser in connection with the  Business;    
51    (v) Agway owns, and nothing in this Agreement transfers to or
grants  to Purchaser any right, title or interest in or to, the AGWAY name,
or any  similar name or derivative thereof, including any trademark and
service  mark registrations for the AGWAY mark, in connection with any
business,  products, and/or services outside of the Business (the "Other
AGWAY  Marks");   (vi) the Other AGWAY Marks are not part of the Purchased
Intellectual  Property; and   (vii) Agway has licensed, and nothing
contained in this Agreement  limits Agway\'s right to license, third parties
to use the Other AGWAY  Marks.   (c) Purchaser acknowledges that Agway
intends to transfer to third parties some or all of the Other AGWAY Marks,
including any trademark and service mark registrations of the Other AGWAY
Marks; and Purchaser hereby releases Agway and Sellers from any and all
liability in connection with any transfer or transfers of the Other AGWAY
Marks.   7.15 Retention of Funds. From and after the Closing until (i)
Sellers shall have paid to Purchaser any amounts owed to Purchaser pursuant
to Section 3.4(f) or (ii) it shall have been determined pursuant to Section

shall retain an amount of funds equal to the greater of (A) $1,000,000 and

transaction for each such property ("LNA") or   (ii) a remediation agreement
to permit closing to occur prior to ISRA  compliance pursuant to N.J.S.A
13:1K-9 which shall be acceptable to  Purchaser and shall name Purchaser as
the ordered party ("Remediation  Agreement") for any of Sellers\' Properties
located in New Jersey for which  an LNA is not available (the receipt of
either documents referred to in  clauses (i) and (ii) shall herein be
referred to as "ISRA Closing  Compliance") and Sellers shall have delivered a
copy thereof to Purchaser.   (b) From and after Closing, Purchaser shall
comply with Sellers\' ISRA obligations arising from the transactions
contemplated herein. Purchaser shall cooperate     52   with Sellers
and shall provide Sellers with access to the facilities at reasonable times
in order for Sellers to accomplish any actions required by the State of New
Jersey to the extent Purchaser is not complying with such obligations.

Date (collectively, the "State Tax Liabilities"), it being understood that it
is neither a condition to Closing or covenant of Sellers that any Tax
Clearance Certificates be received. Sellers shall reserve not of less than
$900,000 of cash, which shall be used solely for the purpose of paying State
Tax Liabilities until the earlier to occur of (i) receipt by Seller of such
Tax Clearance Certificates and (ii) 15 months following the Closing Date.
Sellers shall provide to Purchaser any Tax Clearance Certificates it
receives.   7.18 Formation of LLC. Notwithstanding anything else contained
herein, in order to facilitate the transfer at Closing to Purchaser of the
Purchased Assets that are Tangible Property, prior to the Closing, Sellers
shall transfer all of such Tangible Property to a newly formed single member
limited liability company ("LLC I"), which shall in turn transfer all of the
Tangible Property that are non-propane assets to a second limited liability
company (LLC II"), which shall be wholly owned by LLC I (it being understood
that membership interests in LLC I and LLC II are Purchased Assets).   7.19
Assumption, Assignment and Transfer by Agway. At Closing and pursuant to
Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court

and subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, Agway shall sell, transfer, assign,
convey and deliver to Purchaser all of Agway\'s right, title and interest in
and to those Owned Properties that Agway owns.   7.20 Conveyance of Title.
Notwithstanding anything else provided herein, title to any titled Purchased
Asset shall be conveyed to Purchaser only upon the certificate of title
relating to any such titled Purchased Assets having been executed by the
relevant Seller and delivered to Purchaser, which may occur after the
Closing. To the extent such transfer of title occurs after the Closing,
Sellers shall deliver powers of attorney relating to the execution of the
certificates of title to each of the titled Purchased Assets in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers authorizing
the execution of such certificates of title on behalf of Sellers. Such powers
of attorney shall appoint an employee of Purchaser. In the event that any
such power attorneys lapse under applicable law, Sellers agree to promptly
execute replacement powers of attorney upon the request of Purchaser.
Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge that any such delay in the transfer of
title is necessary to facilitate the orderly transfer of title.    
53    ARTICLE VIII   EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS   8.1
Employment.   (a) Transferred Employees. At least ten (10) days prior to the
Closing, Purchaser shall deliver, in writing, an offer of employment to the
Chief Operating Officer, all field employees, including the general managers,
and any other Employee that Purchaser identifies prior to Closing as critical
to Purchaser\'s operation of the Business, with such employment to
commence immediately following the Closing, and Purchaser shall deliver to
Sellers at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing a list of those Employees
to whom Purchaser is offering employment. Except as set forth on Schedule
8.1, which may be amended up to ten (10) days prior to the Closing, each such
offer of employment shall be at the same salary or hourly wage rate and
position in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Such individuals who
accept such offer by the Closing Date are hereinafter referred to as the
"Transferred Employees."   (b) Standard Procedure. Pursuant to the "Standard
Procedure" provided in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 96-60, 1996-2 C.B. 399,
(i) Purchaser and Sellers shall report on a predecessor/successor basis as
set forth therein, (ii) Sellers will not be relieved from filing a Form W-2
or Form 1099 with respect to any Transferred Employees or independent
contractor, as the case may be, and (iii) Purchaser will undertake to file
(or cause to be filed) a Form W-2 for each such Transferred Employee with
respect to the portion of the year during which such Employees are employed
by Purchaser that includes the Closing Date, excluding the portion of such
year that such Employee was employed by Sellers.   8.2 Employee
Benefits.   (a) Purchaser shall provide employee benefits to the Transferred
Employees which are substantially similar to those provided by Purchaser to
similarly situated active employees of Purchaser including, without
limitation, with respect to severance, vacations and incentive compensation.
For purposes of eligibility, vesting and rate of vacation accrual or
severance pay, if applicable, but not benefit accrual for any other purpose,
under the employee benefit plans of Purchaser providing benefits to
Transferred Employees (the "Purchaser Plans"), Purchaser shall credit each
Transferred Employee with his or her years of service with Sellers and any
predecessor entities, to the same extent as such Transferred Employee was
entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service under
any similar Employee Benefit Plan. For the purpose of determining incentive
compensation (not including any retention compensation set forth as "Minimum
Guarantee" on Schedule 8.2(e)(ii)) the ("Minimum Guarantee")), for any
Transferred Employee under Purchaser\'s compensation plans, Purchaser shall
take into account his or her performance since July 1, 2003, the commencement
of Sellers\' current fiscal year. Purchaser shall accept a trust to trust
transfer of assets and liabilities from Sellers\' Savings Plan to
Purchaser\'s Savings Plan of the account attributable to   
54   Transferred Employees, at each Transferred Employee\'s option. Such
trust to trust transfer shall be made in cash and notes representing
participant loans in accordance with the requirements of Section 414(l) of
the Code, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date.   (b)
Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, with respect to Purchaser\'s
group health plans, Purchaser shall as of the Closing Date either establish
group health plans for the Transferred Employees that are substantially
similar to those that such Employees participated in immediately prior to
Closing, or shall enroll the Transferred Employees in the Purchaser Plans
which cover similarly situated employees of Purchaser. Any group health plan
of Purchaser shall take into account employment with any Seller for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate. Transferred Employees shall
participate without any waiting periods, without evidence of insurability,
and without application of pre-existing physical or mental condition
limitations except to the extent applicable under such similar Employee
Benefit Plans. Purchaser shall count claims arising during the calendar year
on or prior to the effective date of coverage for purposes of satisfying
deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, and all other similar limitations under
the welfare plans of Purchaser. Sellers shall provide Purchaser with
schedules as of the Closing Date in such form as is mutually convenient to
the parties, and update such schedules immediately thereafter, which reflect
the deductibles satisfied, amounts credited toward out-of-pocket maximums and
any other similar limitations as of the Closing Date.   (c) Nothing
contained in this Article VIII or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to prevent the termination of employment of any
individual Transferred Employee or any change in the employee benefits
available to any individual Transferred Employee provided such change applies
to similarly situated employees of Purchaser.   (d) Accrued Vacation.
Except as required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall be responsible for all
Liabilities with respect to Transferred Employees attributable to their
accrued and unused vacation, sick days and personal days earned with Sellers
through the Closing Date.   (e) With respect to Employees that are not
Transferred Employees, Sellers shall be responsible for all Liabilities under
applicable law or the terms of Sellers\' Employee Benefit Plans, including
all Liabilities arising under WARN or Sellers\' employee pension benefit
plans and Sellers\' Liability to provide continued group health coverage
under Part 6, Subtitle A of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code,
except as provided below. To the extent Sellers\' Liability to such Employees
under any severance arrangement, or on account of incentive compensation
under the plans set forth on Schedule 8.2(e)(i) or accrued and unused
vacation, exceeds an aggregate amount of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000)
(the "Employee Benefit Cap"), Purchaser shall assume such Liability in excess
of the Employee Benefit Cap; provided that Sellers shall be
solely responsible for all Liabilities related to severance and incentive
compensation that represents a Minimum Guarantee (the "Excluded Bonus
Amounts") of Sellers\' executives     55   who are not Transferred
Employees who are set forth on Schedule 8.2(e)(ii), and provided, further,
any such Liabilities related to the Excluded Bonus Amounts shall not be
applied to the Employee Benefit Cap. Purchaser shall assume all Liabilities
in respect of incentive compensation of Transferred Employees under Sellers\'
plans accrued, earned and unpaid for during Sellers\' current fiscal year
through the Closing Date (and, to the extent so accrued and earned, Purchaser
shall have no additional obligation to provide incentive compensation under
Section 8.2(a) hereof for such period); provided, however, that Sellers shall
pay the Minimum Guarantee directly to the applicable Transferred
Employees and Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Sellers therefor but not
with respect to any matching payments under Sellers\' or Agway\'s pension or
other employee benefit plans.   ARTICLE IX   CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

Agreement.   ARTICLE X   INDEMNIFICATION   10.1 Survival of
Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing through and
including the date that is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (other
than representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.8 and 5.17, each
of which shall survive through and including the three (3) year anniversary
of the Closing Date) (as applicable, the "Survival Period"); provided,
however, that any obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall

with Section 10.4(a) before the termination of the applicable Survival
Period.   10.2 Indemnification by Sellers.   (a) Subject to Sections 7.12,

Parties") harmless from and against:   (i) any and all losses, liabilities,
obligations, damages, costs and  expenses (individually, a "Loss" and,

breach of any representation or  warranty of any Seller set forth in Article
V hereof, or any representation  or warranty contained in any certificate

any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from  the breach
of any covenant or other agreement on the part of any Seller  under this

provided, however, that Sellers\' obligations to indemnify and hold harmless

terminate fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date except with  respect to
any Losses as to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall  have given
notice to Sellers in accordance with Section 10.4(a) before the  expiration
of such period and, provided, further, that neither the  immediately
preceding provision nor Section 10.9 shall preclude Sellers  from challenging
any claim asserting that it is liable for an Excluded  Liability following
the expiration of such period other than with respect  to any Environmental
Liabilities, for which Purchasers\' sole and exclusive  recourse against any
Seller shall be pursuant to Section 10.10.   (b) Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that Sellers shall not have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any Loss to the extent that such Loss relates to action taken
by Purchaser or any other Person (other than Sellers in breach of this
Agreement) after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall take and shall cause its
Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise
thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to
remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss.   (c) The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the General Indemnity Escrow Fund and the
Environmental Indemnity Escrow Fund have been created for the purpose and as
the sole and exclusive source of satisfying Sellers\' obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in accordance
with this Section 10.2(a)(i), Section 10.5 and Section 10.10, respectively,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein.   10.3 Indemnification by
Purchaser.   (a) Subject to Sections 10.1 and 10.5, Purchaser hereby agrees
to indemnify and hold Sellers and its directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against:   (i) any and all
Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from  the breach of any
representation or warranty of Purchaser set forth in  Article VI hereof, or
any representation or warranty contained in any  certificate delivered by or
on behalf of Purchaser pursuant to this  Agreement;     59    (ii) any
and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from  the breach of
any covenant or other agreement on the part of Purchaser  under this

any  Assumed Liability;   (iv) all Losses based upon or arising directly

and   (v) any and all Expenses incident to the foregoing.   (b) Sellers
shall take and cause its Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate
any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected
to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss.   10.4
Indemnification Procedures.   (a) If any of the Persons to be indemnified
under this Article X has suffered or incurred any Loss (regardless of any
limitations provided in Section 10.5 hereof), the indemnified party shall so
notify the party from whom indemnification is sought promptly in writing
describing such Loss, the amount or estimated amount thereof, if known or
reasonably capable of estimation, and the method of computation of such Loss,
all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or
certificate delivered pursuant hereto in respect of which such Loss shall
have occurred. If any action at Law or suit in equity is instituted by or
against a third party with respect to which the indemnified party intends to
claim any Loss under this Article X, the indemnified party shall promptly
notify the indemnifying party of such action or suit and tender to the
indemnifying party the defense of such action or suit. A failure by
the indemnified party to give notice and to tender the defense of the action
or suit in a timely manner pursuant to this Section 10.4 shall not limit the
obligations of the indemnifying party under this Article X, except (i) to the
extent such indemnifying party is prejudiced thereby, (ii) to the extent
expenses are incurred during the period in which notice was not provided and
(iii) as provided by Section 10.1.   (b) If any claim, demand or liability
is asserted by any third party against any Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume control of the
defense of any actions or proceedings brought against the indemnified party
in respect of matters embraced by the indemnity and thereafter shall not be
liable for the expenses of the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party
fails to assume the defense of any such matter within thirty (30) days after
request by the indemnified party to assume such defense, the indemnified
party may assume control of the defense of the claim. In all cases, the party
without the right to control the defense of the indemnifiable claim may
participate in the defense at its own expense.    60   Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 10.4 to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party
nor the indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the other
party, settle or compromise any indemnifiable claim or permit a default or
consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant and such party provide
to such other party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of
the indemnifiable claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement
offer solely for money damages is made by the applicable third party
claimant, and the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in
writing of the indemnifying party\'s willingness to accept the settlement
offer and, subject to the limitations of Sections 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7, pay
the amount called for by such offer, and the indemnified party declines to
accept such offer, the indemnified party may continue to contest such
indemnifiable claim, free of any participation by the indemnifying party, and
the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such indemnifiable claim
that the indemnifying party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be
limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement offer that the
indemnified party declined to accept plus the Losses of the indemnified party
relating to such indemnifiable claim through the date of its rejection of the
settlement offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with
respect to such indemnifiable claim. If the indemnifying party makes any
payment on any indemnifiable claim, the indemnifying party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the
indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the
indemnified party with respect to such indemnifiable claim.   10.5 Certain
Limitations on Indemnification.   (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any Person making an indemnification claim under Section 10.2(a)(i)
or 10.3(a)(i) must give notice to the indemnifying party of any such
indemnification claim in writing in reasonable detail prior to the expiration
of the applicable Survival Period. Any indemnification claim not made on or
prior to that date will be irrevocably and unconditionally released and
waived.   (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an
indemnifying party shall not have any liability under Section 10.2(a)(i) or
10.3(a)(i) (as applicable):   (i) with respect to any individual claim (or
group of related claims  of the same Person having, in each case,
substantially similar factual or  legal basis) for the breach of a
representation or warranty, unless and  until the Losses claimed exceed
$15,000 (the "De Minimis Amount");   (ii) unless and until the amount of the
Losses to the indemnified  parties finally determined to arise thereunder
based upon, related to or  resulting from the breach of all representations
and warranties exceeds, in  the aggregate $1,000,000 (the "Deductible"),
disregarding any individual  claim that does not exceed the De Minimis
Amount, at which time such Losses  shall be recoverable from the first dollar
of Loss; and     61    (iii) with respect to any Losses of Purchaser
that arise under or are  based upon, related to or resulting from the breach
by any Seller of any  representation and warranty (including Section 5.8) set
forth in this  Agreement other than Section 5.17 and 10.10, Purchaser\'s only
recourse  shall be shall be the General Indemnity Escrow Fund, which shall
serve as a  cap on all such Losses (such that Sellers shall have no liability
to  Purchaser in excess of the funds held in such escrow) and shall remain
in  escrow until fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date, with any
remaining  funds in excess of $500,000 (such $500,000, the "Tax Escrow")
being  disbursed to Sellers on the date that is fifteen (15) months after
the  Closing Date; provided, however, that if Purchaser has one or more
claims  pending in respect of (i) the breach of any representation or
warranty  other than those contained in Section 5.17 or (ii) any other Losses
for  which Sellers are required to indemnify Purchaser for pursuant to
Section  10.2 on the date that is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date,
a  portion of any remaining General Indemnity Escrow Fund (not including
the  Tax Escrow) equal to the reasonable amount of such claims (or, if the 
reasonable amount of such claims exceeds the amount of the remaining  General
Indemnity Escrow Fund, the remaining amount of such funds) shall be  retained
by the Escrow Agent pending the resolution thereof. The Tax Escrow  shall
remain in escrow until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing  Date to
serve as the source of indemnification of Purchaser with respect to  any
Losses that arise under or are based upon, related to or resulting from  the
breach of any representation and warranty set forth in Section 5.8,  with any
remaining General Indemnity Escrow Fund being disbursed to Sellers  on the
third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that  if
Purchaser has one or more claims pending in respect of the breach of any 
representation or warranty contained in Section 5.8 on the third (3rd) 
anniversary of the Closing Date, a portion of any remaining Tax Escrow  equal
to the reasonable amount of such claims (or, if the reasonable amount  of
such claims exceeds the amount of the remaining Tax Escrow, the  remaining
amount of such funds) shall be retained by the Escrow Agent  pending the
resolution thereof. This Section 10.5(b)(iii) shall not in any  way limit the
amount or time period for which Purchaser shall be entitled  to be
indemnified by Sellers under Section 10.2 with respect to State Tax 
Liabilities.   (c) No representation or warranty of Sellers contained herein
shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and Sellers shall not be deemed to have
breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of
any fact, circumstance or event of which (a) it is manifestly evident that
such fact, circumstance or event is disclosed in response to another
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or (b) Purchaser is
aware as of the Closing Date.   (d) Purchaser shall not make any claim for
indemnification under this Article X in respect of any Losses that is taken
into account in the calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 3.4 and in respect of any of Sellers\' representation or
warranty regarding Inventory to the extent taken into account in the
calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
3.4.     62    10.6 Calculation of Losses.   (a) The amount of any
Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article X shall be
net of any amounts actually recovered or recoverable by the indemnified party
under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such Losses (net of any
Tax or expenses incurred in connection with such recovery).   (b) If the
amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article X
gives rise to a currently realizable Tax benefit (as defined below) to the
Indemnified Party making the claim, then the indemnity claim shall be (i)
increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the
indemnified party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder
(grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of any net
Tax benefit realized by the indemnified party arising from the incurrence or
payment of any such Loss. To the extent such indemnity claim does not give
rise to a currently realizable Tax benefit, if the amount with respect to
which any indemnity claim is made gives rise to a subsequently realized Tax
benefit to the indemnified party that made the claim, such indemnified party
shall refund to the indemnifying party the amount of such Tax benefit (with
and including any gross-up payment made pursuant to this Section 10.6 with
respect to such Tax benefit) when, as and if realized (it being understood
that such indemnified party shall use its reasonable efforts to realize such
Tax benefit). For purposes of this Section 10.6, a "Tax benefit" means an
amount by which the Tax liability of the party (or group of corporations
including the party) is actually reduced (including by deduction, reduction
of income by virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to
refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received from the
relevant Tax Authority. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax
benefit, the indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items
of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item
arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence
or payment of any indemnified Loss. For purposes of this Section 10.6, a Tax
benefit is "currently realizable" to the extent that such Tax benefit can be
realized in the current taxable period or year or in any Tax Return with
respect thereto (including through a carryback to a prior taxable period) or
in any taxable period or year prior to the date of the indemnity claim. The
amount of any increase, reduction or payment hereunder shall be adjusted to
reflect any final determination (which shall include the execution of Form
870-AD or successor form) with respect to the indemnified party\'s liability
for Taxes, and payments between the parties to this Agreement to reflect such
adjustment shall be made if necessary. Any indemnity payment under this
Article X shall be treated as an adjustment to the value of the asset upon
which the underlying claim was based, unless a final determination
(which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with
respect to the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates causes any such
payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the value of the asset for
United States federal income tax purposes.   10.7 Characterization of
Indemnity Payments. Sellers and Purchaser agree to treat any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this Article X as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes.    
63    10.8 No Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no party (or any of its Affiliates)
shall, in any event, be liable to any other party (or any of its Affiliates)
for any consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages of such other
party (or any of its Affiliates), including loss of future revenue, income or
profits, diminution of value or loss of business reputation or opportunity
relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof.   10.9 Exclusive Remedy.
Subject to Section 11.4 hereof and except for common law fraud in the
inducement under which a common law court would abrogate this Agreement and
except as otherwise provided in Section 10.10, the sole and exclusive remedy
of Sellers and Purchaser for any breach or inaccuracy, or alleged breach or
inaccuracy, of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by
Sellers or Purchaser shall be indemnification in accordance with this Article
X, which indemnification obligation shall be effective solely upon the
Closing. Subject to the exceptions set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, in furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims
and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) known
or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future,
that it may have against Sellers or any of its Affiliates, or Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any
federal, state or local Law (including any such Law relating to environmental
matters or arising under or based upon any securities Law, common Law or
otherwise).   10.10 Environmental Liabilities and the Environmental
Indemnity Escrow Fund.   (a) As used herein the following terms shall have
the following meanings:   "Property" shall mean any property currently or
formerly owned, leased or used by any Seller.   "Remediation" shall mean
all reasonably necessary actions to investigate, monitor and/or cleanup,
including, without limitation, the preliminary assessment, site
investigation, remedial investigation, remedial selection and remedial
action, in accordance with Environmental Laws.   "Pre-Existing Hazardous
Materials" shall mean Hazardous Materials Released prior to the Closing,
including any migration or dispersal of such Hazardous Materials.   (b)
Purchaser shall be entitled to payment from the Environmental
Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the Environmental Indemnity Escrow
Agreement for all Losses of Purchaser arising from: (i) the presence of Pre-
Existing Hazardous Materials on, at, under or migrating from the Property,
including, without limitation, all costs of Remediation of Hazardous
Materials on, at, under or migrating from any Property pursuant to
Environmental Laws including Remediation of Sellers\' Properties to standards
under Environmental Laws applicable to non-residential use, whether
such     64   Remediation is voluntary or involuntary; (ii) any
violation of Environmental Laws that occurred prior to the Closing Date by
any Seller or for which any Seller has Liability; (iii) compliance with
Environmental Laws at any property to which any Seller sent materials for
disposal or for which Seller has Liability under Environmental Laws arising
from an occurrence prior to the Closing Date; and (iv) any and all Losses
based upon, attributed to, or resulting from a breach of Sections 5.17 or
7.16, (i) through (iv) collectively "Environmental Liabilities". In the event
that any of Sellers\' Properties are subject to ISRA, Purchaser may fund any
financial assurance required by ISRA from the Environmental Indemnity Escrow
Fund as provided in the Environmental Indemnity Escrow Agreement.   (c)
With respect to any Environmental Liabilities that arise under or are based
upon, related to or resulting from Section 10.10, other than as set forth in
Sections 10.10(d) and (e), Purchaser\'s exclusive recourse shall be
the Environmental Indemnity Escrow Fund, which shall serve as an absolute cap
on all such Losses (such that Sellers shall have no liability to Purchaser in
excess of the funds held in such escrow) and, subject to the terms of the
Environmental Escrow Agreement, shall remain in escrow until the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date, with any remaining Environmental Indemnity
Escrow Fund being disbursed to Sellers on the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that if Purchaser has one or more claims
pending in respect to Losses under Section 10.10 on the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date, a portion of any remaining Environmental
Indemnity Escrow Fund equal to the reasonable amount of such claims (or, if
the reasonable amount of such claims exceeds the amount of the remaining
Environmental Indemnity Escrow Fund, the remaining amount of such funds)
shall be retained by the Escrow Agent pending the resolution thereof.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser\'s right to recovery from the Environmental Indemnity Escrow Fund,
including for breaches of the representations and covenants, set forth at
Sections 5.17 and 7.16, shall not be subject to Section 7.12, Section 10.2(b)
and Sections 10.4 through 10.7 of this Agreement.   (d) In furtherance of
the foregoing and subject to Section 10.10(b) and (e), Purchaser hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other
rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if
any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in
the future, that it may have against Sellers or any of their Affiliates,
arising under or based upon any Environmental Laws; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not apply to those rights, claims and causes of action
for Environmental Liabilities (i) for which Sellers have received notice
prior to the Closing Date that relate to any property other than any Owned
Property or Leased Real Property or (ii) to the extent coverage may
be available under Sellers\' Policies pursuant to this Section 10.10, in
which case the provisions contained in Section 10.10(e)(vii) shall apply.  
(e) Sellers shall make available to Purchaser at premises of Sellers
copies and evidence of general liability insurance policies, excess liability
insurance policies and environmental liability policies ("Sellers\'
Policies") that are in Sellers\'     65   possession or control and
that were in effect at any time prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser may at
Purchaser\'s expense make and retain photocopies of Sellers\' Policies.  
(ii) To the extent Purchaser\'s Environmental Liabilities exceed, or  are
estimated to exceed, in the aggregate, the amount of the Environmental 
Indemnity Escrow Deposit, Purchaser shall have the right to file claims 
under Sellers\' Policies to recover Environmental Liabilities and shall have 
the right to pursue any rights, claims and causes of action of any Seller 
against third parties, other than the Sellers.   (iii) In the event that
Purchaser\'s Environmental Liabilities exceed  or are estimated to exceed the
amount of the Environmental Indemnity Escrow  Deposit, Purchaser shall
provide Sellers with written notice thereof  pursuant to Section 11.9 hereof
and Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser,  with respect to recovery of
Purchaser\'s Environmental Liabilities pursuant  to Sellers\' Policies and
any rights, claims and causes of action against  any third party, which
cooperation shall include using Sellers\'  commercially reasonable efforts to
supply relevant documents and  information and permitting Purchaser, at
Purchaser\'s discretion, to pursue  at Purchaser\'s expense such insurance
coverage or rights, claims, or causes  of action against third parties in the
name of any Seller. Within thirty  (30) days of Sellers\' receipt of
Purchasers\' notice pursuant to this  Section 10.10(e)(iii), Sellers shall
provide Purchaser with written notice  of Sellers\' representative for the
purpose of cooperation pursuant to this  Section 10.10(e). In the event that
Sellers (i) do not provide such notice  within thirty (30) days of Sellers\'
receipt of Purchaser\'s notice pursuant  to this Section 10.10(e) or (ii) in
the event Sellers fail to continue to  diligently cooperate with Purchaser as
provided herein after thirty (30)  days written notice and opportunity to
cure, Purchaser shall be deemed to  be granted an irrevocable power of
attorney to pursue such insurance and  any rights, claims and causes of
action pursuant to the Power of Attorney,  substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit K, which shall be  executed at the Closing but shall not be
exercised by Purchaser unless and  until the occurrence of (i) or (ii) in
this sentence.   (iv) In the event Purchaser is successful in obtaining
coverage under  Sellers\' Policies pursuant to this Section 10.10(e), and in
the event  Sellers are unable to recover, in part or in full, for other
Seller  liabilities under Sellers\' Policies as a result of payment of such 
insurance proceeds to Purchaser, Purchaser agrees to indemnify and defend 
Sellers for the unrecovered amount to the extent of such insurance proceeds 
received by Purchaser.   (v) Purchaser shall be solely responsible, and
shall indemnify and  hold Sellers harmless, for its own costs and all costs
incurred by Sellers  or Sellers\' representative in complying with
Purchaser\'s requests for  information in connection with Purchaser\'s filing
of claims under Sellers\'  Policies or any demands, claims, or causes of
action asserted by Purchaser  against any insurer or any third party in the
name of any Seller.     66    (vi) Nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit Sellers from filing  claims against Sellers\' Policies or
prosecuting and settling such claims  without the prior consent of Purchaser,
provided that Sellers shall provide  notice to Purchaser of any such claims
and settlement and provided that  Sellers shall do nothing to impair
Purchaser\'s rights under this Section  10.10(e), including, without
limitation, by waiving or releasing such  rights in any settlement entered
into by Sellers; provided, however, that  to the extent Sellers\' recovery
depletes coverage limits under Sellers\'  Policies, that depletion shall not
be deemed such a waiver or release of  Purchaser\'s rights.   (vii) As a
condition of payment to Purchasers of proceeds from  Sellers\' Policies,
Purchaser shall irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent  permitted by
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of  action (including
rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown,  foreseen or unforeseen,
which exist or may arise in the future, that it may  have against Sellers or
any of their Affiliates, arising under or based  upon any federal, state or
local Law, including any Environmental Laws,  relating to the same event or
series of events giving rise to the claim for  which insurance proceeds are
obtained. In the event Purchasers are  unsuccessful in obtaining proceeds
from Sellers\' Policies for a claim,  Purchaser shall irrevocably waive, to
the fullest extent permitted by  applicable Law, subject to Section
10.10(d)(i) any and all rights, claims  and causes of action (including
rights of contributions, if any) known or  unknown, foreseen or unforeseen,
which exist or may arise in the future,  that it may have against Sellers or
any of their Affiliates, arising under  or based upon any federal, state or
local Law, including any Environmental  Laws, relating to the same event or
series of events giving rise to the  claim.   (viii) Sellers make no
representation or warranty regarding whether  and to what extent coverage
under Sellers\' Policies may exist or whether  and to what extent third-party
claims may exist. Nothing in this Agreement  shall make Sellers liable to
Purchaser for any provision of self insurance,  copayment, or deductible
under any Sellers\' Policies. Subject to Section  10.10(e)(vi), nothing in
this Agreement shall make Sellers liable to  Purchaser for any defenses to
coverage asserted by any insurer or any third  party.   ARTICLE XI  
MISCELLANEOUS   11.1 Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes.   (a) Each of
Purchaser on one hand and Sellers on the other hand shall be responsible for

assigns against) 50% of any sales Taxes applicable to the Purchased Assets
and for all other applicable sales, use, stamp, documentary,

or dispute. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any
defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.   (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process
being served by any party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding

the party taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise

2003, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. ss.ss. 105, 363(b), (f), (m) and (n), 365 and
1146(c) for an Order authorizing the Debtor to cause Agway Products, LLC,

having presented the highest and best bid for the Purchased Assets as more
particularly identified in Schedule 2.1 of the Asset Purchase Agreement by

(the "Agreement"), a      true copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit "A"; and upon the record of the sale hearing (the "Sale Hearing");
and it appearing that the relief sought by the Debtor is necessary and in the
best interests of the Debtor, its creditors and estate and other parties in
interest; and due deliberation having been had; and sufficient cause
appearing therefor;  THE COURT HEREBY FINDS AND DETERMINES that:(1)   A.
On October 1, 2002 (the "Commencement Date"), the Debtor and five  of its
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors") commenced voluntary cases  under
chapter 11 of Title 11, United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code").   B.
Since the Commencement Date, the Debtors have continued in  possession and
management of their businesses and properties as  debtors-in-possession
pursuant to Sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the  Bankruptcy Code.   C. No
trustee or examiner has been appointed in this case.   D. The Debtor owns
all of the equity interests in the Sellers.   E. The Court has jurisdiction
over the Motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  ss.ss. 157 and 1334. This matter is a
core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  ss. 157(b)(2)(A), (N) and (O). Venue
of this case and the Motion in this  District is proper under 28 U.S.C.
ss.ss. 1408 and 1409.   F. The statutory predicates for the relief sought in
the Motion are  Sections 105(a), 363(b), (f), (m) and (n), 365(a), (c) and
(f), and 1146(c)  of the Bankruptcy Code, and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2002, 6004
and 9014.   ----------   1 Findings of fact shall be construed as
conclusions of law and conclusions of law shall be construed as findings of
fact when appropriate. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052.     2    G. All
capitalized terms in this Order shall have the same definition  as in the
Agreement unless expressly stated otherwise.   H. As evidenced by the
certificate of service previously filed with  the Court, and based on the
representations of counsel at the Sale Hearing:  (i) proper, timely, adequate
and sufficient notice of the Motion and the  Sale Hearing has been provided
in accordance with the Procedures Order;  (ii) such notice was good,
sufficient and appropriate under the particular  circumstances; and (iii) no
other or further notice of the Motion, the Sale  Hearing or the entry of this
Order is or shall be required.   I. A reasonable opportunity to object or be
heard regarding the relief  requested in the Motion has been afforded to all
interested persons and  entities.   J. As evidenced by the record at the
Sale Hearing, the Debtor and the  Sellers have marketed the Purchased Assets
and conducted the sale process  in compliance with the Procedures Order, the
Auction (as defined in the  Procedures Order) was duly noticed and conducted
in a noncollusive, fair,  and good faith manner, and a reasonable opportunity
was provided to any  interested party to make a higher or better offer for
the Purchased Assets.   K. _________\'s offer is memorialized in the
Agreement, which provides  for the sale and transfer of the Purchased Assets
to _________. Such offer  is the highest and best offer received for the
assumption, assignment and  sale of the Purchased Assets.    L. The
purchase price to be paid by __________ is fair and constitutes  reasonably
equivalent value and reasonable market value for the Purchased  Assets.  
M. ___________ is a purchaser in good faith with respect to the  Purchased
Assets as that term is used in Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy  Code. The
Agreement     3    was negotiated, proposed and entered into by the
parties in good faith,  from arm\'s length bargaining positions and without
collusion and,  therefore, __________ is entitled to the protections of
Section 363(m) of  the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Purchased Assets.
Neither the  Debtor nor ___________ has engaged in any conduct that would
cause or  permit the Agreement to be voided under Section 363(n) of the
Bankruptcy  Code.   N. The Debtor has articulated compelling circumstances
and sound  business reasons for causing the Sellers to consummate the
Agreement and to  sell the Purchased Assets as set forth in the Motion
outside of a plan of  reorganization, and it is a reasonable exercise of the
Debtor\'s business  judgment to cause the Sellers to consummate the
transactions contemplated  by the Agreement.   O. The Debtor has full
corporate power and authority to cause the  Sellers to execute the Agreement
and all other documents contemplated  thereby, and to sell the Purchased
Assets to ____________.   P. The Sellers are (and as to certain assets,
Agway is) the sole and  lawful owners of the Purchased Assets. The
assumption, assignment and sale  of the Purchased Assets to ___________ is
and will be a legal, valid and  effective transfer of the Purchased Assets,
and will vest _________ with  all right, title and interest in and to the
Purchased Assets, free and  clear of all liens, security interests,
encumbrances, claims, and interests  which have or could have been asserted
by Agway or its creditors in  connection with its chapter 11 case.    
4    Q. No consents or approvals, other than those expressly provided for 
in the Agreement or expressly set forth herein, are required for the Debtor 
or Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated in the Agreement.  
R. Time is of the essence in closing the transaction and the Debtor,  Sellers
and _________ intend to close the assumption, assignment and sale  of the
Purchased Assets to _________ as soon as possible.   S. Adequate assurance
exists that __________ will fully perform all  future obligations under the
executory contracts and unexpired leases being  assumed and assigned to
__________ under the Agreement (collectively, the  "Assigned
Agreements").    ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED on this _____ day of
December, 2003, as follows:   1. The Motion is hereby granted. All
objections to the Motion or the  relief requested therein that have not been
withdrawn, waived, or settled,  and all reservations of rights included in
such objections, are overruled  on the merits and denied.   2. The
Agreement and all of the transactions contemplated thereby are  approved.  
3. Pursuant to Section 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtor is 
authorized and directed to enter into, perform under, comply with,  implement
and to take all other action as is necessary to consummate the  terms of the
Agreement including, but not limited to, execute and deliver  all additional
agreements, instruments and documents that _________ deems  necessary or
appropriate to the performance of the obligations as  contemplated by the
Agreement, all without any further corporate  authorization or Order of this
Court.     5    4. Pursuant to Sections 365(b), (c) and (f), the
Debtors and the  Sellers are hereby authorized to assume and assign the
Assigned Agreements  to __________. Any pre-Closing defaults under the
Assigned Agreements shall  be cured by the Debtor.   5. Pursuant to
Sections 105 and 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the  Purchased Assets shall
be assigned, sold and transferred to __________ and,  upon the Closing Date
(as defined in the Agreement), shall be free and  clear of all liens,
security interests, encumbrances, claims and interests  ("Liens and Claims")
which have or could have been asserted by Agway or its  creditors in Agway\'s
Chapter 11 case, if any, with all such Liens and  Claims of any kind or
nature whatsoever to attach to the net proceeds that  Agway realizes from the
sale (after satisfaction of all of the Sellers\'  collective indebtedness) in
the order of their priority, with the same  validity, force and effect that
they now have as against the Purchased  Assets, subject to any claims and
defenses the Debtor may possess with  respect thereto.   6. The assumption,
assignment, sale and transfer of the Purchased  Assets to ________ pursuant
to the Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and  effective transfer of the
Purchased Assets and shall vest ________ with all  right, title and interest
of the Sellers in and to the Purchased Assets  free and clear of all Liens
and Claims which have or could have been  asserted by Agway or its creditors
in connection with its chapter 11 case.   7. Pursuant to sections 105(a) and
1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, the  transfer of the Purchased Assets is not
subject to taxation under any  federal, state, local, municipal or other law
imposing or purporting to  impose a stamp, transfer, recording or    
6    any other similar tax on any of the Debtor\'s transfers or conveyances
of  the Purchased Assets, which includes real estate, personal property,
and  any other assets.   8. This Order and the Agreement shall be binding
in all respects upon,  and shall inure to the benefit of, Agway, its estate,
its creditors and  equity interest holders, the Sellers, and _________, and
their respective  affiliates, successors and permitted assigns including,
without limitation,  any chapter 11 or 7 trustee hereinafter appointed for
the Debtor. Nothing  contained in any chapter 11 plan confirmed in this case
or in the order  confirming any such chapter 11 plan shall conflict with or
derogate from  the provisions of the Agreement or this Order.   9.
Consummation of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated  therein and
thereby do not effect a de facto merger or consolidation of the  Debtor and
the Sellers with _________. ________ is not the alter ego of, a  successor-
in-interest to, or a continuation of the Debtor or the Sellers,  and shall
not be liable for the Debtor\'s and Sellers\' debts and  obligations, except
as otherwise explicitly provided in the Agreement.   10. All entities who
may be in possession of some or all of the  Purchased Assets to be conveyed
to ___________ on the Closing Date are  hereby directed to surrender
possession of the Purchased Assets to  __________ on the Closing Date.  
11. The Agreement is not a sub rosa chapter 11 plan for which approval  has
been sought without the protections that a disclosure statement would 
afford, and is not in violation of creditors\' and equity security interest 
holders\' voting rights.   12. The purchase by _______ is a purchase in good
faith for fair value  within the meaning of Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy
Code, and _______ is  entitled to the protection of Section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code if this  Order or any authorization     7    contained
herein is reversed or modified on appeal. Accordingly, the  reversal,
modification or appeal of the authorization provided herein to  consummate
the Agreement and to sell the Purchased Assets shall not affect  the validity
of the assumption, assignment and sale of the Purchased Assets  to _________,
unless such authorization is duly stayed pending such appeal  before the
Closing Date.   13. The sale approved by this Order is not subject to
avoidance  pursuant to Section 363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code. The
consideration  provided by __________ for the Purchased Assets under the
Agreement  constitutes reasonably equivalent value and fair
consideration.    14. On the Closing Date, each of the Debtor\'s creditors
is authorized  and directed to execute such documents and take all other
actions as may be  necessary to release its interest in the Purchased Assets,
if any, as such  interests may have been recorded or may otherwise exist.  
15. Regardless of whether the Debtor\'s creditors execute the releases  set
forth in the above paragraph, this Order (a) shall be effective as a 
determination that, on the Closing Date, all liens, claims, security 
interests and interests of any kind or nature whatsoever existing with 
respect to the Seller and the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing have 
been unconditionally released, discharged and terminated, and that the 
conveyances described herein have been effected, and (b) shall be binding 
upon and shall govern the acts of all entities including without  limitation,
all filing agents, filing officers, title agents, title  companies, recorders
of mortgages, recorders of deeds, registrars of deeds,  administrative
agencies, governmental departments, secretaries of state,  federal, state,
and local officials, and all other persons and entities who  may be required
by     8    operation of law, the duties of their office, or contract,
to accept, file,  register or otherwise record or release any documents or
instruments, or  who may be required to report or insure any title or state
of title in or  to any of the Purchased Assets.   16. The failure
specifically to include any particular provisions of  the Agreement in this
Order shall not diminish or impair the effectiveness  of such provision, it
being the intent of the Court that the Agreement be  authorized and approved
in its entirety.   17. The Agreement and any related agreements, documents
or instruments  may be modified, amended or supplemented by the parties
thereto and in  accordance with the terms hereof, without further order of
the Court,  provided that any such modification, amendment, or supplement
does not have  a material adverse effect on the Debtor\'s estate.   18. As
provided by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 6004(g), 6006(d) and 7062, this  Order shall be
effective and enforceable immediately upon its entry.   19. The provisions
of this Order are non-severable and mutually  dependent.   20. This Court
shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce and  implement the terms and
provisions of, and to resolve any dispute(s)  concerning, this Order, the
Agreement, all amendments thereto, each of the  agreements, documents and
instruments executed in connection therewith, and  the rights and duties of
the parties thereunder including, but not limited  to, all issues and
disputes arising in connection with the relief  authorized herein, inclusive
of those concerning the transfer of the  Purchased Assets free and clear of

terms and conditions (the "Bidding Procedures"):   (a) The Termination
Payments authorized by the Suburban Agreement  shall not be applicable to any
bidders other than Suburban.   (b) In order to bid, a potential bidder must
(i) submit to Debtor\'s  counsel a written irrevocable offer for the
purchased assets that (as  determined by the Debtor and the Sellers, in
consultation with the official  committee of unsecured creditors (the
"Creditors\' Committee")) constitutes  a higher or better bid, in view of the
purchase price offered, the  existence of any proposed holdbacks, escrows or
indemnification provisions,  the overall terms and conditions of the proposed
contract, and after taking  into account the Termination Payments that may be
triggered under the  Suburban Agreement and (ii) deliver an earnest money
deposit to Debtor\'s  counsel of no less than $10,500,000.00 (the "Deposit")
in the form of a  certified check or wire transfer payable to the trust
account of Debtor\'s  counsel at least three (3) business days before the
Auction (as defined  below) (the "Bid Deadline"). The bid must identify the
bidder     3    and contain such documents and information so as to
establish that the  bidder can pay the purchase price at closing.   (c)
Bids must not be subject to financing, environmental, due  diligence or any
other contingencies not provided for in the Suburban  Agreement.   (d) Only
those bids that meet the requirements of the preceding three  (3)
subparagraphs will be considered a "Qualified Bid." For all purposes  herein,
Suburban\'s bid to acquire the purchased assets pursuant to the  Suburban
Agreement shall constitute a Qualified Bid.   (e) If a Qualified Bid (other
than Suburban\'s) is received by the Bid  Deadline, the Debtor and the
Sellers shall conduct the Auction for the sale  of the purchased assets in
this Court, on the 18th day of December, 2003,  at 2:00 p.m. If no Qualified
Bids are received by the Bid Deadline, then  the Auction will not be held,
Suburban will be deemed to be the successful  bidder, the Suburban Agreement
will constitute the Successful Bid (as  defined below), and at the hearing
held to request approval of the proposed  sale to Suburban, (the "Sale
Hearing"), the Debtor will seek approval of  and authority to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Suburban  Agreement.   (f) Only bidders
who have submitted a Qualified Bid ("Qualified  Bidders") will be eligible to
participate at the Auction. Only the  authorized representatives of each of
the Qualified Bidders, the Creditors\'  Committee Suburban, the Debtor, and
the Sellers shall be permitted to  attend the Auction.   (g) Bidding at the
Auction shall start at the purchase price stated in  the highest or otherwise
best Qualified Bid, as determined by the Debtor  and the Sellers, in
consultation with the Creditors\' Committee and as  announced to all
Qualified Bidders before the commencement of the Auction.  At the Auction,
Qualified Bidders may improve their bids in increments of  $1,000,000.00.
Suburban shall be entitled to bid-in all or any part of the  Termination
Payments at the Auction. Should overbidding occur, Suburban  shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to participate in the bidding  and to be
approved as the Successful Bidder (as defined below) at the Sale  Hearing
based on any such subsequent successful overbid. The bidding shall  be
continuous and competitive and shall not end until all bidders have 
submitted their last and best offers.   (h) At the conclusion of the
Auction, if any, the Debtor and the  Sellers will announce the highest or
best Qualified Bid (the "Successful  Bid").     4    (i) All Deposits
shall be held by Debtor\'s counsel in an  interest-bearing bank account
(assuming the bidder provides a Tax ID  number), with interest for the
account(s) of the bidder(s). Within two (2)  business days after the Auction,
Deposits (plus accrued interest, if any)  shall be returned to all bidders
except the bidder that submitted the  Successful Bid (the "Successful
Bidder"). The Successful Bidder\'s Deposit  shall be held until the closing
on the sale of the purchased assets and  applied (plus accrued interest, if
any) in accordance with the Successful  Bid.  THE FAILURE OF ANY BIDDER TO
COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS SHALL DISQUALIFY THE BIDDER FROM PARTICIPATION

above debtors and debtors in possession (the "Debtor") has filed a motion,
dated [November __, 2003] (the "Motion"), requesting orders (i) authorizing,
pursuant to sections 105(a), 363(b) and (f), 365(a), (c) and (f), and 1146(c)
of the Bankruptcy Code, Agway to conduct an auction sale (the "Auction") of

7   Agway\'s energy business, (ii) scheduling a date for the Auction,

conditions of the Auction, including bidding procedures, a break-up fee and

defaults under the Assigned Agreements to which you are a party (in each
instance, the    8   "Cure Amount"). Agway believes that there are no
non-monetary defaults (other than the filing of these chapter 11 cases) that
will not be cured by payment of the Cure Amount.   PLEASE TAKE FURTHER
NOTICE that Suburban\'s (or the successful bidder\'s) obligation to pay the
amounts arising under the Assigned Agreements after the closing constitutes

FURTHER NOTICE that any party seeking to (i) object to the Cure Amount as

any Assigned Agreements on any other basis, must file a written objection

claims or adjustments for percentage rent, real estate taxes, common area
maintenance, or similar adjustable charges (the "Unliquidated Charges") must
provide in such Assumption/Assignment Objection a good faith estimate (if
possible) of the amount of such Unliquidated Charges and a description of the
factors used in calculating such charges (in all cases with appropriate
documentation in support thereof). All Assumption/Assignment Objections must

Esq.), (collectively, the "Notice Parties").   PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE
that unless an Assumption/Assignment Objection is filed and served before the
Assumption/Assignment Objection Deadline, all parties shall (i) be forever
barred from asserting any cure or other amounts with respect to the Assigned
Agreements other than as set forth on Exhibit "A", and Agway and the
successful bidder shall be entitled to rely thereon; (ii) be deemed to have
consented to the assumption and assignment; and (iii) be forever barred and
estopped from asserting or claiming against Agway or the successful   
10   bidder that any additional amounts are due or other defaults exist,
that conditions to assumption and assignment must be satisfied under such
Assigned Agreements or that there is any objection or defense to the
assumption and assignment of such Assigned Agreements.   PLEASE TAKE
FURTHER NOTICE that hearings with respect to the Assumption/Assignment
Objections may be held (a) at the Sale Hearing, or (b) at such other date as
the Court may designate upon motion by Agway and the successful bidder
provided, that, if the subject Assigned Agreements are assumed and assigned,
the cure amount asserted by the objecting party (or such lower amount as may

Agway and held in a segregated account by Agway pending further order of the
Court or mutual agreement of the parties.   PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that
a properly filed and served Assumption/Assignment Objection shall reserve the
objecting party\'s rights only as to the assumption and assignment of the
Assigned Agreements, but shall not constitute an objection to the relief

to the relief requested in the Sale Motion must file and serve a separate
objection, stating with particularity such party\'s grounds for objection, so
as to be received by each of the Notice Parties listed above no later than
4:00 p.m. (EST) on December 15, 2003.   PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that if
you agree that there are no cure amounts due under your lease or contract,
and otherwise do not object to the     11   Agway\'s assumption and
assignment of your lease or contract, you need not take any further
action.   PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that the Agway\'s decision to assume
and assign to the successful bidder the Assigned Agreements is subject to
Court approval and consummation of the closing of the proposed sale
transaction. Accordingly, Agway shall be deemed to have assumed and assigned
each of the Assigned Agreements as of the date of, and effective only upon
the closing of the sale, and the successful bidder\'s decision to take
assignment of the Assigned Agreements. Absent such closing, each of the
Assigned Agreements shall not be deemed assumed nor assigned, and shall in
all respects be subject to further administration under the Bankruptcy Code.
The inclusion of any document on the list of Assigned Agreements shall not
constitute or be deemed to be a determination or admission by Agway or the

with Escrow Agent and this Escrow Agreement.   D. In order to establish the
escrow of funds and to effect the provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement,
the parties hereto have entered into this Escrow Agreement.   STATEMENT OF
AGREEMENT   NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
for themselves, their successors and assigns, hereby agree as follows:   1.

Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and, upon receipt by wire

Funds in the amount set forth on Schedule A hereto to Escrow Agent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to the account of the Escrow Agent
referenced on Schedule A hereto (the "Escrow Account"). Sellers shall be
deemed the owner of all Escrow Funds and investments in the Escrow Account
and shall be responsible for the preparation of all tax returns associated

upon request of Escrow Agent, with a Form W-8 or W-9 to evidence Sellers is
not subject to any back-up withholding under the United States Internal
Revenue Code. Sellers shall report all income, if any, that is earned on, or
derived from, the Escrow Funds as its income, in the taxable year or years in

paramount and prior in right of all other persons, upon all monies and other
property that shall have been received by it under this Agreement, to secure
the payment to it of fees and expenses hereunder due to Escrow Agent. Escrow

over any instrument, money or other property deposited with it in this
Agreement unless and until it shall have been paid and reimbursed its fees
and expenses.   4. Disbursement of Escrow Funds. Each of Sellers and
Purchaser covenant and agree to execute and deliver a Joint Written Direction
to the Escrow Agent at such time as the Escrow Funds are to be released in
accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. If Escrow Agent
receives Joint Written Direction to the effect that (i) the Asset Purchase
Agreement has been terminated, or (ii) the transactions contemplated by the
Asset Purchase Agreement have been consummated, then within three (3)
Business Days after the receipt of the Joint Written Direction, Escrow Agent
shall (1) disburse to Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be, and by the
method specified in the Joint Written Direction, out of the Escrow Funds, the

the Joint Written Direction exceeds the amount of the Escrow Funds, the
amount of the Escrow Funds), and (2) deliver written confirmation to Sellers
and Purchaser that such disbursement has been made.   5. Suspension of
Performance; Disbursement Into Court. If, at any time, (i) there shall exist
any dispute between Seller, Purchaser or the Representatives with respect to
the holding or disposition of all or any portion of the Escrow Funds or any
other obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder, (ii) Escrow Agent is unable to
determine, to Escrow Agent\'s sole satisfaction, the proper disposition of
all or any portion of the Escrow Funds or Escrow Agent\'s proper actions
with respect to its obligations hereunder, including, without limitation,
arising from adverse or conflicting claims made to any portion of the Escrow
Funds or (iii) the Representatives have not within thirty (30) days of the
furnishing by Escrow Agent of a notice of resignation pursuant to Section 7
hereof, appointed a successor Escrow Agent to act hereunder, then Escrow
Agent may, in its sole discretion, take either or both of the following
actions:   a. suspend the performance of any of its obligations (including
without limitation any disbursement obligations) under this Escrow Agreement
until such dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction
of Escrow Agent or until a successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed
(as the case may be).   b. petition (by means of an interpleader action or
any other appropriate method) any court of competent jurisdiction in any
venue convenient to Escrow Agent, for instructions with respect to such
dispute or uncertainty, and to the extent required or permitted by law, pay
into such court, for holding and disposition in accordance with the
instructions of such court, all Escrow Funds, after deduction and payment to
Escrow Agent of all fees and expenses (including court costs and attorneys\'
fees) payable to,     3   incurred by, or expected to be incurred by
Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and the
exercise of its rights hereunder. In the event such suit is brought, Seller
and Purchaser shall jointly and severally agree to pay Escrow Agent in excess
of the Escrow Funds deducted or paid to Escrow Agent, all costs, expenses and
attorneys\' fees that it may expend or incur in such interpleader suit, the
amount thereof to be fixed and a judgment therefore to be rendered by the
court in such suit.   Escrow Agent shall have no liability to Seller,
Purchaser, their respective shareholders, partners or members or any other
person with respect to any such suspension of performance or disbursement
into court, specifically including any liability or claimed liability that
may arise, or be alleged to have arisen, out of or as a result of any delay
in the disbursement of the Escrow Funds or any delay in or with respect to
any other action required or requested of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may obey
and comply with any order or process of a court (whether or not such court
shall have jurisdiction) commanding it to do or to refrain from some act in
relation to the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement. Escrow Agent may
rely and continue to rely conclusively upon such orders or process,
notwithstanding it may be found subsequently to be void or voidable, until
one of the officers of Escrow Agent, shall have actual knowledge that such
order or process shall have been modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or
quashed.   6. Investment of Funds. The Escrow Agent is herein directed and
instructed to initially invest and reinvest the Escrow Funds in the
investment indicated on Schedule A hereto. Escrow Agent may make any
investments through its or an affiliate\'s bond or investment department, for
which Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may serve as investment advisor
and receive compensation with respect to any investment direction hereunder.
The Escrow Agent shall provide to Purchaser and Seller a statement, on a
monthly basis, reporting the current balance of the Escrow Funds and the
amount of the investment earnings or losses. With the execution of this
Escrow Agreement, Seller and Purchaser acknowledge receipt of prospectuses
and/or disclosure materials associated with the investment vehicle, either
through means of hardcopy or via access to the website associated with the
investment selected by Seller and Purchaser. The parties hereto acknowledge
that they have discussed the investment and are in agreement as to the
selected investment. The Seller and Purchaser may provide instructions
changing the investment of the Escrow Funds (subject to applicable minimum
investment requirements) by the furnishing of a Joint Written
Direction, specifying the type and identity of the investments to be
purchased and/or sold, any particular settlement procedures required, if any
(which settlement procedures shall be consistent with industry standards and
practices), and such other information as Escrow Agent may require to the
Escrow Agent, and Escrow Agent may make or cause to be made such investments
subject to such additional terms and conditions as Escrow Agent may determine
appropriate under the circumstances; provided, however, that no investment or
reinvestment may be made except in the following:     4    a. direct
obligations of the United States of America or obligations the principal of
and the interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United State
of America;   b. certificates of deposit issued by any bank, bank and trust
company, or national banking association (including Escrow Agent and its
affiliates), which certificates of deposit are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or a similar governmental agency;   c. repurchase
agreements with any bank, trust company, or national banking association
(including Escrow Agent and its affiliates); or   d. any institutional money
market fund offered by Escrow Agent, including any institutional money market
fund managed by Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates.   If Escrow Agent
has not received a Joint Written Direction at any time that an investment
decision must be made, Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Funds, or such
portion thereof as to which no Joint Written Direction has been received, in
investments described in clause (d) above. Each of the foregoing investments
shall be made in the name of Escrow Agent. No investment shall be made in any
instrument or security that has a maturity of greater than six (6) months.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Escrow Agent may,
without notice to the Representatives, sell or liquidate any of the foregoing
investments at any time if the proceeds thereof are required for
any disbursement of Escrow Funds permitted or required hereunder. All
investment earnings shall become part of the Escrow Funds and investment
losses shall be charged against the Escrow Funds when realized. Escrow Agent
shall not be liable or responsible for loss in the value of any investment
made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, or for any loss, cost or penalty
resulting from any sale or liquidation of the Escrow Funds. Escrow Agent may
use a broker-dealer of its own selection, including a broker-dealer owned by
or affiliated with Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates.   7. Resignation
of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from the
performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving ten (10) days prior
written notice to the Seller and Purchaser specifying a date when
such resignation shall take effect. Such resignation shall take effect upon
the earlier of: (i) the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent as provided
herein or (ii) thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice of resignation.
Upon any such notice of resignation, the Representatives jointly shall
appoint a successor Escrow Agent hereunder prior to the effective date of
such resignation. The retiring Escrow Agent shall transmit all records
pertaining to the Escrow Funds and shall pay all Escrow Funds and transfer
all investments to the successor Escrow Agent, after making copies of such
records as the retiring Escrow Agent deems advisable and after deduction and
payment to the retiring Escrow Agent of all reasonable fees and expenses
(including court costs and attorneys\' fees) payable to,    
5   incurred by, or expected to be incurred by the retiring Escrow Agent
in connection with the performance of its duties and the exercise of its
rights hereunder. After any retiring Escrow Agent\'s resignation, the
provisions of this Escrow Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under
this Escrow Agreement. Any corporation or association into which the Escrow
Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the escrow
business of the Escrow Agent\'s corporate trust line of business may be
transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without
further act.   8. Liability of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent undertakes to
perform only such duties as are expressly set forth herein and no duties
shall be implied or otherwise imposed upon or against Escrow Agent, and
Escrow Agent shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties
and obligations as are specifically set out in this Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent shall have no liability under and no duty to inquire as to the
provisions of any agreement other than this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith
except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
the Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary
cause of any loss to the Seller or Purchaser. Escrow Agent\'s sole
responsibility shall be for the safekeeping and disbursement of the Escrow
Funds in accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement. Escrow Agent
shall have no implied duties or obligations and shall not be charged with
knowledge or notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set forth
herein. Escrow Agent may rely upon any notice, instruction, request or other
instrument, not only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but
also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which
Escrow Agent shall believe to be genuine and to have been signed or presented
by the person or parties purporting to sign the same. In no event shall
Escrow Agent be liable for incidental, indirect, special, consequential
or punitive damages (including, but not limited to lost profits), even if
the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage
and regardless of the form of action. Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to
take any legal action or commence any proceeding in connection with the
Escrow Funds, any account in which Escrow Funds are deposited, this Escrow
Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or
defend any such legal action or proceeding. Escrow Agent may consult legal
counsel selected by it in the event of any dispute or question as to the
construction of any of the provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of
its duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute involving any party hereto,
and shall incur no liability and shall be fully indemnified from any
liability whatsoever in acting in accordance with the opinion or instruction
of such counsel. Seller and Purchaser, jointly and severally, shall promptly
pay, upon demand, the reasonable fees and expenses of any such counsel. As
between Seller and Purchaser, each shall be responsible for the payment of
fifty (50%) percent of such fees and expenses.     6    The Escrow
Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply with orders issued or
process entered by any court with respect to the Escrow Funds, without
determination by the Escrow Agent of such court\'s jurisdiction in
the matter. If any portion of the Escrow Funds is at any time attached,
garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be
stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or
decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any
part thereof, then and in any such event, the Escrow Agent is authorized, in
its sole discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ,
judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it is
binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action; and if the
Escrow Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it shall
not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person or entity
by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree
may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.  
9. Indemnification of Escrow Agent. From and at all times after the date
of this Escrow Agreement, Seller and Purchaser, jointly and severally, shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent and
affiliate of Escrow Agent (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against
any and all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, damages,
liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including
without limitation reasonable attorneys\' fees, costs and expenses) incurred
by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties from and after the date
hereof, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or arising
from or in any way relating to any claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding
(including any inquiry or investigation) by any person, including without
limitation Seller or Purchaser, whether threatened or initiated, asserting a
claim for any legal or equitable remedy against any person under any statute
or regulation, including, but not limited to, any federal or state securities
laws, or under any common law or equitable cause or otherwise, arising from
or in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, performance or
failure of performance of this Escrow Agreement or any transactions
contemplated herein, whether or not any such Indemnified Party is a party to
any such action, proceeding, suit or the target of any such inquiry or
investigation; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall have the
right to be indemnified hereunder for any liability which resulted from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party. Each
Indemnified Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to select and
employ separate counsel with respect to any action or claim brought or
asserted against it, and the reasonable fees of such counsel shall be paid
upon demand by the Seller and Purchaser jointly and severally.
The obligations of Seller and Purchaser under this Section 9 shall survive
any termination of this Escrow Agreement and the resignation or removal of
Escrow Agent. As between Seller and Purchaser, each shall be responsible for
the payment of fifty (50%) percent of such fees.     7    The parties
agree that neither the payment by Seller or Purchaser of any claim by Escrow
Agent for indemnification hereunder nor the disbursement of any amounts to
Escrow Agent from the Escrow Funds in respect of a claim by Escrow Agent for
indemnification shall impair, limit, modify, or affect, as between Seller and
Purchaser, the respective rights and obligations of Seller, on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other hand, under the Asset Purchase Agreement. The
parties further agree that as between the Seller and the Purchaser,
each shall be responsible for the payment of fifty (50%) percent of the
amount of indemnification sought by the Escrow Agent.   10. Fees and
Expenses of Escrow Agent. Seller and Purchaser shall compensate Escrow Agent
for its services hereunder in accordance with Schedule A attached hereto and,
in addition, shall reimburse Escrow Agent for all of its reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses, including attorneys\' fees, travel expenses, telephone and
facsimile transmission costs, postage (including express mail and overnight
delivery charges), copying charges and the like. The additional provisions
and information set forth on Schedule A are hereby incorporated by this
reference, and form a part of this Escrow Agreement. All of the compensation
and reimbursement obligations set forth in this Section 10 shall be payable
by Seller and Purchaser, jointly and severally, upon demand by Escrow Agent.
As between the Seller and the Purchaser, each shall be responsible for the
payment of fifty (50%) percent of such fees and costs. The obligations
of Seller and Purchaser under this Section 10 shall survive any termination
of this Escrow Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.
Seller and Purchaser shall promptly pay such compensation and reimbursement
amounts to Escrow Agent or any Indemnified Party upon receipt of an itemized
invoice.   11. Representations and Warranties; Legal Opinions. Each of
Seller and Purchaser respectively makes the following representations and

including without limitation the Asset Purchase Agreement, to which it is a
party or any of its property is subject.   (iv) The applicable persons
designated on Schedule A hereto have been duly appointed to act as its

than the parties hereto has, or shall have, any lien, claim or security
interest in the Escrow Funds or any part thereof. No financing statement

payable upon execution of  the escrow documents. In addition to the
foregoing, Seller and Purchaser  shall be charged: (i) $100 per investment

revisions, non-standard cash and/or  investment transactions, calculations,

Notice"). If the Escrow Agent and Recipient receive a Dispute Notice from
Depositor within ten (10) Business Days after the Escrow Agent\'s and

Escrow Agent shall disburse the Credit Balance Escrow Funds in accordance
with and upon the receipt of either (i) a Joint Written Direction or (ii) the
report of the Accounting Referee (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement)
setting forth its calculation of the Cash Settlement of Credit Balances.  
b. General Indemnity Escrow Funds.   (i) If the Losses for which Recipient
is entitled to indemnification  and payment from the General Indemnity Escrow
Fund pursuant to Sections  10.2 and 10.5(b) of the Asset Purchase Agreement
exceed the     4    De Minimis Amount set forth in Section 10.5(b)(i)
of the Asset Purchase  Agreement and in the aggregate exceed the Deductible
set forth in Section  10.5(b)(ii) of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Recipient
shall be entitled to  deliver to Depositor and Escrow Agent a written notice
of the amount of  such Losses inclusive of the Deductible (an "Indemnity Draw
Down Request").   (ii) By no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the tenth  (10th) Business Day following receipt by Depositor and Escrow
Agent of an  Indemnity Draw Down Request (as to such ten (10) - Business Day
period, the  "Indemnity Draw Down Request Period"), Depositor may notify
Escrow Agent  and Recipient in writing, in accordance with Section 14 hereof,
of  Depositor\'s objection to the Indemnity Draw Down Request, which notice 
shall state with specificity the grounds for such objection (an "Indemnity 
Draw Down Request Counternotice"). In the event Depositor does not object 
within the Indemnity Draw Down Request Period, Depositor shall be deemed to 
have waived Depositor\'s right to contest the Indemnity Draw Down Request, 
the dollar amount claimed by Recipient as set forth in the Indemnity Draw 
Down Request shall be deemed fixed for purposes of this Escrow Agreement, 
whereupon within three (3) Business Days after the expiration of the 
Indemnity Draw Down Request Period, Escrow Agent shall (A) disburse at the 
direction of Recipient by the method specified in the Indemnity Draw Down 
Request, out of the General Indemnity Escrow Funds, the dollar amount 
claimed in the Indemnity Draw Down Request (or, if the amount of the 
Indemnity Draw Down Request exceeds the remaining amount of the General 
Indemnity Escrow Funds, the remaining amount of the General Indemnity  Escrow
Funds) and (B) deliver written confirmation to Depositor and  Recipient that
such disbursement has been made. The sole bases for an  objection by
Depositor to an Indemnity Draw Down Request pursuant to this  Section
4(b)(ii) shall be that the Losses incurred by Recipient (A) did not  exceed
the De Minimis Amount, (B) in the aggregate did not exceed the  Deductible,
or (C) were not eligible for payment from the General Indemnity  Escrow Funds
pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement.   (iii) If an
Indemnity Draw Down Request Counternotice is properly  given with respect to
an Indemnity Draw Down Request within the Indemnity  Draw Down Request Period
that also provides that portions of the claims set  forth in the Indemnity
Draw Down Request are not disputed ("Undisputed  Indemnity Portions"), then
the dollar amount of the Undisputed Indemnity  Portions claimed by Recipient
as set forth in the Indemnity Draw Down  Request shall be deemed fixed for
purposes of this Escrow Agreement,  whereupon within three (3) Business Days
after the expiration of the  Indemnity Draw Down Request Period, Escrow Agent
shall disburse at the  direction of Recipient by the method specified in the
Indemnity Draw Down  Request, out of the General Indemnity Escrow Funds, the
dollar amount of  the Undisputed Indemnity Portions     5    claimed
in the Indemnity Draw Down Request, and shall give written  confirmation to
Depositor and Recipient that such disbursement has been  made.   (iv) If an
Indemnity Draw Down Request Counternotice is properly given  with respect to
a Indemnity Draw Down Request within the Indemnity Draw  Down Request Period,
subject to Section 4(b)(iii) of this Escrow Agreement  with respect to
Undisputed Indemnity Portions, Escrow Agent may refuse to  comply with any
demands made upon it with respect to the underlying claim  until it receives
(A) a Joint Written Direction that such claim has been  resolved by mutual
agreement or (B) a final binding arbitration decision as  contemplated by
Section 5 of this Escrow Agreement, and in doing so, Escrow  Agent shall not
incur any liability to any party or person interested in  the subject matter
of this Escrow Agreement. Escrow Agent may rely and  continue to rely
conclusively upon such arbitration decision or Joint  Written Direction,
notwithstanding that it may be found subsequently to be  void or voidable,
until one of the officers of Escrow Agent, shall have  actual knowledge that
such arbitration decision or Joint Written Direction  shall have been
modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or quashed.   (v) Within any
Indemnity Draw Down Request Period, Recipient may amend  any Indemnity Draw
Down Request and Depositor may amend any Indemnity Draw  Down Request
Counternotice, in each case by giving written notice to the  other party and
Escrow Agent.   (vi) By no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, ten
(10) Business  Days prior to the General Indemnity Escrow Termination Date,
Escrow Agent  shall notify Depositor and Recipient in writing (a "General
Indemnity  Escrow Notice") that it is prepared to disburse the remaining
amount of  General Indemnity Escrow Funds to Depositor. If Recipient objects
to the  disbursement of all or a portion of the General Indemnity Escrow
Funds, it  shall give written notice (a "General Indemnity Escrow Objection
Notice")  to Escrow Agent and Depositor not later than 5:00 p.m., New York
City time,  five (5) Business Days after receiving the General Indemnity
Escrow Notice  from Escrow Agent (as to such five (5)-Business Day period,

pending claims which  are indemnifiable under Sections 10.2 and 10.5(b)(iii)
of the Asset  Purchase Agreement and the amount of the General Indemnity
Escrow Funds to  be retained by Escrow Agent with respect thereto (the
"General Indemnity  Holdback").   (vii) If Escrow Agent receives a General
Indemnity Escrow Objection  Notice from Recipient within the General
Indemnity Escrow Objection Notice  Period, the General Indemnity Holdback
shall be retained by Escrow Agent  pending resolution thereof and within
three (3) Business Days after the  expiration     6    of the General
Indemnity Escrow Objection Notice Period, Escrow Agent shall  (A) disburse
from the General Indemnity Escrow Funds an amount equal to the  General
Indemnity Escrow Funds less the General Indemnity Holdback to  Depositor
pursuant to written instructions from Depositor and (B) give  written
confirmation to Depositor and Recipient that such disbursement has  been
made. Recipient shall thereafter make demand as set forth in Section  4(b)(i)
of this Escrow Agreement for disbursement of General Indemnity  Escrow Funds
from the General Indemnity Holdback for Losses incurred with  respect to such
pending claims, whereupon the rights and obligations of the  parties set
forth in Sections 4(b)(ii)-(v) of this Escrow Agreement shall  apply.  
(viii) If the Escrow Agent does not receive a General Indemnity Escrow 
Objection Notice from Recipient within the General Indemnity Escrow 
Objection Notice Period, Recipient shall be deemed to have waived 
Recipient\'s right to contest the General Indemnity Escrow Notice, the 
dollar amount of the General Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be deemed fixed 
for purposes of this Escrow Agreement, whereupon within three (3) Business 
Days after the expiration of the General Indemnity Escrow Objection Notice 
Period, Escrow Agent shall (A) disburse to Depositor the remaining amount  of
the General Indemnity Escrow Funds in accordance with the written  direction
provided by Depositor to Escrow Agent and (B) deliver written  confirmation
to Depositor and Recipient that such disbursement has been  made.   c. Tax

Amount set forth in  Section 10.5(b)(i) of the Asset Purchase Agreement and
in the aggregate  exceed the Deductible set forth in Section 10.5(b)(ii) of
the Asset  Purchase Agreement, Recipient shall be entitled to deliver to

inclusive of  the Deductible (a "Tax Draw Down Request").   (ii) By no

to the Tax Draw Down Request, which notice shall  state with specificity the
grounds for such objection (a "Tax Draw Down  Request Counternotice"). In the
event Depositor does not object within the  Tax Draw Down Request Period,
Depositor shall be deemed to have waived  Depositor\'s right to contest the
Tax Draw Down Request, the dollar amount  claimed by Recipient as set forth
in the Tax Draw Down Request shall be  deemed fixed for purposes of this
Escrow Agreement, whereupon within three  (3) Business Days     7   
after the expiration of the Tax Draw Down Request Period, Escrow Agent  shall
(A) disburse at the direction of Recipient by the method specified in  the
Tax Draw Down Request, out of the Tax Escrow Funds, the dollar amount 
claimed in the Tax Draw Down Request (or, if the amount of the Tax Draw  Down
Request exceeds the remaining amount of the Tax Escrow Funds, the  remaining
amount of the Tax Escrow Funds) and (B) deliver written  confirmation to
Depositor and Recipient that such disbursement has been  made.   (iii) If a
Tax Draw Down Request Counternotice is properly given with  respect to a Tax
Draw Down Request within the Tax Draw Down Request Period  that also provides
that portions of the claims set forth in the Tax Draw  Down Request are not
disputed ("Undisputed Tax Draw Portions"), then the  dollar amount of the

Agreement, whereupon within three (3) Business Days after  the expiration of
the Tax Draw Down Request Period, Escrow Agent shall (A)  disburse at the
direction of Recipient by the method specified in the Tax  Draw Down Request,
out of the Tax Escrow Funds, the dollar amount of the  Undisputed Tax Draw
Portions claimed in the Tax Draw Down Request, and (B)  deliver written
confirmation to Depositor and Recipient that such  disbursement has been
made.   (iv) If a Tax Draw Down Request Counternotice is properly given
with  respect to a Tax Draw Down Request within the Tax Draw Down Request
Period,  subject to Section 4(c)(iii) of this Escrow Agreement with respect
to  Undisputed Tax Draw Portions, Escrow Agent may refuse to comply with
any  demands made upon it with respect to the underlying claim until it
receives  (A) a Joint Written Direction that such claim has been resolved by
mutual  agreement or (B) a final binding arbitration decision as contemplated
by  Section 5 of this Escrow Agreement, and in doing so, Escrow Agent shall
not  incur any liability to any party or person interested in the subject
matter  of this Escrow Agreement. Escrow Agent may rely and continue to
rely  conclusively upon such arbitration decision or Joint Written
Direction,  notwithstanding that it may be found subsequently to be void or
voidable,  until one of the officers of Escrow Agent, shall have actual
knowledge that  such arbitration decision or Joint Written Direction shall
have been  modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or quashed.   (v) Within
any Tax Draw Down Request Period, Recipient may amend any  Tax Draw Down

Recipient hereto acknowledge receipt of prospectuses and/or
disclosure materials associated with the investment vehicle, either through

requirements) by the furnishing of a Joint Written Direction--specifying the
type and identity of the investments to be purchased and/or sold, any
particular settlement procedures required, if any (which settlement
procedures shall be consistent with industry standards and practices), and
such other information as Escrow Agent may require--to the Escrow Agent, and
Escrow Agent may make or cause to be made such investments subject to such

the United States of America or obligations  the principal of and the
interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed  by the United State of

company,  or national banking association (including Escrow Agent and its 
affiliates), which certificates of deposit are insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation or a similar governmental agency;   c.
repurchase agreements with any bank, trust company, or national  banking
association (including Escrow Agent and its affiliates); or   d. any
institutional money market fund offered by Escrow Agent,  including any
institutional money market fund managed by Escrow Agent or  any of its
affiliates.   If Escrow Agent has not received a Joint Written Direction at
any time that an investment decision must be made, Escrow Agent shall invest
the Escrow Funds, or such portion thereof as to which no Joint Written
Direction has been received, in investments described in clause (d) above.
Each of the foregoing investments shall be made in the name of Escrow Agent.
No investment shall be made in any instrument or security that has a maturity
of greater than six (6) months. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

proceeds thereof are required for any disbursement of Escrow Funds permitted
or required hereunder. All investment earnings shall become part of the
Escrow Funds and investment losses shall be charged against the Escrow Funds
when realized. Escrow Agent shall not be liable or responsible for loss in

or any of its affiliates.   8. Resignation of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may
resign and be discharged from the performance of its duties hereunder at any
time by giving ten (10) days prior written notice to the Depositor and
Recipient specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect. Such
resignation shall take effect upon the earlier of (i) the appointment of a
successor Escrow Agent as provided herein or (ii) thirty (30) days after
delivery of such notice of resignation. Upon any such notice of resignation,
the Representatives jointly shall appoint a successor Escrow Agent hereunder
prior to the effective date of such resignation. The retiring Escrow Agent
shall transmit all records pertaining to the Escrow Funds and shall pay all
Escrow Funds and transfer all investments to the successor Escrow Agent,
after making copies of such records as the retiring Escrow Agent deems
advisable and after deduction and payment to the retiring Escrow Agent of all
reasonable fees and expenses (including court costs and attorneys\' fees)
payable to, incurred by, or expected to be incurred by the retiring Escrow
Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and the exercise of
its rights hereunder. After any retiring Escrow Agent\'s resignation, the
provisions of this Escrow Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent
under this Escrow Agreement. Any corporation or association into which the
Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated,
or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the
escrow business of the Escrow Agent\'s corporate trust line of business may
be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without
further act.   9. Liability of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent undertakes to
perform only such duties as are expressly set forth herein and no duties
shall be implied or otherwise imposed upon or against Escrow Agent, and
Escrow Agent shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties
and obligations as are specifically set out in this Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent shall have no liability under and no duty to inquire as to the
provisions of any agreement, including, without limitation, the Asset
Purchase Agreement (except for those sections of the Asset Purchase Agreement
expressly referred to herein), other than this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith
except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
the Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary
cause of any loss to the Depositor or Recipient. Escrow Agent\'s sole
responsibility shall be for the safekeeping and disbursement of the Escrow
Funds in accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement. Escrow Agent
shall have no implied duties or obligations and shall not be charged with
knowledge or notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set forth
herein. Escrow Agent may rely upon any notice, instruction, request or other
instrument, not only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but
also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which
Escrow Agent shall believe to be genuine and to have been signed or    
13   presented by the person or parties purporting to sign the same. In no
event shall Escrow Agent be liable for incidental, indirect, special,
consequential or punitive damages (including, but not limited to lost
profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such
loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. Escrow Agent shall not
be obligated to take any legal action or commence any proceeding in
connection with the Escrow Funds, any account in which Escrow Funds are
deposited, this Escrow Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement, or to
appear in, prosecute or defend any such legal action or proceeding. Escrow
Agent may consult legal counsel selected by it in the event of any dispute or
question as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or of any
other agreement or of its duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute
involving any party hereto, and shall incur no liability and shall be fully
indemnified from any liability whatsoever in acting in accordance with the
opinion or instruction of such counsel. Depositor and Recipient, jointly and
severally, shall promptly pay, upon demand, the reasonable fees and expenses
of any such counsel. As between Depositor and Recipient, each shall be
responsible for the payment of fifty (50%) percent of such fees and
expenses.   The Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to
comply with orders issued or process entered by any court with respect to the
Escrow Funds, without determination by the Escrow Agent of such court\'s
jurisdiction in the matter. If any portion of the Escrow Funds is at any time
attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the
payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property
shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order,
judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such
property or any part thereof, then and in any such event, the Escrow Agent is
authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such
order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected
by it is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action; and if
the Escrow Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it
shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person or
entity by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or
decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or
vacated.   10. Indemnification of Escrow Agent. From and at all times after
the date of this Escrow Agreement, Depositor and Recipient, jointly and
severally, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee,
attorney, agent and affiliate of Escrow Agent (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") against any and all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses,
damages, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including without limitation reasonable attorneys\' fees, costs and
expenses) incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties from
and after the date hereof, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a
result of or arising from or in any way relating to any claim, demand, suit,
action or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) by any person,
including without limitation Depositor or Recipient,     14   whether
threatened or initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy
against any person under any statute or regulation, including, but
not limited to, any federal or state securities laws, or under any common law
or equitable cause or otherwise, arising from or in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, performance or failure of
performance of this Escrow Agreement or any transactions contemplated herein,
whether or not any such Indemnified Party is a party to any such action,
proceeding, suit or the target of any such inquiry or investigation;
provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall have the right to be
indemnified hereunder for any liability which resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party. Each Indemnified
Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to select and employ
separate counsel with respect to any action or claim brought or asserted
against it, and the reasonable fees of such counsel shall be paid upon demand
by the Depositor and Recipient jointly and severally. The obligations of
Depositor and Recipient under this Section 10 shall survive any termination
of this Escrow Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent. As
between Depositor and Recipient, each shall be responsible for the payment of
fifty (50%) percent of such fees.   The parties agree that neither the
payment by Depositor or Recipient of any claim by Escrow Agent for
indemnification hereunder nor the disbursement of any amounts to Escrow Agent
from the Escrow Funds in respect of a claim by Escrow Agent for
indemnification shall impair, limit, modify, or affect, as between Depositor
and Recipient, the respective rights and obligations of Depositor, on the one
hand, and Recipient, on the other hand, under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
The parties further agree that as between the Depositor and the Recipient,
each shall be responsible for the payment of fifty (50%) percent of the
amount of indemnification sought by the Escrow Agent.   11. Fees and
Expenses of Escrow Agent. Depositor and Recipient shall compensate Escrow
Agent for its services hereunder in accordance with Schedule A attached
hereto and, in addition, shall reimburse Escrow Agent for all of
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys\' fees, travel
expenses, telephone and facsimile transmission costs, postage (including
express mail and overnight delivery charges), copying charges and the like.
The additional provisions and information set forth on Schedule A are hereby
incorporated by this reference, and form a part of this Escrow Agreement. All
of the compensation and reimbursement obligations set forth in this Section
11 shall be payable by Depositor and Recipient, jointly and severally, upon
demand by Escrow Agent. As between the Depositor and the Recipient, each
shall be responsible for the payment of fifty (50%) percent of such fees and
costs. The obligations of Depositor and Recipient under this Section 11 shall
survive any termination of this Escrow Agreement and the resignation or
removal of Escrow Agent. Depositor and Recipient shall promptly pay such
compensation and reimbursement amounts to Escrow Agent or any Indemnified
Party upon receipt of an itemized invoice.     15    12.

(collectively, the "Restricted Parties"), and Suburban Propane, L.P., a

*************   WHEREAS, the Company, either directly or through its
subsidiaries, is in the business of the retail and wholesale marketing of
propane and propane and natural gas related appliances and services
including, but not limited to, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
services (the "Business"); and   WHEREAS, pursuant to an Asset Purchase
Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") dated [ ], 2003, by and among the
Restricted Parties and the Company, the Restricted Parties have agreed to the
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery to the Company of the
Purchased Assets (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement); and  
WHEREAS, the entry into this Agreement is integral to the
transactions contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement and the full
execution hereof is a condition precedent to Company\'s obligation to
consummate said transactions.   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the
premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:   1. Restrictive
Covenants. As an inducement for the Company to enter into the Asset Purchase
Agreement, each Restricted Party hereby covenants and agrees that, commencing
on the date hereof and continuing for a period of ten (10) years thereafter
(the "Restricted Period"), it shall not (without the prior written consent of
the Company), in any manner, directly or indirectly, whether as a
shareholder, joint venture party, partner, member, investor,
consultant, independent contractor or otherwise, alone, or in association
with or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation, or other business
organization:   (a) anywhere in the United States, engage or participate in
a Competing Business, or assist, advise or be connected with, or permit its
name to be used by a Competing Business or render services that compete with
the Business for, any person or entity that is engaged in a Competing
Business;       (b) take any action in connection with a Competing
Business which might divert from the Company or any of its affiliates any
opportunity which would be (at the time of such action) within the scope of
the Company\'s or any such affiliate\'s Business;   (c) solicit or attempt
to induce any person or entity who is or has been a customer of the Company
at any time during the Restricted Period, to purchase competing products or
services from any person or entity (other then the Company), or to cease
doing business with the Company;   (d) take any actions which are calculated
to persuade any person or entity who is a director, officer or agent of the
Company or any of its affiliates to terminate their association with the
Company or such affiliates;   (e) solicit or hire any person or entity who
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
affiliates to perform services for any entity other than the Company and its
affiliates; or   (f) attempt or threaten any of the foregoing.   As used
herein, a "Competing Business" shall mean a business which engages, in whole
or part, in a business substantially similar to the Business of
the Company.   2. Confidential Information. Each Restricted Party will not,
at any time, communicate or divulge to any person, firm or corporation,
either directly or indirectly, any non-public, confidential information
relating to the Business, trade secrets, customers, suppliers, products,
technology, equipment, know-how, or other affairs of the Company including
without limitation, business plans, price schedules and information,
financial information including margins, customer and employee lists, product
lists and catalogs, marketing plans and policies, methods and techniques of
operations and software programs.   3. Specific Remedies. Each Restricted
Party acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive covenants contained in
this Agreement impose a fair and reasonable constraint on it and are
reasonably required to protect the interests of the Company and each
Restricted Party acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach by it of
any provision of this Agreement will cause irreparable damage to the Company,
the exact amount of which will be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and
that remedies of law for any such breach or threatened breach will be
inadequate to compensate the Company. Accordingly, the Company shall be
entitled, in addition to any other rights or remedies existing in its favor
to obtain, without the necessity for any bond or other security or for
proving actual damages, specific performance or injunctive relief in order to
enforce, or prevent the breach of, any such provision.     2    4.
Independence, Severability and Non-Exclusivity. Each of the rights enumerated
in Sections 1 or 2 hereof and the remedies enumerated in Section 3 hereof
shall be independent of the others and shall be in addition to and not
in lieu of any other rights and remedies available to the Company at law or
in equity. If any of the covenants contained in Sections 1 or 2, or any part
of any of them, is hereafter construed or adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, the same shall not affect the remainder of the covenant or
covenants or rights or remedies that shall be given full effect without
regard to the invalid portions. Any covenant shall be interpreted in the
broadest sense that will allow enforceability, with court imposed
restrictions applied to the minimum extent necessary for enforceability.  
5. Miscellaneous.   (a) Successors. This Agreement and all rights of the
Parties hereunder shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
Parties or their heirs, successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the Restricted Party\'s duties and obligations under this
Agreement and any extension hereof are personal and, therefore, may not be
delegated. Any purported assignment of this Agreement by any Restricted Party
shall be null and void and of no effect   (b) Governing` Law and
Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed by
the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of laws. The Parties hereto irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction
of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of New York
or any other court having jurisdiction over the Bankruptcy Case (as defined
in the Asset Purchase Agreement); provided, however, that if the Bankruptcy
Case has closed, the Parties agree to unconditionally and irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commercial Division, Civil Branch of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and any
appellate court from any thereof, for the resolution of any such claim or
dispute.   (c) Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.   (d) Notices. All notices, requests,
demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been duly given if: (a) personally delivered, (b) sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, (c) sent by facsimile (with

H   TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT   THIS TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT
(this "Agreement") is entered into as of this ___ day of December, 2003, by
Agway, Inc., a Delaware corporation as debtor-in-possession ("Agway"), Agway
Energy Products, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Agway Energy
Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Agway Energy Services, PA, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (collectively, "Agway Energy Sellers", and together
with Agway, "Sellers"), and Suburban Propane, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership ("Buyer").   RECITALS   A. Pursuant to that certain Asset
Purchase Agreement dated November __, 2003, as amended, by and between the
Agway Energy Sellers and Buyer (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), the Agway
Energy Sellers have agreed to sell, and Buyer has agreed to purchase, certain
assets owned by the Agway Energy Sellers. Agway is the parent corporation of
the Agway Energy Sellers. Sellers and Buyer are sometimes referred to herein
as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties." Capitalized terms used herein
and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the
Asset Purchase Agreement.   B. In connection therewith, and as a condition
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement, Buyer and Sellers desire that Sellers provide Buyer with certain
transition services with respect to the operation of the Business, as more
fully set forth herein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises
and covenants set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Sellers and Buyer
agree as follows:   AGREEMENT   1. Transition Services.   1.1 From the
date hereof through June 30, 2004, Sellers shall provide, or cause one or
more of their affiliates to provide, to Buyer, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions hereof, all services now provided by Sellers in the way of
central support functions with respect to the Business, including, without
limitation, billing, payroll, accounts receivable collection and
cash application, accounts payable monitoring and payment, financial
reporting, inventory management, tax reporting, information systems, call
center, product supply, marketing, fleet services, purchasing, real estate,
environmental and safety and training services, employee benefit
administration, human resources, and such other functions as are necessary to
assist Buyer in the operation of the Business (collectively, the "Transition
Services"), in each case in the manner and at a      relative level of
service consistent in all material respects with Sellers\' normal business
practices with respect to the Business; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require
Sellers to favor Buyer over their own business operations.   1.2 It is the
intention and agreement of the Buyer and Sellers that Buyer\'s use of any
Transition Service shall not be greater than the level of use required by
Sellers for the Business prior to the acquisition of the Purchased Assets by
Buyer. In no event will Buyer be entitled to any new service or to increase
its use of any of the Transition Services above that level of use without the
prior written consent of Seller.   2. Payment for Transition Services.  
2.1 Reimbursement. As reimbursement for the Transition Services, Buyer
will pay or reimburse the Sellers for those expenses set forth on Schedule A
hereto which are actually incurred or paid by the Sellers in connection with
their provision of the Transition Services, plus __%, in all cases upon
presentation of reasonably detailed expense statements and expense reports,
receipts, vouchers or such other supporting information as the Buyer
reasonably and customarily may require ("Back-Up").   2.2 Invoices. Within
thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month, Sellers will submit
one invoice to Buyer for all Transition Services provided to Buyer during
such calendar month pursuant to this Agreement, together with copies of the
Back-Up.   2.3 Time of Payment. Buyer will pay all amounts due pursuant to
this Agreement within ten (10) business days after receipt of each invoice
and applicable Back-Up hereunder, provided that in the event that Buyer, in
good faith and upon reasonable grounds, questions any cost or expense,
payment of that cost or expense may be made only after resolution of such
question.   3. Termination. Sellers shall have no obligation to provide any
Transition Services to Buyer after June 30, 2004, nor shall Buyer be required
to reimburse Sellers for any services provided or costs and expenses incurred
after June 30, 2004, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both parties.
Commencing on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date hereof, and
continuing every thirty (30) days thereafter during the term hereof, Buyer
shall provide Sellers with a written notice of those Transition Services
which it no longer desires be provided by Sellers (the "30 Day Notice"). The
Sellers shall cease to provide any Transition Service set forth in the 30 Day
Notice on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date the 30 Day Notice is
provided; provided, however, if a Transition Service to be so eliminated
cannot be eliminated within such thirty (30) day period because Sellers are
contractually obligated to use a third party\'s services to provide such
Transitions Service (a "Third Party Agreement"), Sellers\' shall continue to
provide such Transition Service, and Buyer\'s shall continue to be obligated
to    2   compensate Sellers for their provision of such Transition
Service until the first to occur of (i) the ninetieth (90th) day following
the date the 30 Day Notice is provided, (ii) the termination of the Third
Party Agreement, or (ii) June 30, 2004. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that as Transition Services are eliminated pursuant to this Section 3, the
invoiced costs will reflect a decrease in the fees and expenses set forth on
Schedule A.   4. Personnel. Unless a particular individual is designated on
Schedule A or is otherwise agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Sellers,
Sellers will have the right, in their sole discretion, to designate which
personnel they will assign to perform the Transition Services. Sellers also
will have the right, in their sole discretion, to remove and replace any such
personnel at any time or designate a third-party provider; provided, however,
that Sellers will use their best efforts to limit the disruption to Buyer in
the transition of the Transition Services to different personnel or a third
party, and any delegation of Transition Services to a third party provider
not engaged by Sellers on the Closing Date will require prior written
approval of Buyer. Sellers will pay for all personnel expenses, including,
without limitation, wages, of their employees performing the Transition
Services. Buyer will cooperate with Sellers\' reasonable request for
assistance and information in providing the Transition Services contemplated
hereunder.   5. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by either
Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, and any attempted
assignment shall be null and void.   6. Confidentiality. Except as may be
necessary to perform the Transition Services, each Party hereto shall, and
shall cause each of its affiliates and each of their officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns to hold all
information relating to the business of the other Party disclosed to it by
reason of this Agreement confidential and will not disclose any of such
information to any party unless legally compelled to disclose such
information; provided, however, that to the extent that either Party may
become so legally compelled such Party may only disclose such information if
it shall first have used reasonable efforts to, and, if practicable, shall
have afforded the other Party the opportunity to obtain, an appropriate
protective order or other satisfactory assurance of confidential treatment
for the information required to be so disclosed.   7. Representations and
Warranties: Indemnification Relationship of Parties.   7.1 Representations
and Warranties. Sellers agree to use their reasonable best efforts to provide
the Transition Services at a level and quality consistent with the provision
and performance of the Transition Services by Sellers to the Business prior
to the Closing.     3    7.2 Indemnification.   (a) Except insofar as
the same relate to Sellers\' breach of this Agreement or Sellers\' bad faith
or intentional misconduct, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Sellers, their subsidiaries and affiliates, and their directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Party") from and against any liability, cost, damage, expense or loss
(including court costs and reasonable attorneys\' fees) which the Seller
Indemnified Party may sustain or incur by reason of any claim, demand, suit
or recovery by any person or entity resulting from acts or
omissions committed by Sellers in providing the Transition Services pursuant
to instructions from Buyer with respect to such Transition Services.   (b)
Except insofar as the same relate to Buyer\'s breach of this Agreement or
Buyer\'s bad faith or intentional misconduct, Sellers shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the
"Buyer Indemnified Party") from and against any liability, cost, damage,
expense or loss (including court costs and reasonable attorneys\' fees) which
the Buyer Indemnified Party may sustain or incur by reason of any claim,
demand, suit or recovery by any person or entity resulting from Sellers\'
negligence, bad faith, or intentional misconduct in providing the Transition
Services.   7.3 Relationship of the Parties. Sellers shall and will remain
at all times independent contractors of Buyer in the performance of all
Transition Services hereunder. In all matters relating to this Agreement,
each Party hereto will be solely responsible for the acts of its employees
and agents, and employees or agents of one Party shall not be considered
employees or agents of the other Party. Except as otherwise provided herein,
no Party will have any right, power or authority to create any obligation,
express or implied, on behalf of any other party nor shall either Party act
or represent or hold itself out as having authority to act as an agent or
partner of the other Party, or in any way bind or commit the other Party to
any obligations. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create or
constitute a joint venture, partnership, agency, trust or other association
of any kind between the parties or persons referred to herein.   8.
Compliance with Laws. Each Party will comply with all applicable laws, rules,
ordinances and regulations of any governmental entity or regulatory agency
governing the Transition Services to be provided hereunder. No Party
will take any action in violation of any applicable law, rule, ordinance
or regulation that could result in liability being imposed on the other
Party.   9. Procurement of Insurance. Buyer agrees to procure and maintain
during the term of this Agreement, at Buyer\'s own cost and expense,
insurance as set forth below. Buyer agrees, however, that the procurement and
maintenance of such insurance coverage shall not limit or affect any
liability which Buyer may have by virtue of this     4   Agreement.
Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall provide
Sellers with a certification of insurance evidencing the required coverage
which certificate of insurance shall name Sellers as an additional insured.
In addition, Buyer shall not, during the term of this Agreement cancel or
make any change in the insurance coverage required under this
Agreement without Sellers\' prior approval.   The insurance to be carried
by Buyer pursuant to this section shall, at all times meet the following
minimum standards: (1) Workers Compensation in compliance with all applicable
state and federal laws, rules, and regulations at all sites where any of the
Transition Services are provided; (2) Commercial General Liability insurance,
including contractual liability insuring Buyer\'s obligations hereunder,
including, but not limited to, the indemnity agreement set forth in this
Agreement with limits of not less than $10,000,000 applicable to bodily
injury, sickness or death or damage to property in any one occurrence and
$10,000,000 in the aggregate; and (3) Automobile Liability Insurance
with limits of not less than $10,000,000 applicable to bodily injury,
sickness or death or damage to property in any one occurrence.   The
Sellers shall be specifically named by endorsement as an additional insured
on Buyer\'s primary auto liability policy and on Buyer\'s lead
umbrella liability policy and such other umbrella liability policies as are
necessary to obtain minimum limits of $10,000,000. The endorsements shall
specifically stipulate that the coverage extended to Sellers are primary, and
not contributory, with respect to any similar insurance that Sellers may
have.   Buyer hereby waives all subrogation rights against Sellers for any
and all loss or damage covered by Buyer\'s insurance. Buyer\'s insurance
policies, including, without limitation, auto liability, general liability
and worker\'s compensation, shall contain in substance the following
endorsement:   "This insurance shall not be invalidated if, prior to a loss,
the insured  waives in writing any or all right of recovery against any party
for loss."   Buyer and all parties claiming under Buyer hereby waive and
shall not make any claims against or seek to recover from Sellers any loss or
damage covered by insurance, regardless of whether the loss or damage is due
to the carelessness or negligence of Sellers, their servants, agents and/or
employees.   10. General.   10.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State
of Delaware.     5    10.2 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement
inures to the benefit of, and is binding upon, the successors and permitted
assigns of the Parties hereto. Neither Party may assign its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the express written consent of the
other Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that
Sellers may delegate their duties hereunder to such third parties as may be
qualified to provide the Transition Services.   10.3 Entire Agreement;
Amendments. This Agreement, together with Schedule A hereto, contains the
entire understanding of the Parties with regard to the subject matter
contained herein, and supersede all prior agreements or understandings
between Buyer and Sellers with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. This Agreement will not be amended, modified or
supplemented except by a written instrument signed by an authorized
representative of each of the Parties.   10.4 Force Majeure. Neither party
will be deemed in default if delayed or prevented from performing its
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, due to an act of God,
fire, flood, explosion, civil disorder, strike, lockout or other labor
trouble, material shortages of utilities, equipment, materials or facilities,
delay in transportation, breakdown or accident, riot, war, or other cause
beyond its control (a "Force Majeure Event"); provided that it shall resume
full performance of this Agreement as soon as practicable following the
conclusion of the Force Majeure Event.   10.5 Interpretation; No Strict
Construction. Article titles and headings to Sections herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The language used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties
hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any Party hereto.   10.6 Partial Invalidity. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of the provisions of this Agreement, will in no way be effected, impaired or
invalidated, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such
provision will be restricted in applicability or reformed to the minimum
extent required for such provision to be enforceable.   10.7 No Third Party
Beneficiary. This Agreement will not confer any rights or remedies on any
person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.   10.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other parties.    
6    10.9 Notices. Wherever under this Agreement one Party is required
or permitted to give written notice to the other, such notice will be deemed
given if made in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase
Agreement.   10.10 Nonwaiver. No alleged waiver, modification or amendment
to this Agreement shall be effective against either Party hereto, unless in
writing, signed by the Party against which such waiver, modification or
amendment is asserted, and referring specifically to the provision hereof
alleged to be waived, modified or amended. The failure or delay of either
Party to insist upon the other Party\'s strict performance of the provisions
in this Agreement or to exercise in any respect any right, power, privilege,
or remedy provided for under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver or
relinquishment thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, power, privilege, or remedy preclude other or further exercise
thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power, privilege, or remedy;
provided, however, that the obligations and duties of either Party with
respect to the performance of any term or condition in this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have
caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives
as of the date and year first set forth above.   AGWAY, INC., as debtor-in-

Gerling, Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge         MEMORANDUM-DECISION,
FINDINGS OF FACT,  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER     Presently before the
Court is a motion ("Compensation Motion") filed on March 10, 2003, on behalf
of Agway, Inc. ("Agway") and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries,
as debtors and debtors in possession (collectively, the "Debtors") seeking an
order approving certain modifications to Agway\'s employee compensation
programs pursuant to ss.ss. 363(b), 363(c) and 105(a) of the United States
Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. ss.ss. 101-1330 ("Code"). A Statement of Position
("Committee\'s Statement") of the Official Unsecured Creditors\' Committee
("Committee") was also filed on March 10, 2003, expressing support for the
Compensation Motion "with some degree of reluctance, but with the
knowledge that this issue had to be laid to rest for this case to move
ahead."(1) On March 21, 2003, a response was filed on behalf of General
Electric Capital Corporation, as Agent for certain pre- and post-petition
lenders, indicating that in its opinion the Compensation Motion "is fair and
reasonable in light of the circumstances." Opposition to the Compensation
Motion was filed on March 21, 2003, on behalf of what is referred to as an
"unofficial unsecured creditors\' committee" comprised of Agway
retirees   ----------   1 On October 22, 2002, the Court heard oral
argument on the Committee\'s motion ("Reconsideration Motion") seeking
reconsideration of certain first day orders, including one authorizing the
Debtors to pay prepetition wages, compensation, and employee benefits,
including "special incentive programs" in the approximate aggregate amount of
$4,800,000 and "paid time off\' obligations totaling $9,100,000. The
Committee sought information concerning, inter alia, "any bonus or incentive
programs, or any severance or pay to stay programs [to the extent they] are
assumed, approved or implemented." See P. 34 of Committee\'s Reconsideration
Motion. That aspect of the motion has been carried on the Court\'s calendar
along with Agway\'s motion now under consideration. According to the
Committee, "[t]he compromise embodied within the Compensation Motion resolves
all remaining issues raised by the motion for reconsideration."
See Committee\'s Statement at 5 n.1.     4  ("Retirees"), some of whom
allegedly ran the company for 30 years.(2) Agway filed a response to their
opposition on March 25, 2003.   The Compensation Motion was heard at the
Court\'s regular motion term in Utica, New York, on March 25, 2003. Following
oral argument, the Court adjourned the Compensation Motion to April 1, 2003,
in Syracuse, New York, in order for the Debtors to provide the Retirees with
additional information. The Retirees, having reviewed the materials provided
by Agway, submitted a Confidential Supplemental Affidavit to the Court on
March 31, 2003, expressing its continued opposition to the Compensation
Motion.   Following further oral argument on April 1, 2003, the Court
indicated that it would take the matter under advisement, affording the
parties an opportunity to file memoranda of law by April 15, 2003, with
particular focus on the statutory basis for the Compensation Motion.   
JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT    The Court has core jurisdiction over the
parties and subject matter of this contested matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
ss.ss. 1334(b), 157(a), (b)(1) and (b)(2)(A) and (M).    BACKGROUND   
The Debtors filed voluntary petitions pursuant to chapter 11 of the Code
on October 1,    ----------   2 According to the Debtors, although
there are approximately 5,100 such retirees, there are only an estimated 500
retirees that actually are creditors in the Debtors\' cases.   
5   2002. Agway is an agricultural cooperative engaged in a number of
business activities and it and its subsidiaries, to the extent they have not
been liquidated during the pendency of the case, have continued to operate
and manage their businesses as debtors in possession pursuant to Code ss.ss.
1107(a) and 1108.   Prepetition, Agway had in place various compensation
arrangements for its employees, including base salary, incentive
compensation, severance benefits, supplemental severance benefits for certain
key employees and special separation compensation arrangements for the most
senior executives. There were also allegedly retention and bonus plans for
employees of businesses that were expected to be discontinued or sold such as
the Agronomy and Seedway businesses, as well as Telmark.(3)   According to
Debtors\' counsel, following extensive negotiations with the Committee over a
five month period, the proposed compensation package presented to the Court
for its approval represents a downward modification from that which existed
at the time of the Debtors\' filing and is expected to result in an estimated
savings to Agway\'s estate of approximately $5.0-5.5 million.(4)
See Compensation Motion at P. 18 and Exhibit A(5), attached to Committee\'s
Position Statement.   ----------   3 The Agronomy and Seedway businesses
were sold postpetition to Growmark, Inc. upon approval by the Court on
November 13, 2002. The Court approved the sale of substantially all of
Telmark\'s assets to Wells Fargo Financial Leasing, Inc. on February 27,
2003.   4 The Committee points out that the savings of approximately $5.0 to
5.5 million "does not acknowledge the $5.5 million KERP (`key employee
retention plan\') payments originally sought by Agway and later dropped at
the Committee\'s insistence." See Committee\'s Position Statement at 9
n.5.   5 Exhibit A provides a comparison of costs under the original
proposed agreement and under the final agreement, as well as a summary of the
various payment terms under the proposed compensation agreement.   
6     The Committee describes a reduction in bonus arrangements for
"discontinued operations," which include the Agronomy and Seedway businesses.
The retention bonuses for certain employees of those businesses were reduced
by 20% and are now general unsecured claims. Fifty percent of the remaining
80% will be paid immediately in cash, after crediting $458,862 in payments
received before the petition date, "with the balance being `earned\' by the
employees based upon Agway\'s realization of the deferred balance of the
Growmark purchase price." Id. at P. 11. In addition, the Committee alleges
that it was able to negotiate a 20% reduction of the Telmark retention
bonuses, originally estimated at $1,744,756, and the capping of the pro rata
incentive compensation payment at $1,542,474, a decrease from $1,888,272 for
seventeen Telmark employees.(6)   According to the Committee, Agway had
wanted to keep base salary and incentive compensation arrangements in place
and also to provide for a substantial bonus or retention plan for fifty key
employees at an estimated cost of $5,428,000. The Committee objected to this
and also took issue with the payment of $545,819 in special bonuses paid to
seven employees in September 2002 on the eve of bankruptcy as a reward to
those employees who had assisted with "readying" Agway for the bankruptcy
filing.   Agway agreed, at the Committee\'s insistence, to drop the bonus
program and to make the "`incentive\' piece of Agway\'s traditional
preexisting compensation . . . more contingent upon performance than it had
been in the past."(7) Id. at P. 17. Also eliminated is the long term
incentive  ----------   6 According to Debtors\' counsel, employees of its
energy and leasing businesses, including Telmark, although nondebtors, agreed
to a reduced compensation package.   7 Under the current program, referred
to by Debtors as the "Management Target Annual Incentive Program," key
employees receive a straight salary component and an incentive     
7   plan payments to six members of senior management at an estimated
savings of $1,510,978.(8) With respect to the "bonuses" paid in September
2002 to seven employees, the Committee asserts that it insisted on the
recapture of these monies through an offset against the first incentive or
severance payments due. Accordingly, these payments will be deducted from the
amounts such employees would otherwise be entitled to for fiscal year 2003.
If the 2003 target incentive is not achieved and the employee is unable to
apply the September payment against the 2003 target incentive, it will be
deducted from the employee\'s 2004 target incentive payment.   At the
hearing on March 25, 2003, Guy A.Van Baalen, Esq., of the office of the
United States Trustee ("UST"), indicated that he too had concerns with
the application of the September payment to an employee\'s 2004 target
incentive. An agreement was reached with Agway and the Committee to further
modify the Compensation Motion. See Letter of Judy G.Z. Liu, Esq., of the law
firm of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, dated March 19, 2003. Under the
agreement, 50% of an employee\'s 2003 target incentive will be paid in July
2003. The remaining 50% will be paid on the earliest to occur of   (i) the
sale of the business unit for which the employee performs  services, (ii) the
involuntary termination of the employee, and (iii)  the confirmation of a
chapter 11 plan; provided, however, that solely  as to the employees of Agway
Energy, the date "December 26, 2003" will  be an additional event for
purposes of determining    ----------  component which is based on their
meeting certain performance targets as set for their respective divisions.
According to the Debtors, it is "designed with the objective of providing
total compensation to the employee at market levels if the target is met."
See Debtors\' Motion at 8. Furthermore, employees are entitled to receive all
or a portion of the target incentive if separated from Agway. Also certain
managers are eligible for continuation of employee benefits following
separation of employment.   8 It is unclear whether these savings include a
"change of control" payment to the president of Telmark of $230,022 which was
eliminated.     8    the earliest date upon which such employees\'
remaining FY `03 Target  Incentive will be paid.  See id.   The parties
also agreed that 75% of the "paid time off" obligations to employees for 2002
would be treated as a prepetition unsecured claim and 25% as a postpetition
claim. See Committee\'s Position Statement at P. 20.   The Committee
indicates that its support for the Compensation Motion "is dampened by its
recognition that Agway\'s preexisting compensation arrangements with its
employees were already quite generous and that Agway management\'s generosity
with itself may be an affront to general unsecured creditors. . . ." See
Committee\'s Position Statement at P. 6. Nevertheless, according
to Committee\'s counsel, the proposed compensation package represents a
delicate balance between overcompensation and not giving enough to the
employees to provide an incentive for remaining in the employment of the
Debtors postpetition. It was represented to the Court that if it turns out
that there is going to be a complete liquidation of the Debtors\' businesses,
it is essential that it be on a "going concern" basis so as to maximize value
for the unsecured creditors. The Committee notes that these reductions were
obtained without the cost of depositions and litigation involving, for
example, alleged fraudulent transfers of monies paid to certain employees in
September 2002, immediately prior to filing. It is also pointed out that
while a significant portion of the package consists of severance, it is hoped
that little of that will be paid out if the employees are retained in the
process of liquidation of any of the ongoing businesses.   With respect to
Agway\'s severance programs, there are three according to Michael R.    
9   Hopsicker, Agway\'s current Chief Executive Officer ("Hopsicker").
These include:   a. "Separation Compensation": covers four (4) current and
two (2)  former senior executives based on individual compensation
agreements  adopted annually in the first few months of Agway\'s fiscal
year.(9)   b. "Additional Retirement Benefit": the ARB program was adopted
by the  Board of Directors in February 2002, effective for separations on
and  after April 1, 2002. The ARB, which benefits all Agway employees, 
replaced Agway\'s Severance Pay program which also benefitted all  employees.
Program modifications adopted in February 2002 provide for  benefits to be
paid by Agway\'s over-funded pension plan, thereby  preserving Agway
cash.   c. "Supplemental Severance": memorialization in August 2002 of
long  standing practice of providing additional severance to certain 
executives and key employees upon involuntary termination without  cause.(10)
Historical payments have ranged from 50% to 200% of base  salary. The
Supplemental Severance Program that the Company is  proposing proposes
benefits ranging from 50% to 100% of base salary,  less ARB payments.  See
Affidavit of Hopsicker, sworn to April 1, 2003, at 3-4.   Agway\'s
Compensation Motion seeks Court approval of "a" and "c" above. Severance
payments for employees of continuing operations has been reduced and capped
at $6.4 million. See Committee Position Statement at P. 18. The
Committee explains that under the modification, it traded the certainty of
paying $5.5 million to key employees to stay for the probability that $6.4
million will never be paid because of the likelihood that key employees will
not be involuntarily terminated should a particular subsidiary be sold, as it
is reasonable to believe that the purchaser would wish to keep key employees
on in some capacity.  ----------   9 Agway\'s fiscal year ends on June
30th of each year.   10 This particular benefit allegedly applies to
approximately fifty individuals.    10    Finally, Agway\'s previous
CEO, Donald P. Cardarelli, who was terminated effective April 18, 2003, is to
receive a lump sum cash payment in the amount of $1,026,740 as his severance.
See Exhibit A, attached to Debtors\' Compensation Motion. According to the
Debtors, this represents 22 months of salary. See Debtor\'s Compensation
Motion at 12. He was not entitled to any annual incentive for the 2003 fiscal
year or any long-term incentive payment. See Exhibit A, attached to Debtors\'
Compensation Motion. It is alleged that this is less than half of what he was
originally entitled prior to the modifications. See Letter from Hopsicker,
dated March 7, 2003, attached as Exhibit C of Retirees\' Opposition, received
March 21, 2003.   At the hearing on March 25, 2003, the Court heard
arguments from the attorney for the Retirees. He argued that insufficient
information had been provided for there to be an informed decision about the
Compensation Motion. He raised questions with respect to when the various
compensation packages had been effected and whether they had been approved by
the Debtors\' Board of Directors. He also questioned why their approval could
not wait until plan confirmation. At the hearing on April 1, 2003, having
been provided with extensive documentation from the Debtors, he expressed
concerns about what he referred to as "corporate excess" over recent years at
a time when Agway was experiencing a downward turn in its gross revenues. He
asserted that between 1994 and 2000 management compensation had increased by
200% and that the "corporate culture" had changed and Agway had become "a
Wall Street compensation package firm" when it was merely "an agricultural
co-op in upstate New York."      11    DISCUSSION    Last year the
Employee Abuse Prevention Act of 2002 ("EAP Act") was introduced
unsuccessfully in Congress to "protect employees and retirees from corporate
practices that deprive them of their earnings and retirement savings when a
business files for bankruptcy . . . ." H.R. 5221, 107th Cong., 2d Sess.; S.
2798, 107th Cong., 2d Sess. (2002). Whether or not this proposed
legislation will again be considered in the current Congress is unknown.
However, in the wake of the national uproar over such mega filings as Enron
and WorldCom, the Court feels it necessary to approach any request concerning
severance packages and management stay bonuses prior to plan confirmation
with caution despite the lack of statutory guidance that the proposed EAP Act
otherwise might have provided.(11)   At the hearing on April 1, 2003, the
Court inquired about the statutory basis for Agway\'s  ----------   11
For example, the proposed EAP Act would have amended Code ss. 503 to require
that a transfer made to an insider of the debtor for the purpose of inducing
such person to remain with the debtor\'s business would not be allowed  
absent a finding by the court based on evidence in the record that (i) the 
transfer or obligation is essential to retention of the person because the 
individual has a bona fide job offer from another business at the same or 
greater rate of compensation; (ii) the services provided by the person are 
essential to the survival of the business . . . .  Furthermore, under the
EAP Act, Code ss. 503 would also have prevented a severance payment to an
insider of the debtor, unless   (i) the payment is part of a program that is
generally applicable to all  full-time employees; and (ii) the amount of the
payment is not greater than  10 times the amount of the mean severance pay
given to non-management  employees during the calendar year in which the
payment is made. . . .    12   motion and whether it was actually a
motion pursuant to Code ss. 365 seeking to assume certain prepetition
executory contracts or pursuant to Rule 9019 of the Federal Rules of
Bankruptcy Proceeding to approve a settlement of the Committee\'s
Reconsideration Motion. Agway\'s counsel had filed the motion in reliance on
Code ss. 363(b), ss. 363(c) and ss. 105(a). The Court asked that the parties
brief the issue and upon review of the memoranda of law submitted on behalf
of Agway and the Committee, it is clear that other bankruptcy courts asked to
approve key employees retention programs and severance packages, such as
proposed by these Debtors, have done so under the statutory umbrella of
Code ss. 363(b). See In re Aerovox, Inc., 269 B.R. 74, 80 (Bankr. D. Mass.
2001) (citations omitted); see generally, In re Dornier Aviation (North
America), Inc., 2002 WL 31999222 at *8 (Bankr. E.D. Va.) (noting that such
agreements do not fall within the category of agreements that are considered
"in the ordinary course of business" and require notice to creditors and
court approval, particularly when they involve executives or other key
employees, whether they be existing employment policies or new severance or
retention agreements). It is under that statutory umbrella that the Court
will consider Agway\'s Compensation Motion.   "The determination of whether
to approve such plans turns on the facts and circumstances of each particular
case." In re Montgomery Ward Holding Corp., 242 B.R. 147, 154 (D. Del. 1999)
(citations omitted). The Debtors\' business judgment, as applied to
discretionary actions or decisions of corporate directors, is to be given
considerable weight by this Court, sitting "as an overseer of the wisdom with
which the bankruptcy estate\'s property is being managed . . . and not, as it
does in other circumstances, as the arbiter of disputes between creditors and
the estate." Aerovox, 269 B.R. at 80, quoting In re Orion Pictures Corp., 4
F.3d 1095, 1099 (2d Cir. 1993).     13   As long as the Court finds the
compensation program fair and reasonable and the Debtors\' business decision
sound and not based on "bad faith, or whim or caprice," it should be
approved. See In re Logical Software, 66 B.R. 683, 686 (Bankr. D. Mass.
1986), remanded sub nom. Infosystems Technology, Inc. v. Logical Software,
Inc., 1987 WL 13806 (D. Mass. 1987) (citation omitted).   In this case, not
only does the Court have the request of the Debtors to approve the
compensation packages, it also has the Committee\'s statement of support for
the agreement which resulted from several months of negotiations with the
Debtors. What the Court does not have, however, is any evidence of approval
by the Debtors\' Board of Directors in the exercise of its business judgment.
The Retirees allude to approval by the Debtors\' Board of Directors on August
28, 2002. However, the compensation plan for which Court approval
is currently sought was negotiated by the Debtor and the Committee sometime
after October 15, 2002, when the Committee first requested reconsideration of
certain first day orders entered in the case.   In Aerovox the debtor
sought authority pursuant to Code ss. 363(b) and ss. 105(a) to implement a
key employee retention program consisting of a bonus plan for seventeen
middle management employees and a severance package for four executives. See
Aerovox, 269 B.R. at 75. The debtor\'s motion was opposed by the creditors\'
committee and an evidentiary hearing was held to determine whether to approve
the program in full, in part or not at all. The debtor and the committee were
able to reach a stipulation concerning the retention program for the
middle management employees; however, they were unable to reach agreement
concerning the severance package for the four senior executives. Id. Like the
Debtors herein, the goal of the debtor in Aerovox was to find a buyer for the
debtor\'s assets while maintaining the going concern     14   value of
the debtor.   The court in Aerovox, inter alia, heard the testimony of one
of the debtor\'s directors, who had served on its board for four years. Id.
at 78. He testified about the collective experience of the entire board of
directors, including five "outside directors." He testified that the board\'s
decision to approve the proposed compensation package was based on their
collective business judgment and went on to explain in detail the due
diligence conducted by the board in reaching its decision. Id. at 79.   The
matter now under consideration by this Court is to be distinguished from that
in Aerovox in that the Committee herein has agreed to the entire modified
compensation package presented by Agway allegedly in reliance on Agway\'s
business judgment. However, there is nothing in Agway\'s papers to indicate
that the proposed modifications received the prior acceptance and approval by
a majority of disinterested Board members. The Court also has no information
concerning whether any of the members of the Board are directly impacted by
the modifications. The Court also has no evidence of the due diligence
conducted in this regard. Agway and the Committee have indicated that the
proposed compensation package represents a downward modification of
that which existed at the time of the filing; nevertheless, the Court is left
without any basis for determining whether it is based upon sound business
judgment under the facts and circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the
Court deems it appropriate to schedule an evidentiary hearing at which
testimony may be presented by at least one member of Agway\'s Board of
Directors, who shall be subject to cross-examination, on the issue of sound
business     15   judgment as referenced above.(12)   Based on the
foregoing, it is hereby   ORDERED that an evidentiary hearing on Agway\'s
Compensation Motion shall be held on Wednesday, the 7th day of May 2003 at
9:00 a.m. at the U.S. Courthouse, 10 Broad Street, Utica, New York
13501.  Dated at Utica, New York   this 21st day of April 2003   /s/

International, LLC BANKRUPTCY CLERK  Case No. 02-65872 Chapter 11 Jointly
Administered UTICA, NY      LETTER DECISION AND ORDER    On April 21,
2003, in response to a motion ("Compensation Motion") filed on March 10,
2003, on behalf of Agway, Inc. ("Agway") and certain of its direct
and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors"), the Court issued a
Decision ordering an evidentiary hearing on the Compensation Motion to be
held on Wednesday, May 7, 2003.(1) In the alternative, Agway was
asked  ----------   1 Memorandum-Decision, Findings of Fact, Conclusions
of Law and Order, dated April 21, 2003.    2  to submit an affidavit
from a disinterested member of its Board of Directors setting forth the basis
for the Board\'s decision to approve the compensation package under
consideration by the Court. On May 2, 2003, the affidavit of Andrew Gilbert
("Gilbert"),(2) sworn to that date ("Gilbert Affidavit"), was filed with the
Court. As set forth in the Decision, the Court has received written
acceptance of the Gilbert Affidavit from counsel for the Official Unsecured
Creditors\' Committee ("Committee"), the United States Trustee ("UST") and
counsel for an unofficial committee comprised of Agway retiree
("Retirees"), making the evidentiary hearing unnecessary.(3)   As indicated
in its Decision, the Court had certain concerns regarding whether the
proposed compensation package had received approval by the Board of Directors
and the basis for the Board\'s approval. At the time, the Court had only the
recommendation of Agway\'s counsel and the Committee, as well as
a description of the compensation program by Agway\'s chief executive
officer ("CEO"), Michael R. Hopsicker ("Hopsicker").   The Court makes the
following findings based on a review of the Gilbert Affidavit:  1. Agway\'s
Board of Directors is comprised of ten outside directors who are  farm-
members of Agway.(4) None of the current directors have any financial  stake
in the   ----------   2 Gilbert indicates that he has been a member of
Agway\'s Board since 1995 and currently serves as vice chairman of the Board,
as well as chairman of the Board\'s Human Resources Management Committee. He
is a farmer member of Agway and operates a 1,087 acre dairy farm in Potsdam,
New York. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Cornell University and
is a graduate of Cornell\'s Agricultural Leadership Institute.   3 The
Court had given the parties, including the Retirees who had opposed the
Compensation Motion, an opportunity to have an evidentiary hearing in
order to cross-examine a disinterested member of Agway\'s Board of Directors.
No one opted to take advantage of that opportunity.   4 According to
Agway\'s "Board Manual", "[f]rom the 2002 Annual Meeting until the 2003
Annual Meeting, there are 13 member directors, two other directors and the
CEO. After the 2003 Annual Meeting, there are 12 member directors, two other
directors and the CEO." See Exhibit A at C-1, attached to Gilbert Affidavit.
There is no explanation given for the discrepancy between    3     
proposed modifications to the existing compensation and benefit programs 
which are being considered by the Court. See Gilbert Affidavit at P. 4. 
"Many of the Board members are, however, unsecured creditors of the company 
as a result of having invested in Agway securities, and/or as a result of 
having deferred the payment of their directors\' fees. The unsecured claims 
of these directors range from less than $10,000 to over $300,000." Id. at 
note 2.  2. Hopsicker, as CEO of Agway, is a member of the Board of
Directors. Except  for him, none of the other members of the Board are
employees of Agway. See  Exhibit A at C-1, attached to Gilbert
Affidavit.  3. Hopsicker is responsible for "implementing the policies
approved by the  Board and for reporting all aspects of Agway\'s operations
to the Board."  See Gilbert Affidavit at P. 7.  4. It is the Human
Resources Management Committee that has responsibility for  (a) evaluating
the performance of the CEO, and setting the CEO\'s annual  salary, incentive
plan and performance objectives; (b) reviewing the  compensation and
incentive plans established by the CEO for executive  management for each
fiscal year; authorizing any incentive payouts under  management incentive
plans for the prior fiscal year; and (d) authorizing  and amending major
employee benefit programs from time to time. See Gilbert  Affidavit at P.
8.  5. The Board reviewed and adopted or modified a series of compensation
and  benefit programs after consultation with the compensation and benefit 
consulting and design firm of Towers Perrin, attorneys at Weil, Gotshal and 
Manges, LLP and attorneys at Bond, Schoeneck and King, PLLC, for the purpose 
of striking "an appropriate balance between encouraging employees to stay  as
long as needed and avoiding needless expenditure of the company\'s cash." 
See Gilbert Affidavit at P. P. 10-11.  6. Under the compensation package for
which approval is being sought, there  are no new programs being added to
those in existence on the date the  bankruptcy cases were commenced. The
compromise, which was negotiated by  Hopsicker and the Committee, "affects
the payments to be made to the  employees under the existing programs but
does not change the programs  themselves. See Gilbert Affidavit at P.
14.  7. During the negotiation process, Agway\'s Board and the Human
Resources  Management Committee were provided with continual updates and
received a  requested analysis of the financial impact of the proposed
compensation  package.  ----------   Gilbert\'s statement that there are
10 member directors and the 12 or 13 set forth in the Board Manual.    
4   See Gilbert Affidavit at P. P. 15-16 and 19 (setting forth twelve
separate  occasions between October 25, 2002 and March 7, 2003 when the
compensation  and benefits programs and/or compromise were discussed).  8.
The Compensation Motion presently under consideration by this Court had the 
full knowledge and approval of the Board and the Human Resources Management 
Committee. See Gilbert Affidavit at P. 21.   According to Mr. Gilbert,  
[t]he Board and HR Committee were convinced, based on their review of 
independent compensation consultant reports, discussions with counsel  and
analysis of market data, that the various programs detailed  herein, and the
compromise reached with the Committee, provide an  array of incentives that
are calculated to enable Agway to retain its  valued employees and ensure
that they are compensated in a fair and  reasonable manner. Moreover, the
Board and Human Resources Management  Committee believed that by approving
the compromise, the likelihood of  preserving or enhancing the going concern
values for Agway\'s business  units will be maximized.  See Gilbert
Affidavit at P. 22.   Based on a review of the Gilbert Affidavit and
recognizing the weight that is to be given to the actions and decisions of
corporate directors, the Court finds that its concerns have been addressed
and concludes that it will grant the Compensation Motion as being in the best
business judgment of Agway.   IT IS SO ORDERED.  Dated at Utica, New
York  this 9th day of May 2003   /s/ Stephen D. Gerling

reasonable detail proposed Remediation activities ("Proposal"). Within ten
(10) business days of receipt of such notice, Sellers may notify Escrow Agent
and Purchaser, in accordance with paragraph 4 hereof, of its objection to the
Proposal. In the event Sellers do not object within such ten (10) business
day period, Sellers shall be deemed to have waived Sellers\' right to contest
the activities described in the Proposal. The sole basis for an objection by
Sellers to a Proposal shall be that the activities proposed therein are not
eligible for payment pursuant to the terms of the Asset
Purchase Agreement.   (B) To withdraw funds from the Escrow Fund, Purchaser
shall deliver to Escrow Agent and Sellers evidence of all Remediation Costs
incurred by Purchaser ("Remediation Costs Draw Down Request") together with
copies of all supporting invoices and other evidence of incurrence of such
costs ("Back Up"). By no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
tenth (10th) Business Day following receipt by Sellers and the Escrow Agent
of a Remediation Costs Draw Down Request (as to such ten (10)-Business Day
period, the "Remediation Costs Drawn Down Request Period"), Sellers may
notify Escrow Agent and Purchaser in writing, in accordance with Section 4
hereof, of Sellers\' objection to the Remediation Costs Draw Down Request,
which notice shall state with specificity the grounds for such objection (a
"Remediation Costs Drawn Down Counternotice"). In the event, Sellers do not
object within the Remediation Costs Draw Down Request Period, Sellers shall
be deemed to have waived Sellers\' right to contest the Remediation Costs
Draw Down Request and, the dollar amount claimed by Purchaser as set forth in
the Remediation Costs Draw Down Request shall be deemed fixed for purposes
of this Escrow Agreement, whereupon within three     5   (3) Business
Days after the expiration of the Remediation Costs Draw Down Request Period,
Escrow Agent shall (A) disburse at the direction of Purchaser by the method
specified in the Remediation Costs Draw Down Request, out of the Escrow

deliver written confirmation to Sellers and Purchaser that such
disbursement(s) has or have been made. Sellers shall not have the right to
object to the performance of any activities which were described in a
Proposal to which Sellers did not object pursuant to this section 2(e)(i)(B).
The sole bases for an objection by Sellers to a Remediation Costs Draw Down
Request pursuant to this section 2(e)(i)(B) shall be that (x) that the
activities for which costs were incurred were not included in an approved
Proposal and are not eligible for payment pursuant to the terms of the Asset
Purchase Agreement or (y) that the costs incurred were not reasonable at the
time such costs were incurred.   (C) If a Remediation Costs Draw Down
Counternotice is properly given with respect to a Remediation Costs Craw Down
Request within the Remediation Costs Draw Down Request Period that also
provides that portions of the Remediation Costs set forth in the Remediation
Costs Draw Dawn Request are not disputed ("Undisputed Remediation Costs
Portions"), the dollar amount of the Undisputed Remediation Costs Portions
claimed by Purchaser as set forth in the Remediation Costs Draw Down Request
shall be deemed fixed for purposes of this Escrow Agreement, whereupon within
three (3) Business Days after the expiration of the Remediation Costs Draw
Down Request Period, Escrow Agent shall (A) disburse at the    
6   direction of Purchaser by the method specified in the Remediation Costs
Draw Down Request, out of the Escrow Funds, the dollar amount of the
Undisputed Remediation Costs Portions claimed in the Remediation Costs Draw
Down Request, and (B) deliver written confirmation to Depositor and Recipient
that such disbursement has been made.   (D) If a Remediation Costs Draw
Down Counternotice is properly given with respect to a Remediation Costs Draw
Down Request within the Remediation Costs Draw Down Request Period, subject
to Section 2(e)(i)(C) of this Escrow Agreement with respect to Undisputed
Remediation Costs Portions, Escrow Agent may refuse to comply with any
demands made upon it with respect to the underlying Remediation Costs until
it receives (i) a Joint Written Direction that such dispute has been resolved
by mutual agreement or (ii) a final binding arbitration decision as
contemplated by Section 12 of this Escrow Agreement, and in doing so, Escrow
Agent shall not incur any liability to any party or person interested in the
subject matter of this Escrow Agreement. Escrow Agent may rely and continue
to rely conclusively upon such arbitration decision or Joint Written
Direction, notwithstanding that it may be found subsequently to be void or
voidable, until one of the officers of Escrow Agent, shall have
actual knowledge that such arbitration decision or Joint Written Direction
shall have been modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or quashed.   (E)
Within the Remediation Costs Draw Down Request Period, Purchaser may amend
any Remediation Costs Draw Down Request and Sellers may amend any
written notice to the other party and Escrow Agent.   (F) In the event
Purchaser submits a Remediation Costs Draw Down Request for Remediation Costs
incurred pursuant to an ISRA Remediation     7   Agreement, the parties
shall comply with the provisions of this section 2(e), except that, in the
absence of an objection by Sellers pursuant to section 2(e)(i)(C), Purchaser
shall be entitled to seek the release of the Remediation Costs Draw Down
Amount from the ISRA Financial Assurance Fund, or at Purchaser\'s option (or
if such funds cannot be obtained from the ISRA Financial Assurance Funds)
from the Escrow Fund.   (ii) Environmental Liabilities. (A) For all other
Environmental Liabilities for which Purchaser shall be entitled to payment
from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Purchaser
shall deliver to Escrow Agent and Sellers evidence of all costs incurred by
Purchaser as a result of such Environmental Liabilities ("Environmental
Liabilities Draw Down Request") together with copies of all Back Up. By no
later than 5:00 p.m. , New York City time, on the tenth (10th) Business Day
following receipt by Sellers and Escrow Agent of an Environmental Liabilities
Draw Down Request (as to such ten (10)-Business Day Period, the Environmental
Liabilities Draw Down Request Period"), Sellers may notify Escrow Agent and
Purchaser in writing in accordance with Section 4 hereof, of Sellers\'
objection to the Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request, which notice
shall state with specificity the grounds for such objection (an
"Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request Counternotice"). In the event
Sellers do not object within the Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request
Period, the dollar amount claimed by Recipient as set forth in
the Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request shall be deemed fixed for
purposes of this Escrow Agreement, whereupon within three (3) Business Days
after the expiration of the Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request
Period, Escrow Agent shall (A) disburse at the direction of Purchaser by the
method specified in the Environmental Liabilities     8   Draw Down
Request, out of the Escrow Funds, the dollar amount claimed in
the Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request (or, if the amount of the
Escrow Funds, exceeds the remaining amount of the Escrow Funds, the remaining
amount of the Escrow Funds), and (B) deliver written confirmation to Sellers
and Purchaser that such disbursement(s) has or have been made. The sole bases
for an objection by Sellers to an Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request
pursuant to this section 2(e)(ii)(A) shall be that (x) the costs incurred by
Purchaser were not eligible for payment from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the
terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement or (y) the costs incurred were
unreasonable at the time such costs were incurred.   (B) If an
Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request Counternotice is properly given
with respect to an Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request within the
Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request Period that also provides that
portions of the claims set forth in the Environmental Liabilities Draw
Down Request are not disputed ("Undisputed Environmental Liabilities
Portions"), then the dollar amount of the Undisputed Environmental
Liabilities Portions claimed by Purchaser as set forth in the Environmental
Liabilities Draw Down Request shall be deemed fixed for purposes of this
Escrow Agreement, whereupon within three (3) Business Days after the
expiration of the Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request Period, Escrow
Agent shall disburse at the direction of Purchaser by the method specified in
the Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request, out of the Escrow Funds, the
dollar amount of the Undisputed Environmental Liabilities Portions claimed in
the Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request, and shall give written
confirmation to Sellers and Purchaser that such disbursement(s) has or have
been made.     9    (C) If an Environmental Liabilities Draw Down
Request Counternotice is properly given with respect to an Environmental
Liabilities Draw Down Request within the Environmental Liabilities Draw Down
Request Period, subject to Section 2(e)(ii)(A) of this Escrow Agreement with
respect to Undisputed Environmental Liabilities Portions, Escrow Agent may
refuse to comply with any demands made upon it with respect to the underlying
claim until it receives (A) a Joint Written Direction that such claim has
been resolved by mutual agreement or (B) a final binding arbitration decision
as contemplated by Section 12 of this Escrow Agreement, and in doing so,
Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability to any party or person interested
in the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement. Escrow Agent may rely and
continue to rely conclusively upon such arbitration decision or Joint Written
Direction, notwithstanding that it may be found subsequently to be void or
voidable, until one of the officers of Escrow Agent, shall have actual
knowledge that such arbitration decision or Joint Written Direction shall
have been modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or quashed.   (D) Within
any Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request Period, Purchaser may amend
any Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request and Sellers may amend any
Environmental Liabilities Draw Down Request Counternotice, in each case by
giving written notice to the other party and Escrow Agent.   (iii) (A)
Release of Balance of Escrow. By no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Escrow Termination Date, Escrow Agent
shall notify Sellers and Purchaser in writing ("Escrow Notice") that it is
prepared to disburse the Escrow Funds to Sellers. If Purchaser objects to the
disbursement of all or a portion of the Escrow Funds, it shall give written
notice     10   ("Escrow Objection Notice") to Escrow Agent and Sellers
not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five (5)-Business Days after
the Escrow Notice from Escrow Agent (as to such five (5)-Business Day Period,
the "Escrow Objection Notice Period"). The Escrow Objection Notice shall
state whether there exists any pending Remediations or other claims for
Environmental Liabilities pending on the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, and the amount of the Escrow Funds to be retained by the Escrow Agent
with respect thereto which amounts shall, in the aggregate, equal the total
of the reasonably estimated amounts of such Remediations and other
Environmental Liabilities (or, if the reasonably estimated amounts of such
Remediations and other Environmental Liabilities exceeds the amount in the
Escrow Fund, the remaining amount of such funds) (the "Holdback").   (B) If
Escrow Agent receives an Escrow Objection Notice from Purchaser within the
Escrow Objection Notice Period, the Holdback shall be retained by Escrow
Agent pending, in the case of a Remediation, receipt by Purchaser of
a written determination from the Governmental Body with jurisdiction over
the Remediation that no further Remediation is required for Hazardous
Materials on, at, under or migrating from the property ("NFA") or, in the
case of other Environmental Liabilities, the resolution of such other
Environmental Liabilities. Within three (3) Business Days after the
expiration of the Escrow Objection Notice Period, Escrow Agent shall (A)
disburse the Escrow Funds less the Holdback to Sellers pursuant to written
instructions from Purchaser and (B) give written confirmation to Seller and
Purchaser that such disbursement(s) has or have been made. Purchaser shall
thereafter make demand as set forth in Section 2(e)(i) and (ii) of this
Escrow Agreement for disbursement     11   of Escrow Funds from the
Holdback for costs and Losses incurred with respect to such Remediations and
Environmental Liabilities, whereupon the rights and obligations of the
parties set forth in Sections 2(e)(ii)(A)-(D) of this Escrow Agreement shall
apply.   (C) If the Escrow Agent does not receive an Escrow Objection Notice
from Purchaser within the Escrow Objection Notice Period, Purchaser shall be
deemed to have waived Purchaser\'s right to contest the Escrow Notice, the
dollar amount of the Escrow Funds shall be deemed fixed for purposes of this
Escrow Agreement, whereupon within three (3) Business Days after the
expiration of the Escrow Objection Notice Period, Escrow Agent shall (A)
disburse at the direction of Sellers by the method specified in writing by
Sellers to Escrow Agent, the Escrow Funds, and (B) deliver written
confirmation to Sellers and Purchaser that such disbursement has been
made.   (iv) ISRA Financial Assurance Funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any ISRA Financial Assurance Funds shall remain on deposit, to the extent
not released pursuant to Section 2(e)(i) or (ii), until Purchaser receives an
NFA for the Remediation for which the ISRA Financial Assurance Fund was
established ("ISRA NFA"). In the event that Purchaser receives an ISRA NFA
prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, any remaining funds in
such ISRA Financial Assurance Fund shall be released to Escrow Agent and
Escrow Agent shall promptly deposit such funds into the Escrow Account. In
the event that Purchaser receives an ISRA NFA on or after the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, any remaining funds in the ISRA Financial
Assurance Fund, less any outstanding Remediation Costs of Purchaser, shall be
released to Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser obtains an
ISRA NFA on or after     12   the third anniversary of the Closing Date
and (i) there are pending Remediations or other claims for Environmental
Liabilities and (ii) the amount remaining in the Escrow Account is less than
the total of the reasonably estimated amounts of such pending Remediation and
other Environmental Liabilities, then any amounts remaining in the ISRA
Financial Assurance Fund shall be released to Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent
shall deposit the amount which is equal to the difference between the amount
remaining in the Escrow Account and the amount of the total of the reasonably
estimated amounts of such Remediation and other Environmental Liabilities
into the Escrow Account and Escrow Agent shall immediately release any
remaining funds, less any outstanding Remediation Costs incurred
by Purchaser, to Sellers.   (f) Investment of Funds. The Escrow Agent is
herein directed and instructed to initially invest and reinvest the Escrow
Funds in the investment indicated on Schedule A hereto. Escrow Agent may make
any investments through its or an affiliate\'s bond or investment department,
for which Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may serve as investment
advisor and receive compensation with respect to any investment direction
hereunder. With the execution of this Escrow Agreement, Sellers and Purchaser
hereto acknowledge receipt of prospectuses and/or disclosure materials
associated with the investment vehicle, either through means of hardcopy or
via access to the website associated with the investment selected by Sellers
and Purchaser. Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge that they have discussed the
investment and are in agreement as to the selected investment. The Purchaser
and Sellers may provide instructions changing the investment of the Escrow
Funds (subject to applicable minimum investment requirements) by the
furnishing of a Joint Written Direction specifying the type and    
13   identity of the investments to be purchased and/or sold, any
particular settlement procedures required, if any (which settlement
procedures shall be consistent with industry standards and practices), and
such other information as Escrow Agent may require to the Escrow Agent, and
Escrow Agent may make or cause to be made such investments subject to such
additional terms and conditions as Escrow Agent may determine appropriate
under the circumstances; provided, however, that no investment or
reinvestment may be made except in the following:   (i) direct obligations
of the United States of America or obligations the principal of and the
interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United State of
America;   (ii) certificates of deposit issued by any bank, bank and trust
company, or national banking association (including Escrow Agent and its
affiliates), which certificates of deposit are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or a similar governmental agency;   (iii) repurchase
agreements with any bank, trust company, or national banking association
(including Escrow Agent and its affiliates); or   (iv) any institutional
money market fund offered by Escrow Agent, including any institutional money
market fund managed by Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates.   If Escrow
Agent has not received a written direction from Purchaser and Sellers at any
time that an investment decision must be made, Escrow Agent shall invest the
Environmental Indemnity Escrow Funds, or such portion thereof as to which no
joint written direction has been received, in investments described in clause
(iv) above. Each     14   of the foregoing investments shall be made in
the name of Escrow Agent. No investment shall be made in any instrument or
security that has a maturity of greater than six (6) months. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Escrow Agent may, without notice
to the Purchaser and Sellers, sell or liquidate any of the foregoing
investments at any time if the proceeds thereof are required for any
disbursement of Escrow Funds permitted or required hereunder. All investment
earnings shall become part of the Escrow Funds and investment losses shall be
charged against the Escrow Funds when realized. Escrow Agent shall not be
liable or responsible for loss in the value of any investment made pursuant
to this Escrow Agreement, or for any loss, cost or penalty resulting from any
sale or liquidation of the Escrow Funds. Escrow Agent may use a broker-dealer
of its own selection, including a broker-dealer owned by or affiliated with
Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates.   (g) Resignation of Escrow Agent.
Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from the performance of its duties
hereunder at any time by giving ten (10) days prior written notice to the
Purchaser and Sellers specifying a date when such resignation shall take
effect. Such resignation shall take effect upon the earlier of: (i) the
appointment of a successor Escrow Agent as provided herein or (ii) thirty
(30) days after delivery of such notice of resignation. Upon any such notice
of resignation, the Purchaser and Sellers jointly shall appoint a successor
Escrow Agent hereunder prior to the effective date of such resignation. The
retiring Escrow Agent shall transmit all records pertaining to the Escrow
Funds and shall pay all Escrow Funds and transfer all investments to the
successor Escrow Agent, after making copies of such records as the    
15   retiring Escrow Agent deems advisable and after deduction and payment
to the retiring Escrow Agent of all reasonable fees and expenses (including
court costs and attorneys\' fees) payable to, incurred by, or expected to be
incurred by the retiring Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of
its duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder. After any retiring
Escrow Agent\'s resignation, the provisions of this Escrow Agreement shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement. Any corporation or
association into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all
or substantially all of the escrow business of the Escrow Agent\'s corporate
trust line of business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under
this Escrow Agreement without further act.   (h) Liability of Escrow Agent.
The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set
forth herein and no duties shall be implied, or otherwise imposed upon or
against Escrow Agent, and Escrow Agent shall not be liable except for the
performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set out in
this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability under and no
duty to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement, including, without
limitation, the Asset Purchase Agreement, other than this Escrow Agreement.
The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in
good faith except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct
was the primary cause of any loss to the Purchaser and Sellers. Escrow
Agent\'s sole responsibility shall be for the safekeeping and disbursement of
the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms of this Escrow
Agreement. Escrow Agent shall have     16   no implied duties or
obligations and shall not be charged with knowledge or notice of any fact or
circumstance not specifically set forth herein. Escrow Agent may rely upon
any notice, instruction, request or other instrument, not only as to its due
execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy
of any information contained therein, which Escrow Agent shall believe to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the person or parties
purporting to sign the same. In no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for
incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages
(including, but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has
been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the
form of action. Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal action
or commence any proceeding in connection with the Escrow Funds, any account
in which Escrow Funds are deposited, this Escrow Agreement or the Asset
Purchase Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or defend any such legal
action or proceeding. Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel selected by it
in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the
provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of its duties hereunder, or
relating to any dispute involving any party hereto, and shall incur no
liability and shall be fully indemnified from any liability whatsoever in
acting in accordance with the opinion or instruction of such counsel.
Purchaser and Sellers, jointly and severally, shall promptly pay, upon
demand, the reasonable fees and expenses of any such counsel. As between
Purchaser and Sellers, each shall be responsible for the payment of fifty
(50%) percent of such fees and expenses.   The Escrow Agent is authorized,
in its sole discretion, to comply with orders issued or process entered by
any court with respect to the Escrow Funds, without    
17   determination by the Escrow Agent of such court\'s jurisdiction in the
matter. If any portion of the Escrow Funds is at any time attached, garnished
or levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or
enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall
be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof,
then and in any such event, the Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole
discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or
decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it
without the need for appeal or other action; and if the Escrow Agent complies
with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any
of the parties hereto or to any other person or entity by reason of such
compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.   (i)
Indemnification of Escrow Agent. From and at all times after the date of this
Escrow Agreement, Purchaser and Sellers, jointly and severally, shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Escrow
Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent and affiliate of
Escrow Agent (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any and
all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, damages, liabilities,
costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys\' fees, costs and expenses) incurred by or
asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties from and after the date
hereof, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or arising
from or in any way relating to any claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding
(including any inquiry or    18   investigation) by any person,
including without limitation Purchaser and Sellers, whether threatened or
initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy against any
person under any statute or regulation, including, but not limited to, any
federal or state securities laws, or under any common law or equitable cause
or otherwise, arising from or in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, performance or failure of performance of this Escrow
Agreement or any transactions contemplated herein, whether or not any such
Indemnified Party is a party to any such action, proceeding, suit or the
target of any such inquiry or investigation; provided, however, that

of any claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification hereunder nor the

severally, upon demand by Escrow Agent. As between the Purchaser and Sellers,

removal of Escrow Agent. Purchaser and Sellers shall promptly pay such
compensation and reimbursement amounts to Escrow Agent or any Indemnified
Party upon receipt of an itemized invoice.   3. Indemnification; Limits of
Liability. Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold the Purchaser and

Suspension of Performance; Disbursement Into Court. If, at any time, (i)
Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to Escrow Agent\'s sole
satisfaction, the proper disposition of all or any portion of the Escrow
Funds or Escrow Agent\'s proper actions with respect to its obligations
hereunder, including, without limitation, arising from adverse or conflicting
claims made to any portion of the Escrow Funds, or (ii) the Purchasers and
Sellers have not within thirty (30) days of the furnishing by Escrow Agent of
a notice of resignation pursuant to Section 2(f) hereof, appointed a
successor Escrow Agent to act hereunder, then Escrow Agent may, in its sole
discretion, take either or both of the following actions:     24    a.
Suspend the performance of any of its obligations (including
without limitation any disbursement obligations) under this Escrow Agreement
until such uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction of Escrow
Agent or until a successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed (as the
case may be).   b. Petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other
appropriate method) any court of competent jurisdiction in any venue
convenient to Escrow Agent, for instructions with respect to such
uncertainty, and to the extent required or permitted by law, pay into such
court, for holding and disposition in accordance with the instructions of
such court, the Escrow Fund, after deduction and payment to Escrow Agent of
all fees and expenses (including court costs and attorneys\' fees) payable
to, incurred by, or expected to be incurred by Escrow Agent in connection
with the performance of its duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder.
In the event such suit is brought, Sellers and Purchaser shall jointly and
severally agree to pay Escrow Agent in excess of the Escrow Funds deducted or
paid to Escrow Agent, all costs, expenses and attorney\'s fees that it may
expend or incur in such interpleader suit, the amount thereof to be fixed and
a judgment therefore to be rendered by the court in such suit.   Escrow
Agent shall have no liability to Purchaser and Sellers and their respective
shareholders, partners or members or any other person with respect to any
such suspension of performance or disbursement into court,
specifically including any liability or claimed liability that may arise, or
be alleged to have arisen, out of or as a result of any delay in the
disbursement of the Escrow Fund or any delay in or with respect to any other
action required or requested of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may obey and
comply with     25   any order or process of a court (whether or not
such court shall have jurisdiction) commanding it to do or to refrain from
some act in relation to the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement. Escrow
Agent may rely and continue to rely conclusively upon such orders or process,
notwithstanding that it may be found subsequently to be void or voidable,
until one of the officers of Escrow Agent, shall have actual knowledge that
such order or process shall have been modified, annulled, set aside, vacated
or quashed.   18. Termination. Upon the disbursement of all amounts of the
Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 2 hereof or the disbursement of all of the
Escrow Fund into court pursuant to Section 2(g) or Section 17 hereof, this
Escrow Agreement shall terminate and Escrow Agent shall have no further
obligation or liability whatsoever with respect to this Escrow Agreement or
the Escrow Fund.   19. Dealings. The Escrow Agent and any stockholder,
director, officer or employee of the Escrow Agent may buy, sell, and deal in
any of the securities of the Purchaser or Sellers and become peculiarly
interested in any transaction in which the Purchaser or Sellers may be
interested, and contract and lend money to the Purchaser or Sellers and
otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Escrow Agent under
this Escrow Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Escrow Agent from
acting in any other capacity for the Purchaser or Sellers or for any other
entity.   20. Conflict. In the event of any ambiguity or inconsistency
between the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the terms hereof, the
terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement shall prevail.   [Remainder of Page
