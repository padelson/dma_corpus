     1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Washington Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Company (the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a

the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing an
agreement and plan of merger and articles, certificates or other appropriate

accordance with the relevant provisions of Washington Law (collectively, the
"Certificate of Merger") (the time of such filing (or such later time as may be
agreed in writing by Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of
Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date (as herein defined). Unless the context otherwise requires, the
term "Agreement" as used herein refers collectively to this Agreement and Plan
of Reorganization and the Certificate of Merger. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati,
Professional Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California at a time
and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the
second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI, or at such other time, date and location as the parties
hereto agree in writing (the "Closing Date").

     1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Washington Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers,
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.4 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.

     (a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the


                                      -2-
<PAGE>


Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that
at th Effective Time the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"HomeGrocer.com, Inc."

     (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended.

     1.5 Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers of
the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

     1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the
following securities, the following shall occur:

     (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock, no par
value per share, of Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company
Common Stock ("Shares") to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.6(g)), will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Sections 1.6(e) and (f))
into the right to receive that number of shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par
value per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") equal to 1.07605 (the
"Exchange Ratio"), upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of
Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7 (or in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond,
if required) in the manner provided in Section 1.9). If any shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested
or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement
with the Company, then, subject to the terms of the plan or agreement pursuant
to which such shares were issued, the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Company shall take all action
that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in
any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

     (b) Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.


                                      -3-
<PAGE>


     (c) Stock Options and Warrants. At the Effective Time, all options to
purchase Company Common Stock and stock appreciation rights then outstanding
under Company's 1997 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (the "1997 Plan"), 1999
Stock Incentive Plan (the "1999 Plan") and 1999 Directors' Stock Option Plan
(the "Directors Plan" and, together with the 1997 Plan and the 1999 Plan, the
"Company Option Plans"), each of the Company Option Plans and all warrants to
purchase Company Common Stock shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with
Section 5.8 hereof.

     (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Common Stock, no par value,
of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into or exercisable
for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, no
par value, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership
of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
or exercisable for Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

     (f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon
surrender of such holder's Certificates(s) (as defined in Section 1.7(c)),
receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the
average closing price of Parent Common Stock for the five trading days
immediately preceding the last full trading day prior to the Effective Time, as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market System ("Nasdaq").

     (g) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, the holder of
which has demanded and perfected such holder's right to dissent from the Merger
and to be paid the fair value of such shares by Company in accordance with
Sections 23B.13.010 et seq. of Washington Law ("Dissenting Shares") and, as of
the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters'
rights, shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the merger
consideration described in Section 1.6(a), but the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by Washington Law. Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any notice of intent to demand fair
value for any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices and
any other instruments served pursuant to Washington Law and received by
Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for fair value for shares of Company Common Stock under
Washington Law. Company shall not, except with the


                                      -4-
<PAGE>


prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for fair value for shares of Company Common Stock or offer to
settle or settle any such demands.

     1.7 Surrender of Certificates; Payment of Stock Consideration.

     (a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in
the Merger. (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for exchange in
accordance with this Article I, (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions to which
holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section
1.7(d).

     (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time
(and in any event within five business days after Parent's receipt of all
necessary shareholder list and other supporting information), Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective
Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates"), which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.6, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f)
and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d), (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant
to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company
Common Stock were converted at the Effective Time, payment in lieu of
fractional shares which such holders have the right to receive pursuant to
Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until
so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, subject to Section 1.7(d) as to the
payment of dividends and other distributions, to evidence only the ownership of
the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of
Company Common Stock shall have been so converted and the right to receive an
amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance
with Section 1.6(f).

     (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will
be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered


                                      -5-
<PAGE>


Certificate(s) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby until the holders of record of such Certificate(s) shall surrender such
Certificate(s). Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such
Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof,
without interest, a certificate(s) representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) hereof and the amount of any such dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

     (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate representing shares of
Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the

the Company Schedules (the "Company Plans"). Company has provided or will make

each Company Plan including (without limitation) all amendments thereto, all
related trust documents, and all material written agreements and contracts

relating to any amendments, terminations, establishments, increases or decreases
in benefits, acceleration of payments or vesting schedules, or other events
which would result in any material liability to Company or any Affiliate.

     (b) Each Company Plan has been maintained and administered in all material
respects in compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations (foreign or domestic),
including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such
Company Plans. No suit, action or other litigation (excluding claims for
benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Company Plan activities) has been
brought, or to the knowledge of Company, is threatened, against or with respect
to any such Company Plan. There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened by the Internal Revenue Service
(the "IRS") or Department of Labor (the "DOL") with respect to any Company
Plans. All contributions, reserves or premium payments required to be made or
accrued as of the date hereof to the Company Plans have been timely made or
accrued. Any Company Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code (i)
has either obtained a favorable determination, notification, advisory and/or
opinion letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status from the IRS or still
has a remaining period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination, and (ii) incorporates or has
been amended to incorporate all provisions required to comply with the Tax
Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation. To the knowledge of Company, no
condition or circumstance exists giving rise to a material likelihood that any
such Company Plan would not be treated as qualified by the IRS. Company does
not have any plan or commitment to establish any new Company Plan, to modify
any Company Plan (except to the extent required by law or to conform any such
Company Plan to the requirements of any applicable law, in each case as
previously disclosed to Parent in writing, or as required by the terms of any
Company Plan or this Agreement), or to enter into any new Company Plan. Each
Company Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without liability to Parent,
Company or any of its Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses).


     (c) Neither Company, any of its subsidiaries, nor any of their Affiliates
has at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or
contributed to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
and at no time has Company contributed to or been requested to contribute to
any "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in ERISA. Neither Company,
any of its subsidiaries, nor any officer or director of Company or any of its
subsidiaries is subject to any material liability or penalty under Section 4975
through 4980B of the Code or Title I of ERISA. No "prohibited transaction,"
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of
ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 4975 of the Code and Section 408
of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Company Plan which could subject
Company or its Affiliates to material liability.

     (d) None of the Company Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person except as required by applicable
law, and neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has represented, promised
or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to


                                      -16
<PAGE>


provide such retiree benefits to any Company Employee, former employee,
director, consultant or other person, except to the extent required by statute.

     (e) Company is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
material foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations
respecting employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment
and wages and hours.

     (f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any
payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute,
bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any shareholder, director or Company
Employee or any of its subsidiaries under any Company Plan or otherwise, (ii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Plan, or (iii) result
in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

     2.14 Absence of Liens and Encumbrances. Company and each of its
subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties

with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be satisfied;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

     5.7 Third Party Consents. As soon as practicable following the date hereof,
Parent and Company will each use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries'
respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     5.8 Stock Options; Warrants; Employee Stock Purchase Plan; 401(k) Plan.

     (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") under any of the Company
Option Plans, whether or not vested, and each outstanding Company Warrant,
whether or not then exercisable, shall by virtue of the Merger be assumed by
Parent. Each Company Stock Option and each Company Warrant so assumed by Parent
under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions of such options or warrants immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including, without limitation, any repurchase rights or vesting
provisions, including, to the extent not otherwise waived, accelerated vesting
on the terms provided in Company's 1997 Stock Option Plan for options granted
prior to January 10, 2000), except that (i) each Company Stock Option and each
Company Warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance
with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Company Stock Option or Company Warrant, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option or Company Warrant
will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock at


                                     -44-
<PAGE>


which such Company Stock Option or Company Warrant, as applicable, was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

     (b) Prior to the Effective Time, outstanding purchase rights under the
Company ESPP shall be exercised in accordance with Section 20(b) of the 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP") and each share of Company
Common Stock purchased pursuant to such exercise shall by virtue of the Merger,
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise of such purchase rights under the Comapny ESPP immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio without issuance of
certificates representing issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
to Company ESPP participants. Company agrees that it shall terminate the
Company ESPP immediately following the aforesaid purchase of shares of Company
Common Stock thereunder.

     (c) Company agrees to terminate its 401(k) Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent agrees to take, or cause to be taken, such actions as
are necessary to permit participants in Company's 401(k) plans to roll over
their accounts under such plans, after the Effective Time (and after completion
of the termination of Company's 401(k) plan), into a qualified plan or plans
maintained by Parent.

     (d) Parent shall cause employees of Company and its subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time ("Affected Employees") to be credited with service with Company
and each of its subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting under each
employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries after the
Effective Time to the extent of their service with Company provided, however,
that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in duplication of benefits. To the extent permitted by the Parent
Plans and applicable law, Parent will, or will cause Company to (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have
not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained
for the Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
provide each Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are
eligible to participate in after the Effective Time. Affected Employees shall
be eligible to participate in the stock option and other stock incentive plans
maintained by Parent after the Effective Time to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, Affected
Employees shall be able to participate in the employee stock purchase plan of
Parent as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time.

     (e) Parent shall provide Affected Employees with severance benefits in
accordance with the terms set forth in Section 5.8(e) of the Company Schedule.

     5.9 Form S-8; Section 16. Parent agrees to file, if available
for use by Parent, a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Stock Options as
soon as is reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten business days)
after the Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall use its best efforts to
cause Parent's Board of Directors to approve the issuance of such shares of
Parent Common Stock, with respect to any employees of the Company who will
become Section 16 insiders of Parent to the extent necessary for such issuance
to be an exempt acquisition pursuant to SEC Rule 16b-3.

     5.10 Indemnification.

     (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Company and its directors
and officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and any
indemnification provisions under the Company Charter Documents as in effect on
the date hereof. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the indemnified parties
thereunder (the "Indemnified Parties") as those contained in the Company
Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by law.

     (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, if available, directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered
by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in an
amount and on terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and
officers of the Company; provided, however, that in no event will Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage
in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company.

     (c) In the event that Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person in a single transaction or a series of transactions, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall make or cause to be made proper provisions so that the
successors and assigns of Parent assume the indemnification obligations of
Parent under this Section 5.10 for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties.

     (d) This Section 5.10 shall survive the consummation of the merger, is
intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each Indemnified
Party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties.

FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any other
jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate; provided,

of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent or
its subsidiaries or affiliates or of Company, its affiliates, or the imposition
of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

Directors, then other individuals designated by Company and reasonably
acceptable to Parent) shall be appointed to Parent's Board of Directors as of
the Effective Time with terms expiring at the 2002 and 2003 annual meetings of
Parent's stockholders and (b) upon such appointment the Board of Directors of

Agreement under Section 7.1 above will be effective immediately upon the
delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto
(or such later time as may be required by Section 7.1). In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in this Section 7.2,
Section 5.3(a), Section 7.3 and Article 8, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for fraud in connection with, or any willful breach of, this
Agreement.

     7.3 Fees and Expenses.

     (a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether
or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and Company
shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys' and
accountants fees and expenses, incurred (i) in relation to the printing and
filing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including any preliminary
materials related thereto) and the S-4 (including financial statements and
exhibits) and any amendments or supplements thereto or (ii) for the premerger
notification and report forms under the HSR Act.

     (b) Termination Fee Payable by Company.

          (i) In the event that (A) Parent shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(g), or (B) this Agreement shall be terminated (x)
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or (y) pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) and (1) at or
prior to such termination, there shall exist or have been proposed an
Acquisition Proposal that has not been publicly, irrevocably and
unconditionally withdrawn prior to such termination and (2) within 6 months
after any such termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or within 12 months after
any such termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i), as the case may be, Company
shall enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition
(which Company Acquisition is later consummated) or any Company Acquisition
shall be consummated, then, in the case of clause (A), promptly after such
termination, or in the case of clause (B), concurrently with the consummation
of such Company Acquisition, Company shall pay to Parent $36 million in cash
(the "Termination Fee").

          (ii) In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(i), then promptly after such termination Company shall pay to
Parent $15 million in cash; provided, however, that no fee shall be payable
pursuant to this Section 7.3(b)(ii) if (A) prior to the payment of such fee,

the representations of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall

          (iv) Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.3(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts
due pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against Company for the amounts
set forth in this Section 7.3(b), Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3(b) at the
prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to

disposition by Company of assets representing in excess of 40% of the aggregate
fair market value of Company's business immediately prior to such sale or (C)

beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
representing in excess of 40% of the voting power of the then outstanding

pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or (y) pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and (1) at or
prior to such termination, there shall exist or have been proposed a Parent
Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that for purposes of this Section
7.3(c)(i) the definition of "Parent Acquisition Proposal" (and the related
definition of "Parent Acquisition Transaction" shall not include the phrase
"(m) is (1) conditioned upon termination of the Merger Agreement or (2)
structured in a manner that makes is impossible to consummate such transaction
or series of related transactions and the Merger and (n)") that has not been
publicly, irrevocably and unconditionally withdrawn prior to such termination
and (2) within 6 months after any such termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)
or within 12 months after any such termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii),
as the case may be, Parent shall enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to any Parent Acquisition (which Parent Acquisition is later consummated) or
any Parent Acquisition shall be consummated, then, in the case of clause (A),
promptly after such termination, or in the case of clause (B), concurrently
with the consummation of such Parent Acquisition, Parent shall pay to Company
the Termination Fee.

          (ii) In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii), then promptly after such termination Company shall pay to
Parent $15 million in


                                     -53-
<PAGE>


cash; provided, however, that no fee shall be payable pursuant to this Section
7.3(c)(ii) if (A) prior to the payment of such fee, Parent shall have paid or
become obligated to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(c)(i) or
(B) at the time of such vote of Parent's shareholders, the representations of
Company contained in this Agreement shall have become untrue or inaccurate, or
Company shall have failed to comply with in any material respect any covenant
or agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement, in each case such
that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not be
satisfied (excluding clause (B)(z) of Section 8.3(b)(ii) for the purpose of
this analysis)). Any fee payable pursuant to this Section 7.3(c)(ii) will be
credited against any Termination Fee that Parent becomes obligated to pay
pursuant to Section 7.3(c)(i).

          (iii) In the event that Company shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(e), then Parent shall promptly reimburse Company for
Company's costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

          (iv) Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.3(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Company would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts
due pursuant to this Section 7.3(c) and, in order to obtain such payment,
Company makes a claim that results in a judgment against Parent for the amounts
set forth in this Section 7.3(c), Parent shall pay to Company its costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3(c) at the
prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made. Payment of the fees described in this Section 7.3(c) shall not be in
lieu of damages incurred in the event of willful breach of this Agreement. For
the purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Acquisition" shall mean any of the
following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement): (A) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Parent pursuant to which the stockholders of Parent immediately preceding such
transaction hold less than 60% of the aggregate equity interests in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, (B) a sale or other
disposition by Parent of assets representing in excess of 40% of the aggregate
fair market value of Parent's business immediately prior to such sale or (C)
the acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender offer or
an exchange offer or issuance by Parent ), directly or indirectly, of
beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
representing in excess of 40% of the voting power of the then outstanding
shares of capital stock of Parent.

     7.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company.

     7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit
of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set


                                     -54-

forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such
right.

     (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, such reference
shall be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a
Section of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated the words "include,"
"includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. When
reference is made herein to "the business of" an entity, such reference shall
be deemed to include the business of all direct and indirect subsidiaries of
such entity. Reference to the subsidiaries of an entity shall be deemed to

     (b) For purposes of this Agreement:

          (i) the term "knowledge" means with respect to a party hereto, with
respect to any matter in question, the actual knowledge of the executive
officers of such party;

          (ii) the term "Material Adverse Effect" when used in connection with
an entity means any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect
that is, or is reasonably likely to be, materially adverse to the business,
assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of such
entity and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that in no
event shall (A) a decrease in such entity's stock price or the failure to meet
or exceed Wall Street research analysts' or such entity's internal earnings or
other estimates or projections in and of itself constitute a Material Adverse
Effect or (B) any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect
that results from (x) changes affecting the industry in which such entity

of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

     8.5 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure

except as specifically provided in Section 5.10.

     8.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

     8.7 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one

Law, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
