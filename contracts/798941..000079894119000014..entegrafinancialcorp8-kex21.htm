ARTICLE III

MERGER CONSIDERATION

provisions of this ARTICLE III, solely by virtue and as a result of the
Merger, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall at the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder(s) thereof, be converted into and canceled in exchange for the right to
receive cash from BancShares in the amount of $30.18, subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 3.7 below (the "Merger Consideration").

Section 3.2 Exchange Procedures. (a)Deposit with Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Closing, BancShares shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to an exchange agent mutually agreed upon by
BancShares and the Company, which the Parties agree in advance may be
BancShares' customary stock transfer agent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of holders of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Excluded
Shares) cash in an amount sufficient to make payment in respect of the Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Excluded Shares) as provided in Section 3.1 above and cash in an
amount sufficient to pay holders of Company RSU Awards that will be receiving
Company Common Stock at the Effective Time. Pending disbursement of the Merger
Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock, BancShares may direct
the Exchange Agent to invest such cash in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America, in commercial paper obligations receiving the
highest rating from Standard and Poor's Corporation, in money market funds which
are invested solely as provided above, in certificates of deposit of or other
deposit accounts in domestic commercial banks (including BancShares, and
provided that such accounts are designated by the depository banks as
containing funds held by the Exchange Agent for the benefit of BancShares and
the former holders of Company Common Stock), or in such other investments as
to which BancShares and the Exchange Agent shall agree (collectively, the
"Permitted Investments"), any of which Permitted Investments shall have a
maturity that will not prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
ARTICLE III. All interest, dividends or other income on the invested funds
shall belong solely to BancShares. If for any reason (including losses on
invested funds) the funds held by the Exchange Agent are inadequate to pay the
amounts to which the holders of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under
this ARTICLE III, BancShares shall be liable for the payment of any
deficiency.

(b)Letter of Transmittal. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Company shall deliver, or shall cause its stock transfer agent to deliver,
to the Exchange Agent a certified listing of record holders of Company Common
Stock, in such electronic format, and together with such information as the
Exchange Agent shall request, including the numbers of shares held of record
by those holders as of the Effective Time and their addresses and taxpayer
identification numbers and such other information in the Company's or its
transfer agent's records as is requested by the Exchange Agent in connection
with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for cash (including
information regarding the certified status of holders' taxpayer identification
numbers). During the two weeks prior to the anticipated Effective Time, the
Company will cooperate with the Exchange Agent, including by providing test
files, to ensure that the above certified listing, when delivered, will
include such information, and be in such electronic form and format, as is
reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent in order for it and the exchange of
shares for cash to be entered in and processed on the Exchange Agent's system.
BancShares shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Exchange
Agent to, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Exchange Agent's receipt
of the above information in the form it requests (but in no event later than
ten Business Days after the Exchange Agent's receipt of such information),
mail or deliver to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of Excluded
Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such
provisions as BancShares shall reasonably require (including provisions
confirming that delivery of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall be
effected, and that risk of loss of and title to Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or in respect of such Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

(c)Payment of Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent for exchange and cancellation,
together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or
an "agent's message," in the case of Book-Entry Shares held in street name)
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
(i) the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and the Exchange Agent shall issue and deliver
to such holder, the Merger Consideration to which such holder shall have
become entitled pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE III, in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or to such Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, and (ii) the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
be canceled. In the event the Merger Consideration or any other amounts
payable under this Agreement to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock is
to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name such shares are registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance
or payment of such Merger Consideration or other amounts that the Certificate
formerly representing such shares, or, in the case of non-certificated shares,
the Book-Entry Shares, be presented to the Exchange Agent, together with
evidence of or appropriate documents or instruments for transfer and evidence
that any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable, all in such form as the Exchange Agent shall reasonably require.

(d)Closing of Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall thereafter be no further
transfers of shares of Company Stock on the books or records of the Company,
and if any shares of Company Stock are thereafter presented to BancShares or
the Exchange Agent for transfer, such shares shall be cancelled against
delivery of the Merger Consideration issuable or payable in respect thereof as
herein provided. Until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
shall, at and after the Effective Time, evidence and represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration issuable or payable in respect thereof (or
the Company Common Stock previously represented thereby) in accordance with
this Agreement. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any amounts
issuable or payable to holders of Company Common Stock under or in accordance
with this Agreement.

(e)Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed
and the execution by such Person of an indemnity agreement and/or the posting
by such Person of a bond in such customary form and amount as BancShares or
the Exchange Agent may reasonably require as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against them with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement.

(f)Unclaimed Merger Consideration. Any Merger Consideration, and any other
amounts payable by BancShares to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with this Agreement, in each case that remain(s) unclaimed by
former shareholders of the Company for nine months after the Effective Time
shall at the request of BancShares be delivered by the Exchange Agent to
BancShares. Any former shareholder of the Company who has not theretofore
complied with the exchange procedures provided for in this Agreement shall
thereafter look only to BancShares for the Merger Consideration (and any other
amounts) payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock previously
held by such shareholder, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without
any interest thereon. If the Merger Consideration or any other amounts payable
under this Agreement in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock is not
claimed prior to the date on which such Merger Consideration or other amounts
would otherwise escheat to any Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration
or other amounts shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property,
escheat, and other applicable Laws, become the property of BancShares (and to
the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of
all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled to such property.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any Party to this Agreement shall be liable to
any holder of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration (or any other
property) properly paid or delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws. BancShares and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books and
records of the Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration (and any other amounts) specified in this
Agreement, which books and records shall be conclusive with respect thereto.
In the event of a dispute regarding the ownership of Company Common Stock,
BancShares and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger
Consideration (or any other amounts) issuable or payable in respect thereof in
escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect
to any claims or Liability with respect thereto.

Section 3.3 Rights as Company Shareholders. Holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at and after the Effective
Time, cease to be shareholders of the Company and have no further rights as
shareholders of the Company, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable in respect of such holders'
Company Common Stock in accordance with this ARTICLE III. Section 3.4 Excluded Shares. At the Effective Time, each Excluded Share shall
be automatically canceled and retired for no consideration and shall cease to
exist, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no exchange or payment shall be made
with respect thereto or in respect thereof.

Section 3.5 Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the
Effective Time be converted into and become one share of common stock, no par
value, of the Interim Surviving Company.

Section 3.6 BancShares Stock. The shares of BancShares Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be affected by
the Merger, and, accordingly, each share of BancShares Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at and after the
Effective Time, remain issued and outstanding.

Section 3.7 Adjustments Upon Change in Capitalization. If during the period
from the date of this Agreement until immediately prior to the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are increased, decreased, or
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities as a
result of a reorganization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an equitable
and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the per share Merger
Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, the issuance of shares of Company
Common Stock upon the exercise or settlement of, or the lapse of restrictions
with respect to, Company Equity Awards shall not cause or result in an
adjustment of or to the per share Merger Consideration. This Section 3.7 shall
not be interpreted to authorize any action prohibited by any other provision
of this Agreement.

Section 3.8 Company Equity Awards.

(a)At the Effective Time, solely by virtue and as a result of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Company Option,
whether vested or unvested, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive a cash
payment from BancShares in an amount equal to (i) the per share Merger
Consideration, less the per share exercise price of such Company Option,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by
that Company Option, and (iii) less the amount of any required Tax withholding
(the "Option Payment"). Prior to and as a condition of his or her receipt of
the Option Payment, and before the Effective Time, each holder of a Company
Option shall execute a cancellation agreement in a form reasonably acceptable
to BancShares and the Company. At the Effective Time, BancShares shall deliver
checks for the Option Payments to the holders of Company Options. Nothing
herein shall prevent any holder from exercising, before the Effective Time,
any Company Option that is exercisable according to its terms and any Company
Common Stock issued upon such exercise shall be converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the per share Merger Consideration. Prior to
the Effective Time, each of the Company and BancShares shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all action necessary to provide for the cash out of
any such Company Options by BancShares in the manner contemplated by this
Section 3.8(a).

(b)At the Effective Time, solely by virtue and as a result of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Company RSU Award
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest
and shall be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1 (payable in accordance with
this ARTICLE III and subject to any required Tax withholding), treating the
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award in the same
manner as all other shares of Company Common Stock for such purposes.

Section 3.9 Withholding Rights. BancShares and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration issuable, payable, or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such amounts
as are required under or by the Code or any other applicable Law to be
deducted or withheld. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be timely
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity and, to the extent so
remitted, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

character of the properties or assets owned or leased by it or the nature of

except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified, or in good standing has

Company. The outstanding capital stock or other outstanding equity or
ownership interests of each Subsidiary of the Company and/or the Bank have
been validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid, and non-

examination conducted by any taxing authority that, by application of the same
principles, might result, individually or in the aggregate, in a proposed
material deficiency for any other period not so examined. There are no Liens
for Taxes upon any of the properties or assets of the Company Parties or any

provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise.

(viii)Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, will be

Person is infringing, misappropriating, diluting, or otherwise violating any
Intellectual Property owned, used, or held for use by the Company or the Bank
or any of their Subsidiaries in the conduct of their respective businesses as
currently conducted. To the Knowledge of the Company, no officer, director, or

(other than the Company or the Bank) that requires such officer, director, or
employee to assign any interest in any Intellectual Property to such Person.

(ii)The Company and the Bank (or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable)

Systems (A) have been reasonably properly maintained in accordance with

the industry and (B) are in good working condition to effectively perform all

Subsidiaries have implemented a comprehensive written information security
program and, since January 1, 2014, have at all times maintained and had in

practices; (Y) ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of the
Company Data and the Company IT Systems; and (Z) protect against any Company

Privacy Laws and all representations, warranties, statements, contracts, and
commitments that the Company or the Bank or their Subsidiaries have made or
entered into with respect to the collection, use, disclosure, transfer,

including without limitation (A) all privacy or data protection policies,
notices, statements, and similar disclosures published or otherwise made
available by the Company or the Bank or their Subsidiaries; (B) all internal
policies, procedures, or standards regarding the security or protection of
Personal Information; and (C) any contractual commitment made by the Company
or the Bank or their Subsidiaries with respect to the privacy,

Information Security Incident and there has not been any Company Information
Security Incident. No suit, action, litigation, claim, or legal or
administrative proceeding, and to the Knowledge of the Company no
investigation, related to information or data security or privacy is pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against, or has at any time
since January 1, 2016, been pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against, the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries. No
Person (including any Governmental Entity) has made any formal claim or
commenced any action or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any investigation
against or with respect to the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries relating to any Company Information
Security Incident or violation of Privacy Laws. The Company and the Bank and
their Subsidiaries have all necessary rights and permissions to access,
obtain, use, maintain, store, collect, disclose, and transfer Personal
Information. The Company and the Bank and their Subsidiaries have not sold,
licensed, rented, traded, or otherwise transferred ownership of any Personal
Information to a third party, nor have they purchased, licensed, or rented any
Personal Information from a third party.

January 1, 2016, have been, in compliance with all applicable Laws respecting
employment, retention of independent contractors, employment practices, terms
and conditions of employment, and wages and hours, except for any such
failures to comply which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, is
or has during the last five years been a party to, or is or has during the
last five years been bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or contract
or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization
with respect to its employees, nor is the Company or the Bank, or any of their
Subsidiaries, the subject of any proceeding in which it is asserted that the
Company or the Bank, or any of their Subsidiaries, has committed an unfair
labor practice or seeking to compel the Company or the Bank, or any of their
Subsidiaries, to bargain with any labor union or labor organization as to
wages and conditions of employment, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has
any such proceeding been threatened, nor is there any strike, labor dispute,
or organizational effort involving the Company or the Bank, or any of their

workers' compensation or disability compensation. Other than compensation and
benefits payable to employees in the ordinary course of business the payment
of which is not delinquent, there are no unpaid wages, salaries, bonuses,
commissions, or other amounts owed to any employee or former employee of the
Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries.

(iii)To the Knowledge of the Company, no director, officer, employee, or
independent contractor of or to the Company or the Bank or any of their
Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by any Contract, including

affect the ability of the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries to
conduct its business as currently conducted or the ability of such Person to
perform and carry out such Person's duties or responsibilities.

(iv)Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has any
material Liability for (A) classifying any Person as an "independent
contractor" or any similar status who, under applicable Law or the provisions

action, claim, or legal, administrative, arbitration, or other proceeding by
or on behalf of any current or former employee of the Company or the Bank or

claim, or legal, administrative, arbitration, or other proceeding alleging
noncompliance with applicable Laws respecting employment, employment
practices, wages and hours, or terms and conditions of employment (but
excluding workers' compensation matters), except for such suits, actions,
claims, or legal, administrative, arbitration, or other proceedings which,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be

(i)Set forth on Schedule 4.2(s)(i) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum is a
true, correct, and complete list of all pension, retirement, survivor income,

related thereto, which are or have been maintained, sponsored, or contributed
to (or required to be contributed to) by the Company or the Bank or an ERISA
Affiliate for the benefit of or with respect to any present or former
directors, officers, employees, independent contractors, or consultants of the
Company or the Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any spouse or
dependent of any such Person, or to or under which the Company or the Bank or
an ERISA Affiliate has or may have any Liability, contingent or otherwise
(herein referred to collectively as the "Company Benefit Plans"), including
any and all plans or policies offered to employees of the Company or the Bank,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, with respect to which the Company or
the Bank or an ERISA Affiliate has claimed or is claiming the safe harbor for
"voluntary plans" under ERISA for group and group-type insurance arrangements
("Company Voluntary Plans"). The Company Parties have previously delivered or
made available to BancShares true, correct, and complete copies of all plans,
contracts, agreements, arrangements, and other documents required to be set
forth on Schedule 4.2(s)(i) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, along with,
where applicable, copies of the IRS Form 5500 for the most recently completed
year. There has been no announcement or commitment by the Company or the Bank,
or any of their Subsidiaries, to create any additional Company Benefit Plan,
to amend any Company Benefit Plan (except for amendments required by
applicable Law which do not materially increase the cost of such Company
Benefit Plan), or to terminate any Company Benefit Plan.

(ii)Other than routine claims for benefits, there is no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened or suspected claim, litigation, action,
administrative action, suit, audit, arbitration, mediation, or other
proceeding relating to any Company Benefit Plan. All of the Company Benefit
Plans comply in all material respects with applicable requirements of ERISA
and the Code and other applicable Laws (including without limitation the
portability, privacy, and security provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended; the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act of 2009, as amended; the coverage continuation
requirements of Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1985, as amended; the Family and Medical Leave Act, as amended; the Mental
Health Parity Act of 1996, as amended; the Mental Health Parity and Addiction
Equity Act of 2008, as amended; the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act, as amended; the Newborns' and Mothers' Health
Protection Act of 1996, as amended; the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act,
as amended; and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, as
amended), and have been established, maintained, and administered in
compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable requirements of
ERISA and the Code and other applicable Laws and the terms and provisions of
all documents, contracts, or agreements establishing the Company Benefit Plans
or pursuant to which they are maintained or administered. To the Knowledge of
the Company, there are no existing circumstances and no event has occurred
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of
any Company Benefit Plan intended to be tax-qualified under Section 401 of the
Code. No audit of any Company Benefit Plan by the IRS, the United States
Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity is ongoing or to the
Knowledge of the Company threatened, or was ongoing or closed or to the
Knowledge of the Company threatened at any time during the past five years. There has
occurred no "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is
likely to result in, or has already resulted in, the imposition of any
penalties or Taxes upon the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries
under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

(iii)No Liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has been, or is
expected by the Company Parties or their Subsidiaries to be, incurred with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (an
"Company Pension Plan"), or with respect to any "single-employer plan" (as
defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or formerly maintained by the
Company or the Bank or any ERISA Affiliate. No Company Pension Plan had an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether
or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan year
ending prior to the date hereof, and no notice of a "reportable event" (as
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the reporting requirement has not
been waived has been required to be filed for any Company Pension Plan within
the 12-month period ending on the date of this Agreement. Neither the Company
nor the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has provided or is required to
provide security to any Company Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of
an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. Neither the
Company nor the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate,
has contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any "multiemployer plan"
as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

(iv)Each Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code (an "Company Qualified Plan") has received a
current favorable determination letter from the IRS (or, in the case of an IRS
pre-approved plan, the pre-approved plan has a current IRS opinion or advisory
letter upon which the Company Parties are entitled to rely under applicable
IRS guidance), and to the Knowledge of the Company there are no facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of
any such favorable determination letter. Each Company Qualified Plan, if any,
that is an "employee stock ownership plan" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(7)
of the Code) has satisfied all of the applicable requirements of Sections 409
and 4975(e)(7) of the Code and the regulations thereunder in all material
respects.

(v)Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has any
obligations for post-employment welfare benefits under any Company Benefit
Plan that cannot be terminated upon 60 days or less notice without incurring
any Liability thereunder, except for coverage required by Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code or similar state Laws, the cost of which is
borne by the electing individuals.

(vi)All contributions and payments required to be made with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan by applicable Law or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any Company Benefit Plan, have been timely made or
paid in full by the applicable due date, with extensions, or to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected or reserved against in the Company Balance Sheet to the extent
required by GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements. Any unfunded Company
Benefit Plan pays benefits solely from the general assets of the Company or
the Bank, or their applicable Subsidiary, for which arrangement the
establishment of a trust under ERISA is not required.

(vii)All required reports, notices, disclosures, and descriptions (including
without limitation Form 5500 annual reports and required attachments, Forms
1099-R, summary annual reports, Forms PBGC-1, and summary plan descriptions)
have been timely filed or distributed in accordance with applicable Law with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan. All required Tax filings with respect to
each Company Benefit Plan have been made, and any Taxes due in connection with
such filings have been paid. Since January 1, 2016, neither the Company nor
the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has filed or been required to file
with the IRS a Form 8928 in order to self-report any health plan violations
which are subject to excise taxes under applicable provisions of the Code, and
there are no facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to
result in the Company or the Bank, or any of their Subsidiaries, being
required by the Code to file any such Form 8928.

(viii)Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, is a
party to or bound by any Contract (including without limitation any severance,
change of control, change in control, salary continuation, or employment agreement) that will, as a result or consequence
of the execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement,
shareholder approval of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or the consummation of the transactions, including the Mergers or the
Bank Merger, contemplated by this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement,
either alone or in connection with any other event, (A) entitle any current or
former director, officer, employee, or independent contractor of the Company
or the Bank, or of any of their Subsidiaries, to severance pay or change of
control or other benefits, or any increase in severance pay or other benefits
(whether upon termination of employment or termination of such Contract after
the date hereof or otherwise), (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable under, or trigger
any withdrawal liability under or any other material obligation pursuant to
any of the Company Benefit Plans, (C) result in any breach or violation of, or
a default under, any of the Company Benefit Plans, or (D) result in the
payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code or the imposition of any Tax under Section 409A of the Code or the
forgiveness of any indebtedness.

(ix)Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in documentary
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and has been administered, as
applicable, (A) in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code during
the period beginning October 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008, and (B) in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2009.

(x)No Person is entitled to receive any additional payment (including without
limitation any Tax gross-up or similar payment) from the Company or the Bank
or any of their Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of any excise Taxes
under Section 4999 of the Code or any Taxes required by Section 409A of the
Code.

(xi)All Company Voluntary Plans satisfy the regulatory safe-harbor
requirements provided by ERISA in order for such Company Voluntary Plans to be
considered not to be or to have been established, sponsored, or maintained by
the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries and not to constitute an
"employee benefit plan" subject to ERISA.

(t)Real and Personal Property.

(i)Set forth on Schedule 4.2(t)(i) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum is a
true, correct, and complete list (by street address) as of the date of this
Agreement of all real property owned by the Company or the Bank or any of
their Subsidiaries, including without limitation property carried on the books
of the Bank as "other real estate owned" (the "Owned Real Property"), and all
real property leased by the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries
(the "Leased Real Property," and together with the Owned Real Property,
collectively, the "Company Properties"). Except for the Company Properties, as
of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor the Bank nor any of
their Subsidiaries holds any interest (fee, leasehold, or otherwise) in any
real property, other than interests as a creditor in real property securing
Bank Loans (as defined below).

(ii)The Company and the Bank and their Subsidiaries have good and marketable
title to all of the Owned Real Property (including any property acquired in a
judicial foreclosure proceeding or by way of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or
similar transfer), in each case free and clear of any and all Liens, except
Permitted Liens. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no material unpaid
bills or claims for work performed on or at the Company Properties, except for
such as are not yet due and payable. None of the Owned Real Property is leased

any such lease, is in breach or default under or in violation of, in any
material respect, any provision of any such lease. The Company Parties have
previously delivered or made available to BancShares a true, correct, and
complete copy of each such lease, including any amendments thereto. The

business as presently conducted; there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened governmental action that has prohibited or materially
interfered with or would reasonably be expected to prohibit or materially
interfere with such access; and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or

both, would reasonably be expected to result in the termination of or material
reduction or impairment of such access. All existing utilities provided at the
Company Properties are adequate in all material respects for the Company
Parties' and their Subsidiaries' existing use and operation of the Company
Properties.

(ix)The Company and the Bank and their Subsidiaries have good and marketable

Parties or their Subsidiaries for which there is a reasonable possibility of
an adverse determination. None of the Loans held by the Company or the Bank or

reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as are customary and

currently held or maintained by or providing coverage for the Company or the
Bank or any of their Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, neither the
Company nor the Bank nor any of their Subsidiaries is in breach or default
under any such insurance policy, and no event has occurred which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default or permit a
termination, modification, or acceleration under any of such insurance
policies. All premiums due and payable under or with respect to such insurance
policies have been timely and fully paid, and all claims thereunder have been
filed in a timely fashion. There is no claim for coverage by the Company or
the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries pending under any of such insurance
policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied, or disputed.

their Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities are valued on the books of
the Company Parties and their Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP. The
Company Parties and their Subsidiaries employ investment, securities,
commodities, risk management, and other similar policies, practices, and
procedures that the Company Parties and their Subsidiaries reasonably believe
are prudent and reasonable in the context of their respective businesses, and
prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company Parties have made available
to BancShares true, correct, and complete copies of or the material terms of
such policies, practices, and procedures. Except for restrictions that exist
for securities that are classified as "held to maturity" or that are pledged
to other Persons, none of the investment securities held by the Company or the
Bank or any of their Subsidiaries are subject to any restriction (whether
contractual, statutory, or otherwise) that would reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of the entity holding such investment securities
freely to dispose of such investment securities at any time. Neither the
Company nor the Bank nor any of their Subsidiaries is a party to or has agreed
to enter into any exchange-traded or over-the-counter equity, interest rate,
foreign exchange, or other swap, forward, future, option, cap, floor, or
collar, or any other Contract that is a derivative contract (including various
combinations thereof), or owns securities that (i) are referred to generically
as "structured notes," "high risk mortgage derivatives," "capped floating rate
notes," or "capped floating rate mortgage derivatives" or (ii) are likely to
have changes in value as a result of interest or exchange rate changes that
materially exceed normal changes in value attributable to interest or exchange
rate changes.

(bb) Securities Transactions. All offers and sales of securities by the
Company or the Bank or their Subsidiaries were at all relevant times exempt
from, or complied in all material respects with, the registration requirements
of the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and applicable state securities or "blue sky" Laws. Neither the Company
Parties nor their Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of the Company any
director, officer, or employee of the Company or the Bank or their
Subsidiaries, any Person related to any such director, officer, or employee by
blood, marriage, or adoption and residing in the same household, or any Person
who has been knowingly provided material nonpublic information by any one or
more of any of the foregoing Persons, has purchased or sold, or caused to be
purchased or sold, any shares of Company Stock or Bank Stock (or other
securities issued by the Company or the Bank or their Subsidiaries) in
violation of any applicable provision of federal or state securities Laws.

(cc) Transactions with Affiliates. All "covered transactions" between the
Bank and any "affiliate" within the meaning of Section 23A and Section 23B of
the Federal Reserve Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto have
been in compliance with such provisions of Law in all material respects.

(dd) Fiduciary Accounts. The Company and the Bank and their Subsidiaries have
properly administered all accounts, if any, for which they serve or act as a
fiduciary, including without limitation accounts for which they serve as
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator, or
investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of all governing documents
and applicable Laws. Neither the Company nor the Bank nor any of their
Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of the Company any of the directors,
officers, or employees of the Company or the Bank or their Subsidiaries, have
committed any breach of trust with respect to any fiduciary account, and the
records for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in all material
respects and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

(ee) CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, and OFAC. The Bank received a rating of
"Satisfactory" or better during its most recent examination or interim review
with respect to the CRA. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts
or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause the Bank (i) to be
considered not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with
the CRA and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating
for CRA purposes by federal banking regulators of lower than "Satisfactory,"
or (ii) to be considered to be operating in violation, in any material
respect, of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the USA PATRIOT Act, any
order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the United States
Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other
applicable anti-money laundering Law. (ff) Internal Controls. The records, systems, controls, data, and information
of the Company and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained, and
operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical, or photographic
process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that, either individually or in the
aggregate, had not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company (i) has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior

committee of the Company's board of directors (A) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize, and report financial information, and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that
the Company's outside auditors and its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, at any time
prior to the Closing Date.

(gg) Regulatory Capital. The Company and the Bank are "well-capitalized" as

Subsidiaries (or the properties or assets of BancShares or FCB or any of their
Subsidiaries) are bound or (B) constitute a breach or violation of or a
default under (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, could

performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of BancShares or FCB or any of their Subsidiaries under,
any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any Contract to which
BancShares or FCB, or any of their Subsidiaries, is a party or to or by which
any of the properties or assets of BancShares or FCB, or any of their

applicable Law; and (vii) consents, approvals, waivers, notices, filings, and

individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on BancShares or FCB
or their Subsidiaries or, after the Mergers and the Bank Merger, the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Bank or their Subsidiaries. As of the date of
this Agreement, BancShares does not have Knowledge of any reason why any of

SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such subsequent filing), the BancShares Securities
Filings complied in all material respects with applicable requirements of the

requirements. Since January 1, 2016, no independent public accounting firm of
BancShares has resigned (or informed BancShares that it intends to resign) or

promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, or from
making any disclosure to its's shareholders required by applicable Law;
provided, however, that compliance by the Company, or its board of directors,
with such rules, regulations, or applicable Law shall not in any way limit or
modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules, regulations,
or applicable Law has under any other provision of this Agreement.

(f)Nothing contained in this Section 7.1 shall (i) prevent the Company or its
board of directors from informing any Person of the Company's obligations
under this Section 7.1 or (ii) prevent the Company's board of directors from
taking the actions permitted by Section 7.7(b) of this Agreement.

Section 7.2 Notice of Certain Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each Party

circumstance, or condition that (a) constitutes or has caused, or would
reasonably be expected to cause, a material breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of such Party set forth
in this Agreement, provided, however, that no such notification shall (i)
affect the representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of the
Parties, or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties, contained in
this Agreement or (ii) be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure

Subsidiaries with a title of executive vice-president or higher intends to
terminate his or her employment with such Party or any of its Subsidiaries,
such Party promptly shall give the other Parties notice of the same. The
failure of a Party to comply with this Section 7.2 shall not in and of itself
constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.2 or Section
8.3 to be satisfied unless the underlying fact, event, occurrence,
circumstance, or condition would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 to be satisfied.

Section 7.3 Access and Information.

(a)Prior to the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, for the purpose of
BancShares and FCB verifying the representations and warranties of the Company
and compliance by the Company with its covenants and agreements set forth
herein, and preparing for the Mergers and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement (including for purposes of integration planning), the Company
shall, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to BancShares and FCB and
their representatives (including their directors, officers, and employees and
financial advisors, legal counsel, accountants, and other professionals
retained by BancShares or FCB) reasonable access during normal business hours
to the books, records, Contracts, properties, assets, personnel, and
information technology systems of the Company Parties and their Subsidiaries,

Subsidiaries as BancShares or FCB may reasonably request.

(b)From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each Party shall
promptly furnish or make available to the other Parties (i) a copy of any
report, application, notice, schedule, or other document or instrument filed by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries with or received by

Law) and (ii) such other information regarding such Party and its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective businesses, properties, assets, liabilities, or
personnel as the other Parties may reasonably request.

this Section 7.3 shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the business operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. No
investigation by BancShares, FCB or their representatives pursuant to this
Section 7.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements of the Company set forth in this
Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide
access to or to disclose information pursuant to this Section 7.3 where such
access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of customers of the
Company Parties, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company Party
in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration
to the existence of any common interest, joint defense, or similar agreement
between the Parties), or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty, or binding
Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company agrees
to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the immediately preceding sentence apply.

(d)The Confidentiality Agreement, to the extent the same is not inconsistent
with the terms of this Agreement, will remain in full force and effect
following the date of this Agreement, whether or not the Merger occurs, in
accordance with its terms, and each of BancShares, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or their
representatives, pursuant to this Agreement in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

the Regulatory Approvals, necessary or advisable to consummate the Mergers,

contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party shall keep the other Parties
reasonably apprised of the status of material matters relating to the
consummation of such transactions.

approvals, waivers, and authorizations under any such Laws that may be
required by any Governmental Authority to enable the Parties to close the
Mergers, the Bank Merger, and such other transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, BancShares and FCB agree, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries, to take all Remedial Action necessary to obtain any Regulatory
Approvals and cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur
prior to the Outside Date.

(iii)In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 7.4(a)(i) and Section
7.4(a)(ii), if any action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened)
challenging the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violating any Law or if any decree, order, judgment, or injunction (whether
temporary, preliminary, or permanent) is entered, enforced, or attempted to be
entered or enforced by any Governmental Authority that would make the Mergers,
the Bank Merger, or such other transactions as are contemplated hereby illegal
or otherwise delay or prohibit the consummation of the Merger, BancShares, FCB
and their Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall take any and all actions to
contest and defend any such claim, cause of action, or proceeding to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, repealed, rescinded, or
terminated, any decree, order, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary,

Agreement, each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly take, or cause to be promptly taken, all actions, and to promptly do,
or cause to be promptly done, all things, necessary, proper, or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as reasonably possible,
including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or
non-actions, extensions, waivers, consents, and approvals from Governmental
Entities, effecting all necessary registrations, applications, and filings
(including without limitation filings under any applicable federal or state
securities Laws), and obtaining any required contractual consents and
regulatory approvals.

Section 7.6 Publicity. Each Party shall consult with the other Parties before
issuing any press release or making any public statements or disclosures
(including written communications to shareholders) with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions, including the Mergers and the Bank Merger,
contemplated hereby, and no Party shall issue any such press release or make
any such public statements or disclosures without the prior consent of the
other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 7.6 shall prohibit a
Party from making any disclosure necessary in order to satisfy such Party's
disclosure obligations under applicable Law.

Section 7.7 Company Shareholders Meeting.

(a)The Company and its board of directors shall take, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company's articles of incorporation and bylaws, all
action necessary to call, give notice of, convene, and hold, as promptly as

Company's shareholders (including any and all adjournments or postponements
thereof, the "Company Meeting") for the purpose of the Company's shareholders
considering and voting on approval of this Agreement and any other matters
required to be approved by the Company's shareholders in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as well as, if mutually
agreed upon by the Parties, any other matters of the type customarily brought
before a meeting of shareholders to approve an agreement such as this
Agreement. Except with the prior approval of BancShares, no other matters
shall be submitted for consideration by or the approval of the Company's
shareholders at the Company Meeting. Subject to Section 7.7(b)), (i) the
Company and its board of directors shall at all times prior to and during the
Company Meeting recommend to the Company's shareholders the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and take all reasonable and
lawful action to solicit and obtain such approval (the "Company Board
Recommendation") and (ii) the Company's board of directors shall not withdraw,
modify, or qualify in any manner adverse to BancShares its recommendation that
the Company's shareholders approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
or take any other action or make any other public statement inconsistent with
such recommendation (the actions prohibited by this clause (ii) being referred
to as an "Company Change of Recommendation").

(b)Notwithstanding Section 7.7(a), the Company's board of directors may make a
Company Change of Recommendation if, but only if:

(i)The Company has complied in all material respects with Section 7.1;

(ii)The Company's board of directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with and based on the advice of outside legal counsel) that its
failure to make a Company Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

(iii)In the event the Company Change of Recommendation stems from or is a
result of, or relates in any manner to, an Acquisition Proposal, (A) the
Company's board of directors has determined in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (B) the Company notifies
BancShares at least five Business Days prior to making the Company Change of
Recommendation of its intention to make such Company Change of Recommendation
in response to such Superior Proposal, and furnishes to BancShares the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, a copy of the proposed
transaction agreement(s) and all other documents relating to such Superior
Proposal, and a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving
rise to its determination to take such action; (C) prior to effecting the
Company Change of Recommendation, the Company negotiates, and causes its
financial, legal, and other advisors to negotiate, in good faith with
BancShares, during the five Business Day period following the Company's
delivery of the notice referred to in clause (B) above (to the extent
BancShares desires to so negotiate), to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal; and (D) after the conclusion of such five
Business Day period, the Company's board of directors determines in good
faith, after giving effect to all of the adjustments (if any) which may be
offered by BancShares pursuant to clause (C) above, that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being agreed that in
the event that, following the Company's delivery of the notice referred to in
clause (B) above, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior
Proposal, including, any revision in price, the five Business Day period
during which the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith shall be extended,
if applicable, to ensure that at least three Business Days remain to negotiate
subsequent to the time the Company notifies BancShares of any such material
revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions)).

(c)Notwithstanding any Company Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement
has been terminated, the Company Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement
shall be submitted to the shareholders of the Company at the Company Meeting
for the purpose of the Company's shareholders considering and voting on
approval of this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by
the Company's shareholders in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Additionally, unless this Agreement has been
terminated, the Company shall not submit to or for a vote of its shareholders
any Acquisition Proposal.

(d)The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting if (i) as of the
date of the Company Meeting there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute the quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meeting, (ii) as of the date
of the Company Meeting the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary for the approval of this Agreement by
the shareholders of the Company in accordance with the Company's articles of
incorporation and bylaws and applicable Law, or (iii) required by applicable
Law in order to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the Company's shareholders a reasonable amount of
time prior to the Company Meeting; provided that, in the case of clauses (i)
and (ii), the Company shall not be required to adjourn or postpone the Company
Meeting more than two times.



 Section 7.8 Employee and Benefit Matters

(a)Subject to applicable Law and the terms of FCB's employee benefit plans,
FCB will, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, provide
employees of the Bank who become employees of FCB at or immediately following
the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees") with benefits under the
Company Benefit Plans that they participate in at the Effective Time, to the
extent those continue to be maintained by FCB for some time following the
Effective Time, or, at FCB's election, with benefits that are the same as
those provided to similarly situated employees of FCB as of the date of this
Agreement; provided that in no event shall any Continuing Employee participate
in FCB's defined benefit pension plans which have been frozen to new
participants. With respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by FCB, excluding both any retiree health
care plans or programs maintained by FCB and any deferred compensation plans
or arrangements maintained by FCB (collectively, "Employee Plans"), in which
any Continuing Employees will participate effective as of or after the
Effective Time, FCB will provide credit for prior service of Continuing
Employees with the Bank for vesting and eligibility purposes, but not for
benefit accrual purposes other than under FCB's paid time off policy and
Position Elimination Policy; provided that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that (i) such recognition of service would result in
a duplication of benefits or (ii) such service was not recognized under a
corresponding Company Benefit Plan. With respect to Employee Plans providing
health care, dental, or vision coverage, FCB will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any pre-existing condition, eligibility waiting period, or
other limitations or exclusions otherwise applicable under such plans to new
employees not to apply to the Continuing Employees or their eligible spouses
and eligible dependents who were covered under a similar Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Further, if Continuing Employees
experience a transition in health care coverage during the middle of a plan
year, BancShares or FCB, as appropriate, will make a one-time payment of
additional compensation as part of FCB's first payment of salary and wages to
Continuing Employees who elect health care coverage under the First-Citizens
Bank and Trust Company Welfare Benefit Plan in an amount to be agreed upon by
the Parties and based upon the health care coverage the Continuing Employee
had under the Company's group medical plan. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of any pertinent
plan documents, BancShares and its Subsidiaries may after the Effective Time
maintain multiple benefit plans providing health care, dental, or vision
coverage and/or multiple retirement savings plans.

(b)At the request of BancShares, the Company shall take, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to take, prior to the Effective Time, all actions reasonably
requested by BancShares that are necessary or appropriate to (i) cause one or
more of the Company Benefits Plans (including those Company Benefits Plans set
forth on Schedule 7.8(b) of the BancShares Disclosure Memorandum) to terminate
or be frozen as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cause
benefit accruals and entitlements under any Company Benefit Plan to cease as
of or immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) cause the continuation at
and after the Effective Time of any insurance policy or other Contract
relating to any Company Benefit Plan for such period as may be requested by
BancShares, or (iv) facilitate the merger of any Company Benefit Plan into any
employee benefit plan maintained by BancShares or its Subsidiaries. All
resolutions, notices, or other documents adopted, issued, or executed in
connection with the implementation of this Section 7.8(b) shall be subject to
BancShares' prior review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(c)BancShares or FCB will provide to (i) employees of the Bank immediately
prior to the Effective Time who are not offered continued employment with
BancShares or one of its Subsidiaries and (ii) Continuing Employees whose
employment is involuntarily terminated by BancShares or its Subsidiaries
without cause during the six-month period immediately following the Effective
Time (collectively, "Severed Employees"), and who are not otherwise entitled
to contractual or other severance or change in control benefits, severance
benefits in the amounts set forth on Schedule 7.8(c) of the BancShares
Disclosure Memorandum, taking into account the prior service of the Severed
Employees with the Bank prior to the Effective Time and with BancShares, FCB
and their Subsidiaries thereafter; provided that it shall be a condition to
payment of any such severance benefits that the Severed Employee executes a
release of claims, which release shall be in a form that complies with Section
409A of the Code and is reasonably acceptable to BancShares. Any such payments
of severance benefits (including the timing of the same) shall be in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code. For purposes of this Section 7.8(c),
"cause" shall have the same meaning as provided in any written employment
agreement between any Severed Employee and BancShares, FCB and/or their Subsidiaries on the date
such Severed Employee's employment is terminated, or if no such definition or
employment agreement exists, "cause" shall mean conduct amounting to (i) fraud
or dishonesty against or to BancShares, FCB or their Subsidiaries, (ii) the
Severed Employee's willful misconduct, repeated refusal to follow the
reasonable directions of his or her superiors, or knowing violation of Law in
the course or scope of performance of services to or for BancShares, FCB or
their Subsidiaries; (iii) repeated absences from work without a reasonable
excuse; (iv) intoxication with alcohol or drugs while on the premises of
BancShares, FCB or their Subsidiaries during regular business hours; (v) a
conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or a crime
involving dishonesty; or (vi) a material breach or violation of the terms of
any agreement to which the Severed Employee and BancShares, FCB or their
Subsidiaries are parties.

(d)This Section 7.8 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
the Parties, and nothing in this Section 7.8, express or implied, shall confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Section 7.8. Nothing contained in this Section 7.8, express
or implied, (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit
plan, program, agreement, or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the
ability of the Surviving Corporation, BancShares, or FCB, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, to amend, modify, or terminate any
benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored, or maintained by any of them. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the provisions of this Section 7.8 shall not create any right
in any employee of the Company or the Bank or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or any other Person, to continued employment with the Surviving
Corporation, BancShares, or FCB, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (and shall not limit the right of the Surviving Corporation,
BancShares, or FCB, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, to
terminate the employment of any employee), or any compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever.

Section 7.9 Indemnification.

(a)For a period of six years immediately following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each of the
current and former directors, officers, and employees of the Company and the
Bank and their Subsidiaries, determined as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, an "Indemnified Party"), against any and all costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, amounts paid in settlement, and liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative,
arising out of or relating to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the negotiation, execution, or performance of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at, or after the Effective Time, and based on or pertaining to the
fact that he or she was a director, officer, or employee of the Company or the
Bank or any of their Subsidiaries or was serving at the request of the Company
or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee, or partner of another corporation, partnership, trust, joint
venture, employee benefit plan, or other entity, to the fullest extent such
Indemnified Party would have been entitled to be so indemnified, defended, and
held harmless under the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
governing documents) of the Company and the Bank and their Subsidiaries as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (including the provisions thereof, if
any, relating to the advancement of expenses).

(b)Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
7.9, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation of the same;
provided that the failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Surviving
Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any Liability it
may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually and
materially prejudice the Surviving Corporation (and then only to the extent of
such prejudice). In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation (whether arising before, at, or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that, (A) if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or (B) if counsel for the Indemnified Party advises the Surviving
Corporation in writing that there are legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to those available to the Surviving Corporation
or that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party that make joint representation
inappropriate, the Indemnified Party may retain its own legal counsel and the
Surviving Corporation shall pay, as statements therefor are received, the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party (which
may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction unless there are multiple
Indemnified Parties who have conflicts of interest), (ii) the Indemnified
Party will cooperate in the defense thereof, (iii) the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent, and (iv) the Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation hereunder
in the event a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

(c)Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall obtain, or shall cause the
Bank to obtain, and after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain, a "tail" policy under the Company Parties' existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy providing coverage for a period of six
years immediately after the Effective Time for Persons who are immediately
prior to the Effective Time covered by the Company Parties' existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (the "Tail Insurance"),
which Tail Insurance shall provide for at least the same coverage and coverage
amounts as, and contain terms and conditions not materially less advantageous
than, those currently provided for by the Company Parties' existing directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy; provided, however, that, without the
prior written consent of BancShares, the Company Parties shall not expend for
such Tail Insurance (for said six-year period) an amount in excess of 250% of
the most recent annual premium paid by the Company Parties for their existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy.

(d)In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 7.9.

(e)Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 7.9 are subject
to and conditioned upon their compliance with Section 18(k) of the FDIA (12
U.S.C. § 1828(k)) and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDIC (12
C.F.R. Part 359).

Section 7.10 Estoppel Letters. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
best efforts to obtain and deliver to BancShares prior to or at the Closing a
customary estoppel letter, dated as of the Closing Date, executed by the
lessor of each parcel of Leased Real Property, the form and substance of such
estoppel letters to be satisfactory to BancShares in its reasonable
discretion.

Section 7.11 Proxy Statement.

(a)As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company will prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, which shall
comply with all of the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act
(and the rules and regulations thereunder) applicable thereto. The Company
shall mail the Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock in
advance of the Company Meeting. Except to the extent that the board of
directors of the Company shall have effected a Company Change of
Recommendation as permitted by this Agreement, the Proxy Statement shall
include the Company Board Recommendation. Subject to a Company Change of
Recommendation as permitted by this Agreement, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to: (i) solicit from the holders of Company Common
Stock proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger; and (ii) take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of the holders of Company Common Stock required by applicable
Law. The Company shall keep BancShares, FCB, and Merger Sub updated with
respect to proxy solicitation results as requested by BancShares, FCB, or
Merger Sub. Once the Company Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company
shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting without the consent of
BancShares (other than: (A) in order to obtain a quorum of its shareholders;
or (B) to allow reasonable additional time after the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosures to the Proxy Statement for
compliance with applicable legal requirements). The Company shall have
responsibility for preparing and filing the Proxy Statement, provided that the
Company shall afford BancShares and its legal, financial, and accounting
advisors a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments on (i) the
Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC and (ii) all amendments and
supplements to the Proxy Statement and all responses to requests for
additional information and replies to comments relating to the Proxy Statement
before the same are filed with or submitted to the SEC. The Company, to the
extent permitted by Law, shall deliver to BancShares copies of all material
filings, correspondence, orders, and documents with, to, or from Governmental
Entities, and shall promptly relay to the other Parties the substance of any
material oral communications with, to, or from Governmental Entities, in each
case pertaining or relating to the Proxy Statement or any documents or
materials related thereto.

(b)The Parties shall cooperate in the preparation of the Proxy Statement for
the purpose of submitting this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby to the shareholders of the Company for approval. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of BancShares, FCB, and Merger Sub will
furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in
the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement, at the date that it (and any amendment or
supplement thereto) is first published, sent or given to the shareholders of
the Company, to comply as to form and substance, in all material respects,
with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Each Party covenants and agrees that, in the event
such Party becomes aware of any information furnished by it or any of its
Subsidiaries that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement, or
any other document filed with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, such Party will
promptly inform the other Parties thereof in writing and the Company shall
take all necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement, or other document, as
applicable, including by preparing and mailing to shareholders an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement.

Section 7.12 Exemption from Section 16(b) Liability. BancShares and the
Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those
officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, both prior to and after the Effective Time,
it is desirable that such individuals not be subject to a risk of liability
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in connection with the conversion or exchange of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 7.12. The board of
directors of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as
such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),
shall prior to the Effective Time take all such action as may be reasonably
required to cause to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards that
are treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of the Company who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Section 7.13 Takeover Laws. Neither BancShares or the Company nor their
respective boards of directors shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers, the Bank
Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall
take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) this
Agreement, the Mergers, the Bank Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Law now or hereafter in
effect. If any Takeover Law should become, or should purport to be, applicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Party and its
respective board of directors will grant such approvals and take such other
actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such
Takeover Law. Section 7.14 Litigation and Claims. Each of BancShares and the Company shall
promptly notify the other Party in writing of any action, arbitration,
hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, or other proceeding instituted,
initiated, or commenced, or to the Knowledge of such Party threatened to be
instituted, initiated, or commenced, against such Party or any of its
directors, Subsidiaries, or Affiliates relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of BancShares and the Company shall give
the other Party the opportunity to participate in (but not control), at its
own expense, the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against
such Party or any of its directors, Subsidiaries, or Affiliates relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without such other Party's prior written consent (which consent
shall not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Section 7.15 Operating Functions. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
and as reasonably requested by BancShares, the Company shall, and will cause
the Bank to, cooperate with BancShares and FCB from the date of this Agreement
and to and including the Effective Time in connection with planning for the
efficient and orderly combination of BancShares and the Company and FCB and
the Bank and the operation of the Surviving Corporation and Surviving Bank,
and in preparing for the consolidation of appropriate operating functions,
customer accounts and data, and the conversion of the data processing and
related electronic information technology systems of the Company Parties to
those used by BancShares and FCB, effective as of the Effective Time or such
later date as determined by BancShares. The Company and the Bank each agree to
request consents or approvals of their vendors, service providers and other
third parties that are necessary to give the BancShares Parties access to, or
to permit the Company and the Bank to provide information to the BancShares
Parties, regarding, the business and operations and any contracts of the
Company and the Bank and their data processing systems, subject to FCB's
agreement to enter into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar
agreements with such service providers.

Section 7.16 Trust Preferred Securities. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
BancShares and the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary for
BancShares to, as of the Effective Time, acquire from and succeed to all
rights, title, and interests of the Company in the TPS Trust, including the
issued and outstanding common securities of the TPS Trust, and assume the
Company's covenants, agreements, and obligations under and relating to the
Trust Preferred Securities and the Trust Debentures, in each case in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the TPS Documents.

Section 7.17 Periodic Financial and Other Information. Following the date of
this Agreement and from time to time as indicated below, to and including the
Effective Time, the Company and the Bank will, upon BancShares' or FCB's
reasonable request, promptly provide copies of written materials in the
Company's or the Bank's possession regarding their respective financial
conditions, results of operations, capital, liquidity, Loans, deposits,
interest rate risk reports, credit metrics, meeting minutes (following their
approval by the Board of Directors), credit memoranda, prospects, businesses,
assets, Loan portfolio, investments, properties, employees, or operations as
the Company has historically collected or produced in the ordinary course of
business; provided, that the Company and the Bank shall not be obligated to
provide to BancShares or FCB copies of any such materials pertaining to
BancShares or FCB or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and,
provided further, that the Company and the Bank shall not be obligated to
provide to BancShares or FCB any confidential supervisory information or
materials that it is prohibited by its Governmental Authorities from
disclosing to third parties.

Section 7.18 Payment of SmartFinancial Termination Fee. Substantially
simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, on behalf of the Company,
BancShares shall pay in full the SmartFinancial Termination Fee to

Merger Sub is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement contained herein), in the event of a breach by the
Company of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained in

shareholders of the Company fail to approve, by the requisite vote, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at the Company Meeting,
provided that the Company shall only be entitled to exercise its right of
termination under this Section 9.1(c) if the Company has complied in all
material respects with, and there has been no material breach or violation by
the Company of, its obligations and covenants set forth in Section 7.7.

(d)By either the BancShares Parties or the Company, in the event any approval,
consent, or waiver of or from any Governmental Entity required to consummate

covenants set forth in this Agreement, and that the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its right of termination under this Section 9.1(d) if

other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final,
non-appealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that the BancShares Parties shall not be entitled to exercise their right of
termination under this Section 9.1(e) if such action of such court or other
Governmental Entity shall be due to the failure of the BancShares Parties to
perform or observe their obligations and covenants set forth in this
Agreement, and that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right of
termination under this Section 9.1(e) if such action of such court or other
Governmental Entity shall be due to the failure of the Company to perform or

not consummated by the Outside Date, unless (i) in the event of termination by
the BancShares Parties, the failure to consummate the Merger by such date
shall be due to the failure of the BancShares Parties to perform or observe
their obligations and covenants set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) in the
event of termination by the Company, the failure to consummate the Merger by
such date shall be due to the failure of the Company to perform or observe its
obligations and covenants set forth in this Agreement.

Agreement by the shareholders of the Company in accordance with the Company's
articles of incorporation and bylaws and applicable Law (i) the Company

FORM OF ENTEGRA VOTING AGREEMENT





[attached]



 VOTING AGREEMENT

This Voting Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated April [•], 2019, is entered
into by and between First Citizens BancShares, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("BancShares"), and [•] (the "Shareholder").

R E C I T A L S

A.Concurrently with the parties' execution of this Agreement, BancShares,
First-Citizens Bank and Trust Company, a North Carolina chartered commercial
bank and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of BancShares ("FCB"), FC Merger
Subsidiary VII, Inc., a North Carolina corporation and direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of FCB ("Merger Sub" and together with BancShares and FCB,
collectively, the "BancShares Parties"), and Entegra Financial Corp., a North
Carolina corporation (the "Company"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Merger
Agreement") providing for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with
and into the Company (the "Merger") and the conversion of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (as defined below) into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.

B.As a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, the
BancShares Parties have required that the Shareholder execute and deliver this
Agreement.

C.In order to induce the BancShares Parties to enter into the Merger
Agreement, the Shareholder is willing to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements with respect to the shares of common
stock, no par value, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") "beneficially
owned" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 ("Rule 13d-3") promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) by the Shareholder and identified below the
Shareholder's signature on the signature page to this Agreement (the "Owned
Shares," and together with any additional shares of Company Common Stock or
any other class or series of capital stock of the Company contemplated by
Section 7 hereof, the "Shares").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency, and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

2.Representations of Shareholder. The Shareholder represents and warrants to
BancShares that:

(a)As of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder is the beneficial owner
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3) of the Owned Shares.

(b)As of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder does not beneficially own
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3) any shares of Company Common Stock, or any
shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the Company, other
than the Owned Shares.

(c)The Shareholder has all necessary legal power and authority and legal
capacity to enter into, execute, and deliver this Agreement and to perform
fully the Shareholder's obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes the
legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Shareholder enforceable against
the Shareholder in accordance with its terms.

3.Agreement to Vote Shares. The Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that, during the term of this Agreement as specified in Section 8
below, the Shareholder will vote the Shares, and will cause any holder of
record of the Shares to vote the Shares, (a) in favor of approval of (i) the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, at every meeting
of the shareholders of the Company at which such matters are considered and at
every adjournment or postponement thereof, and (ii) any proposal to adjourn or
postpone any such meeting of the shareholders of the Company, if necessary to
solicit additional proxies (1) to secure the quorum necessary to conduct the
business of such meeting or (2) in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement transactions contemplated thereby, and (b) against (i) any Acquisition
Proposal, and (ii) any action, proposal, transaction, agreement, or other
matter which would or would reasonably be expected to result in a material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or other obligation or
agreement of the Company under the Merger Agreement or of the Shareholder
under this Agreement; provided, however, that, if the manner in which the
Shares (or any portion thereof) are owned is such that the Shareholder does
not have the right to cause the Shares to be so voted, the Shareholder shall
use the Shareholder's best efforts to cause the Shares to be so voted;
provided further, however, that there is no obligation hereunder to exercise
any options or convert any convertible securities in order to obtain the right
to vote any shares of Company capital stock.

4.No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to vest in BancShares any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of
ownership of or with respect to any Shares. All rights, ownership, and
economic benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain with and belong
to the Shareholder.

5.No Voting Trust or Other Arrangement. The Shareholder agrees that the
Shareholder will not, and will not permit any Person under the Shareholder's
control to, deposit any of the Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy with
respect to the Shares inconsistent with the intent of this Agreement, or
subject any of the Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of the
Shares, other than agreements entered into with the BancShares Parties.

6.Transfer and Encumbrance. The Shareholder agrees that, during the term of
this Agreement, the Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly, transfer,
sell, offer, exchange, assign, or otherwise dispose of (collectively,
"Transfer") any of the Shares, or enter into any contract, option, or other
agreement or arrangement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of any of
the Shares or the Shareholder's voting or economic interest therein; provided,
however, that this Section 6 shall not prohibit (i) a Transfer of the Shares
by the Shareholder if, as a precondition to such Transfer, the transferee
agrees in a written instrument, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance
to BancShares, to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement (including
without limitation the provisions of Section 3 hereof pertaining to the voting
of the Shares); (ii) a Transfer of the Shares by will or by operation of law,
in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee; or (iii) a Transfer of
the Shares by the Shareholder to the Company in connection with the vesting,
settlement, or exercise of Company Equity Awards. Any attempted Transfer of
the Shares or any interest therein in violation of this Section 6 shall be
null and void.

7.Additional Shares. The Shareholder agrees that all shares of Company Common
Stock, and all shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the
Company, that the Shareholder purchases, acquires the right to vote (other
than as a named proxy), or otherwise acquires beneficial ownership (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3) of after the Shareholder's execution of this Agreement
(including without limitation any shares of Company capital stock issued as a
dividend or in connection with a stock split or other distribution,
recapitalization, or reclassification or shares issuable upon the conversion,
vesting, settlement, or exercise of any warrant, right, option, restricted
stock, restricted stock unit, or restricted share award, or other security)
shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall constitute "Shares"
for all purposes of this Agreement.

8.Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a)
the approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
by the shareholders of the Company in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company and applicable Law or (b) the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon the
termination of this Agreement, no party hereto shall have any further
obligations or liability hereunder; provided, however, that the termination of
this Agreement shall not relieve a party hereto of any liability for any
breach of this Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement.

9.No Agreement as Director or Officer. The Shareholder makes no agreement or
understanding herein in the Shareholder's capacity as a director or officer of
the Company. The Shareholder has executed this Agreement solely in his or her
capacity as a beneficial owner of the Shares, and nothing in this Agreement
(a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by the Shareholder in
the Shareholder's capacity as such a director or officer, including in
exercising rights under the Merger Agreement, and no such actions or omissions
shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement, or (b) will be construed to prohibit,
limit, or restrict the Shareholder from exercising the Shareholder's fiduciary
duties as a director or officer of the Company.

10.Specific Performance. Each party hereto acknowledges that it will be
impossible to measure in money the damage to the other party if such party
fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed on such party by this
Agreement, that every such obligation is material, and that, in the event of
any such failure, the other party will not have an adequate remedy at law or
adequate damages. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that injunctive relief
or other equitable remedy (including the remedy of specific performance), in
addition to remedies at law and/or damages, is an appropriate remedy for any
such failure and that it will not oppose the seeking of such relief on the
basis that a party has an adequate remedy at law. Each party hereto agrees
that it will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing
or posting of a bond in connection with the other party seeking or obtaining
any such equitable relief or remedy.

11.Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waivers. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire, integrated agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not
be amended or supplemented, and no provisions hereof may be modified or
waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto. No waiver of any provision hereof by a party shall be deemed a waiver
of any other provision hereof by such party, nor shall any such waiver be
deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

12.Disclosure. The Shareholder expressly authorizes BancShares and its
Affiliates and the Company and its Affiliates to publish and disclose in any
announcement, filing, or disclosure required by the SEC, the Proxy Statement,
and any other filings made with a Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, the Shareholder's
identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of the Shareholder's
obligations under this Agreement.

13.Miscellaneous.

(a)This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the Laws of the State of North Carolina, without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
North Carolina or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
Laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of North Carolina.

(b)Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement or the rights and obligations arising hereunder,
brought by the other party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and
determined exclusively in a North Carolina state court located in Raleigh,
Wake County, North Carolina, or the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of North Carolina, Raleigh Division. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submits, with regard to any such action or
proceeding, for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court or tribunal other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, by counterclaim, or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement or the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement or
the rights and obligations arising hereunder, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such courts or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment, or
otherwise), and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (1) the action or proceeding in such courts is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (2) the venue of such action or proceeding is improper, or
(3) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts. (c)EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND, THEREFORE, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE
EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (II) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13(c).

(d)If any term or provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
other jurisdiction. Upon any determination that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby can be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

(e)This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to constitute an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other electronic copy
of a signature page to this Agreement shall be deemed to be, and shall have
the same force and effect as, an original signature page.

(f)All section headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and are not part of this Agreement, and no construction or
reference shall be derived therefrom.

(g)Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, duties, or
obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise, by any party hereto without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any such assignment without such prior written
consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
