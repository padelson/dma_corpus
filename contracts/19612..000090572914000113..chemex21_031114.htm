 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

  



  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Plan of Merger_ ") is made as of
March 10, 2014, by and among Chemical Financial Corporation, a Michigan
corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), WNJ Acquisition Corporation No. 1, a Michigan
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
Northwestern Bancorp, Inc., a Michigan corporation (" _Company_ ").

  

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

  

1.  The respective Boards of Directors of each of Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders that Company and Merger Sub engage in a merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the terms of this Plan of Merger, the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ ") and any other applicable Law; and

  

2.  The Company Board of Directors has, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan of Merger, resolved to adopt this Plan of Merger, to authorize the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by it and to recommend approval by the Company Shareholders of this Plan of Merger; and

  

3.  The Purchaser Board of Directors and the Merger Sub Board of Directors have, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan of Merger, resolved to adopt this Plan of Merger and to authorize the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by it, and the Merger Sub Board of Directors has resolved to recommend approval by the sole shareholder of Merger Sub of this Plan of Merger; and

  

4.  The sole shareholder of Merger Sub has approved this Plan of Merger; and

  

5.  Purchaser has formed Merger Sub for the sole purpose of participating in the Merger. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the existence of Merger Sub be disregarded and the Merger be treated as a purchase by Purchaser of all of the outstanding capital stock of Company; and

  

6.  All of the members of the Company Board of Directors have executed and delivered to Purchaser a voting agreement substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_.

  

In consideration of the representations, warranties, mutual covenants and
agreements contained in this Plan of Merger, the parties agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

  

1.1   _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan of
Merger, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.
Company and Merger Sub are each sometimes referred to as a " _Constituent
Corporation_ " prior to the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
Constituent Corporations shall become a single corporation, which corporation
shall be Company (the

   
     
--- 

 


--- 

    

" _Surviving Corporation_ "). The effect of the Merger upon each of the
Constituent Corporations and the Surviving Corporation shall be as provided in
Chapter Seven of the MBCA with respect to the merger of domestic
corporations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject to the MBCA, at the Effective Time: (a) all the rights, privileges,
powers, franchises, licenses, and interests in and to every type of property
(whether real, personal, or mixed) of Company and Merger Sub, shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, (b) all choses in action of Company and Merger Sub
shall continue unaffected and uninterrupted by the Merger and shall accrue to
the Surviving Corporation, and (c) all debts, liabilities and duties of
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

1.2   _The Closing_. The parties shall consummate the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") (a) at the offices of Warner Norcross and Judd LLP in Grand
Rapids, Michigan, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by
Company or Purchaser upon five Business Days\' written notice (or, at the
election of Purchaser, on the last Business Day of the month in which the
Closing would occur in accordance with this _Section 1.2_ ) after the last of
the conditions to Closing contained in _Article VI_ (other than any
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) is
satisfied or waived in accordance with this Plan of Merger, or (b) at such
other place and time or on such other date as Company and Purchaser
may mutually determine (the date on which the Closing actually occurs is
referred to as the " _Closing Date_ "). Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, Purchaser may at its option delay the Closing to the last Business
Day of the month following the month in which the date first specified by
Company pursuant to this section occurs if such delay is considered by
Purchaser to be necessary to prevent the Closing from occurring during a
month in which a calendar quarter ends. Scheduling or commencing the Closing
shall not, however, constitute a waiver of the respective conditions precedent
of the parties set forth in _Article VI_.

  

1.3   _Effective Time of Merger_. Upon completion of the Closing,
the parties shall promptly execute and file a certificate of merger as
required by the MBCA to effect the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ").
No party shall take any action to revoke the Certificate of Merger after its
filing without the written consent of the other party. The " _Effective Time_
" of the Merger shall be the time and date when the Merger becomes effective
as set forth in the Certificate of Merger, which may be the last day of the
month in which the Closing occurs.

  

1.4   _Additional Actions_. At any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation may determine that deeds, assignments, or
assurances or any other acts are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect, or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its rights,
title, or interest in, to, or under any of the rights, properties, or assets
of Company and Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or
to otherwise carry out the purposes of this Plan of Merger. Company and
Merger Sub grant to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of
attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments, and assurances
and to do all acts necessary, proper, or convenient to accomplish this
purpose. This irrevocable power of attorney shall only be operative following
the Effective Time and at such time the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized in the name of Company
and Merger Sub to take any and all such actions contemplated by this Plan of
Merger.

  

   
     
--- 

 


--- 

    

1.5   _Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall have the following attributes until they are subsequently
changed in the manner provided by Law:

  

1.5.1   _Name_. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"Northwestern Bancorp, Inc."

  

1.5.2   _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the articles of
incorporation of Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, without change.

  

1.5.3   _Bylaws_. The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
be the bylaws of Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, without change.

  

1.5.4   _Officers_. The officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time.

  

1.5.5   _Directors_. The directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time.

  

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

2.1   _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties or any
other Person:

  

2.1.1   _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by Company (or by any of its wholly-
owned Subsidiaries) or Purchaser (or by any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub)) (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ _,_ "
_provided_ , _however_ , that Excluded Shares shall not include Trust Account
Shares or DPC Shares as defined in this Plan of Merger) immediately before
the Effective Time will automatically be canceled and cease to exist without
delivery of any consideration in exchange for or in respect of any Excluded
Share.

  

2.1.2   _Merger Consideration_. All shares of Company Common
Stock and all Options issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive an aggregate amount of cash equal to One Hundred Twenty Million
Dollars ($120,000,000), subject to rounding as provided in _Section 2.1.3_ and
adjustment as provided in _Section 2.10_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  

2.1.3   _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount of cash, rounded to the nearest penny, determined by the
following formula (the " _Cash Consideration Per Share_ "):

  



  

CCPS = (MC + A) / (B + C)

  



  

   
     
--- 

 


--- 

    

Where:

  



  

CCPS equals the Cash Consideration Per Share;

  



  

MC equals the Merger Consideration, as adjusted as required by _Section 2.10_
;

  



  

A equals the aggregate dollar amount of the exercise prices under all Options
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;

  



  

B equals the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

  



  

C equals the total number of Options issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

  



  

No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_.

  

2.1.4   _No Conversion of Purchaser\'s Common Stock_. Each share
of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Purchaser, continue as
one share of common stock of Purchaser. Outstanding certificates representing
shares of common stock of Purchaser shall be deemed to represent an identical
number of shares of common stock of Purchaser.

  

2.1.5   _Company Common Stock No Longer Outstanding_. Each share
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, as of the Effective Time, no longer be outstanding and each certificate
previously representing such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Cash Consideration Per Share.

  

2.1.6   _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of
common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into one fully-
paid and non-assessable share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

2.2  Stock Plans.

  

2.2.1   _Conversion of Options._ Company and Purchaser shall
take all requisite action so that, as of the Effective Time, each option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Plan (each, an
" _Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent an Option and shall
be cashed out by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of that Option into an amount of cash for each share of Company
Common Stock subject to the Option equal to (x) the Cash Consideration Per
Share minus (y) the amount of the exercise price per share of the Option.

  

   
     
--- 

 


--- 

    

2.2.2   _No Restriction on Purchaser Common Stock._ Nothing
contained in this Plan of Merger shall preclude Purchaser from amending its
articles of incorporation to change its capital structure or from issuing
additional shares of Purchaser Common Stock, preferred stock, shares of other
capital stock or securities that are convertible into shares of capital stock.

  

2.3  Surrender of Shares.

  

2.3.1   _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to or at the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit with Computershare Investor Services,
LLC, or another bank or trust company designated by Purchaser and reasonably
satisfactory to Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether represented by Certificates or held as Book-Entry Shares, and as
necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, cash in an aggregate
amount sufficient to make payments of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1.2._ All such cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to
this _Section 2.3.1_ is referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

  

2.3.2   _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares), as of the Effective Time, a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery will be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will pass,
only upon proper delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Cash Consideration Per
Share. __

  

2.3.3   _Consideration Upon Surrender._ Upon surrender of a
Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, each holder of a Certificate or
of Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash
representing the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration Per Share to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1.3,_ and such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled.

  

2.3.4   _Unregistered Transfers._ In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of Company, payment of the Cash Consideration Per Share may be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered are registered if the Certificates are properly endorsed
or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
transfer or establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser, that such
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by _Section 2.3.3_ , each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Cash Consideration Per Share.

  

   
     
--- 

 


--- 

    

2.3.5   _Exchange Agent Discretion._ The Exchange Agent shall
have discretion to determine and apply reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to conduct an orderly exchange of unsurrendered
Certificates for the Merger Consideration.

  

2.4   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Purchaser,
upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have
not then complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Purchaser for, and Purchaser shall remain liable for, payment of their claims
for the Cash Consideration Per Share, in accordance with this _Article II_.

  

2.5   _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration shall be deemed to have been in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock formerly represented by
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the close of business on the Closing
Date, the share transfer books of Company shall be closed, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of Company
of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
to shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Plan
of Merger or by applicable Law.

  

2.6   _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, none of Company, Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent will be liable to any Company Shareholder or any other Person
in respect of any cash properly delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by Company Shareholders as of a date
that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Purchaser free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

2.7   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, Purchaser or the Exchange
Agent will, upon the receipt of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of
such Certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Cash Consideration Per Share payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock previously evidenced by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of the Cash Consideration Per Share, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as Purchaser or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Purchaser or the
Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate.

  

2.8   _Withholding Rights_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of

   
     
--- 

 


--- 

    

such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited
with the relevant Governmental Entity by Purchaser, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Plan of Merger as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Purchaser.

  

2.9   _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Purchaser from time to
time provided that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable or
the timing of the amounts payable to Company Shareholders pursuant to this
_Article II_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as
set forth herein. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be for Purchaser\'s account.

  

2.10   _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time,
the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted, if applicable, as follows (which
Merger Consideration, as adjusted as provided below, shall become the "Merger
Consideration" for purposes of this Plan of Merger and, without
limitation, for purposes of _Section 2.1.3_ ):

  

2.10.1   _Shareholders\' Equity Price Adjustment._ If, as of the
Final Statement Date, the Company Consolidated Shareholders\' Equity is less
than $65,000,000, the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal
to (a) $65,000,000 minus (b) the Company Consolidated Shareholders\' Equity

3.19.21  Neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability
to any governmental or regulatory body with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan or any related trust, account or other funding vehicle. Neither Company
nor any Company Subsidiary owes premiums to the PBGC that are due but unpaid

Proposal and (c) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board
of Directors shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Plan of
Merger proposed in writing by Purchaser, and shall have determined that the

Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect. In the event of any
material revisions to a Company Takeover Proposal that could have an impact,
influence or other effect on the Company Board of Directors\' decision or
discussion with respect to whether such proposal is a Company
Superior Proposal, Company shall deliver a new written notice to Purchaser
pursuant to the foregoing clause (a) and again comply with the requirements

Shareholders if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board of
Directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the taking of any action pursuant to any of the preceding clauses (a),
(b) or (c) shall in no way limit or modify the effect of this Plan of Merger

--- 

 


--- 

    

consummation of a transaction more favorable to the Company Shareholders from
a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account (a) all legal,
regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal (including availability of
financing and certainty of closing) and the Person making the proposal; and

expenses provisions that are no less favorable to officers and directors than
those set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organization documents of Company and the Company Subsidiaries in
effect immediately prior to the date of this Plan of Merger, and, subject to
compliance with applicable Law, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights

benefit of Company or any Company Subsidiary, including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger; _provided, however_ ,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the foregoing shall not
limit the rights provided in the first sentence of _Section 5.9.1_. All
rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses in respect of any Action
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. In the event of

insurance coverages in excess of 300% of the last annual premium (such 300%
threshold, the " _Maximum Amount_ ") paid by Company prior to the date of
this Plan of Merger in respect of the coverages required to be obtained
pursuant to this _Section 5.9.3_ , but in such case shall purchase the

--- 

 


--- 

    

Corporation may purchase at or after the Effective Time, at a total aggregate
cost not exceeding the Maximum Amount, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on
terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the
current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by

documents of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the MBCA, directors\' and
officers\' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to Company or the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise.

the Indemnified Parties, each of whom is a third-party beneficiary of this
_Section 5.9_.

successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, in each case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

  

5.9.6  Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, the
indemnification obligations in this _Section 5.9_ are limited by federal
banking and securities laws and any such obligations that violate any federal
banking or securities laws or published public policy are void and
unenforceable.
