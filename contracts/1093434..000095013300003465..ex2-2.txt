1.      Borrowings:

        The aggregate of all amounts borrowed by any Group Company (from

        Company has received notice from any lenders of money requiring
        repayment or intimating the enforcement of any security and so far as
        CILT is aware there are no current circumstances in existence as at the

H.      INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

1.      A Group Company is the sole legal and beneficial owner free from
        Encumbrances of the Listed Intellectual Property and (where such Listed
        Intellectual Property is registered) the registered proprietor thereof
        and owns no other registered or material unregistered Intellectual
        Property.

2.      Save as may appear from the Listed Intellectual Property Agreements no
        person has been authorised to make any use whatsoever of any
        Intellectual Property owned by any Group Company.

3.      Save as may appear from the Listed Intellectual Property Agreements a
        Group Company owns all the material Intellectual Property that any Group
        Company uses.

4.      All the Intellectual Property rights owned or used by any Group Company
        are valid and enforceable and nothing has been done, omitted or
        permitted whereby any of them has ceased or might cease to be valid and
        enforceable. So far as CILT is aware none of the processes or products
        of any Group Company infringes any Intellectual Property of any other
        person in circumstances which might entitle that person to make a claim
        against the relevant Group Company.

5.      So far as CILT is aware, none of the Listed Intellectual Property is the
        subject of any claims or proceedings for opposition or contested
        ownership.

6.      CILT is not aware of any infringement of the Listed Intellectual
        Property or of any rights relating to it by any person.

7.      There are no outstanding claims against any Group Company for
        infringement of any Intellectual Property used (or which have been used)
        by any Group Company and no such claims have been settled by the giving
        of any undertakings which remain in force. No Group Company has received
        any actual or threatened claim that any of the Listed Intellectual
        Property rights is invalid nor are the Sellers aware of any reason why
        any granted patents included in the Listed Intellectual Property should
        be amended.

8.      Confidential information and know-how used by any Group Company is kept
        confidential. No Group Company has disclosed (except in the ordinary
        course of its business or under the Listed Intellectual Property
        Agreements) any of its know-how, trade secrets or lists of customers to
        any other person.

9.      Such of the Listed Intellectual Property as is registered has been
        maintained and all application and renewal fees for such registered
        Intellectual Property have been duly paid on time.

10.     The Listed Intellectual Property Agreements are all the material
        Intellectual Property agreements to which any Group Company is a party;
        each of them is valid and binding; and no Group Company is in material
        breach of any of the provisions of

                                      -51-


<PAGE>   55
        such agreements.

11.     All persons retained or employed by any Group Company who, in the
        course of their work for such Group Company will or might reasonably
        be expected to bring into existence Intellectual Property or things
        protected by Intellectual Property are, so far as is reasonably
        practicable, individually bound by agreements with the relevant Group
        Company whereby all Intellectual Property which such persons may bring
        into existence during their work for a Group Company vests in the
        relevant Group Company. All such agreements contain terms which, so
        far as is reasonably practicable, prevent such persons disclosing any
        confidential information about the relevant Group Company and its
        business.

12.     None of the Intellectual Property owned by any Group Company is subject
        to compulsory licensing or the granting of any licences of right nor, so
        far as CILT is aware, will it become so by operation of law.

13.     Data Protection:

        Each Group Company is registered and has otherwise complied in all
        material respects with the requirements of all applicable data
        protection legislation.

14.     Marketing and Other Promotional Material:

        So far as the CILT is aware, all current advertising, marketing and
        sales promotions by any Group Company comply with all applicable laws,
        regulations, codes of practice and self-regulatory schemes. No Group
        Company has been disciplined under any law, regulation, scheme or code
        in respect of any such advertising, marketing or sales promotion; no
        complaint has been made against it in respect of such advertising,
        marketing or sales promotion; and there are no outstanding complaints or
        disciplinary proceedings against any Group Company in respect of such
        advertising, marketing or sales promotion.

15.     Identification and ownership of Information Technology:

   a.   Particulars of all material IT Systems and all material IT Contracts are
        disclosed in the Disclosure Letter.

   b.   Save as disclosed in the Disclosure Letter, all material IT Systems are
        controlled by the Group, and are not wholly or partly dependent on any
        facilities or services not under the exclusive control of a Group
        Company.

   c.   So far as CILT is aware, all the IT Contracts are valid and binding.
        None of the IT Contracts has been the subject of any material breach or
        default, or is liable to be terminated or otherwise adversely affected
        by the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

   d.   The Group has in its possession or in its control the source code of all
        Software owned by any Group Company.

   a.   All IT Services are being and have been provided in accordance with all
        applicable specifications.

        transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

   c.   So far as CILT is aware no person has had unauthorised access to the IT
        Systems or any data stored thereon. Each Group Company operates a
        documented procedure, and has taken reasonable steps to avoid infections
        by viruses and unauthorised access.

   d.   All material data processed using the IT Systems and/or the IT Services
        has been regularly archived in hard copy form. Such hard copies have
        been properly stored and catalogued.

   e.   Each Group Company has taken reasonable steps to ensure that its
        business can continue in the event of a failure of the IT Systems
        (whether due to natural disaster, power failure or otherwise).

   f.   The Group has sufficient technically competent and trained employees to
        ensure proper handling, operation, monitoring and use of the IT Systems.

        Each Group Company has filed all Tax returns which are required to be
        filed in respect of such Group Company and has paid all Tax which has
        become due pursuant to such Tax returns or pursuant to any assessment
        which has become payable; all such Tax returns are complete and accurate
        in all material respects and disclose all Taxes required to be paid by
        the relevant Group Company.

        During the last six years no Group Company has received notice of any
        action, suit, non-routine investigation, audit, claim, lien or
        assessment pending or proposed or threatened with respect to Tax, and so
        far as CILT is aware no basis exists therefor and neither the Sellers
        nor any Group Company have waived or been requested to waive any statute
        of limitations in respect of Tax associated with such Group Company.

2.      Provisions:

        The Accounts make full provision or reserve for all Tax for which any
        Group Company is accountable at the Accounts Date whether or not any
        Group Company has or might have any right of reimbursement against any
        other person.

        Proper provision has been made and shown in the Accounts for deferred
        Tax in accordance with GAAP.

(a)     During the last six years each Group Company has properly deducted Tax,
        including social security and other payroll Tax, as required by
        applicable law from all payments to, or to be treated as made to, or
        benefits provided for, or to be treated as provided for, employees or
        ex-employees of such Group Company.

(b)     During the last six years each Group Company has duly accounted to the
        Tax Authorities for sums so deducted (or has made proper reserve or
        provision for such payments in the Accounts); and each Group Company has

4.      Sales at undervalue/overvalue and Deductions:

(a)     All of the transactions of each Group Company have been entered into on
        an arm's length basis, and the consideration charged or received or paid
        by the relevant Group Company on all transactions entered into by it has
        been equal to the consideration that might have been expected to be
        charged received or paid (as appropriate) between independent persons
        dealing at arm's length.

                                      -55-

7.      Tax Schemes; Compliance:

        No Group Company has entered into or been a party to or otherwise

        purpose of avoiding, evading or deferring Tax which is contrary to law.

8.      Value Added Tax:

        Each Group Company:

(a)     is a registered taxable person for the purpose of applicable value added
        tax regulations [and has not at any time been treated as a member of a
        group of companies for such purpose and has not made any application to

                2.2.2.  it would not have arisen but for a change in

                        part);

                        Warranties;

                2.2.5.  such liability is in respect of or by reference to
                        income, profits or gains earned, or arises in
                        consequence of an Event occurring, since the Accounts

                        Company;

                        omission or transaction carried out or effected under a
                        legally binding commitment created on or before
                        Completion or carried out or effected in the ordinary
                        course of business of a Group Company as carried on at
                        Completion.

                2.2.7.

                        a)      such liability arises by virtue of any claim,
                                election, surrender or disclaimer made or notice
                                or consent given after Completion by a Group
                                Company or the Purchaser (including the
                                disclaimer of the whole or part of any
                                industrial building or other capital allowances
                                under the provisions of any Taxation Statute)
                                other than where the making, giving or doing of
                                which was taken into account in the preparation
                                of the Accounts;

                        b)      such liability would not have arisen or would
                                have been reduced but for a failure or omission
                                on the part of the Purchaser or a Group Company
                                after Completion to make any election, claim,
                                surrender or disclaimer, or give any notice or
                                consent or do any other thing, in relation to
                                Taxation, the anticipated making giving or doing
                                of which was taken into account in computing any
                                provision or reserve for Taxation in the
                                Accounts;

                        c)      such liability would not have arisen but for a
                                cessation of, or any change in the nature or
                                conduct of, any trade carried on by a Group
                                Company, being a cessation or change occurring
                                on or after Completion;

                2.2.8.  such liability has been made good by insurers or
                        otherwise compensated for without cost to the Purchaser
                        or a Group Company;

                                      -67-


<PAGE>   71


                2.2.9.  such liability is in respect of stamp duty reserve tax
                        payable on the transfer or agreement to transfer the
                        Shares pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement;

                2.2.10. such liability is attributable to a Group Company
                        ceasing to be entitled to the small companies' rate of
                        corporation tax whether by virtue of an increase in the
                        level of profits for the accounting period during which
                        Completion takes place that are attributable to the
                        period following Completion or by virtue of an increase
                        in the number of associated companies of a Group Company
                        after Completion;

                2.2.11. such liability arises or is increased as a consequence
                        of any failure by the Purchaser to comply with its
                        obligations under this Deed including for the avoidance
                        of doubt its obligations to procure that a Group Company
                        carries out any act or does anything;

                2.2.12. such liability could have been extinguished or reduced
                        by the use of any Relief in respect of any Tax which
                        existed at Completion and which was not shown as an
                        asset in the Accounts and was not taken into account in
                        computing any provision or reserve for Taxation
                        (including deferred Tax) in the Accounts;

                2.2.13. any income, profits or gains to which such liability is
                        attributable were earned or received by, or accrued to,
                        a Group Company but were not reflected in the Accounts;

3.      Gross-up: All sums payable by the Covenantor under this Deed shall be
        paid free and clear of all deductions or withholdings (including Tax)
        unless the deduction or withholding is required by law, in which event,
        or in the event that the Purchaser shall incur any liability for Tax
        chargeable or assessable in respect of any payment pursuant to this
        Deed, the Covenantor shall pay such additional amounts as shall be
        required to ensure that the net amount received by the Purchaser will
        equal the full amount which would have been received by it had no such
        deduction or withholding been made and/or no such liability to Tax been
        incurred and:-

        3.1.    (a)  in applying this Clause 2.3 no account shall be taken of
                the extent to which any liability for Tax may be mitigated or
                offset by any Relief or repayment available to the Purchaser, if
                such Relief or repayment would otherwise have been used to
                mitigate or offset any other liability for Tax of the Purchaser
                or any holding company of the Purchaser or any subsidiary of any
                such holding company; and

        3.2.    (b)  if, following the payment of an additional amount under
                this Clause 2.3, the Purchaser subsequently obtains a saving in
                Tax or a repayment or credit in respect of the deduction,
                withholding or liability for Tax giving rise to such amount, the
                Purchaser shall pay to the Covenantor a sum equal to the amount
                of such repayment or saving (in both cases to the extent only of

                                      -68-


<PAGE>   72


                the said additional amount) such payment to be made within 10
                days of the receipt of the repayment or the reduction of Tax due
                and payable, as the case may be.

4.      Timing:

        4.1.    Where the Covenantor becomes liable to make any payment pursuant
                to Clause 2, the due date for the making of that payment shall
                be within 20 days after the date on which notice setting out the
                amount of Tax due accompanied by reasonably satisfactory
                evidence from the auditors of the Company that the amount
                demanded is due and payable is received from the Purchaser in
                accordance with Clause 4 of this Deed or, if later:-

                4.1.1.  insofar as the claim arises under Clause 2.1(a), the day
                        before the day on which a payment of Tax becomes finally
                        due under the Claim for Tax in question or the day
                        before the day on which any repayment (or increased
                        repayment) of Tax (which but for such Claim for Tax
                        would have been available) would have been due;

                4.1.2.  insofar as the claim arises under Clause 2.1(b), the day
                        before the day on which payment of Taxation would have
                        been finally due from the relevant Group Company had the
                        Liability for Tax therein mentioned been satisfied by
                        the relevant Group Company by payment rather than by
                        Utilisation of Relief and for this purpose it shall be
                        assumed that the Claim for Tax would have been made and
                        all Tax would have become due at the latest date on
                        which payment could have been made without incurring
                        interest, penalties or fines for late payment; and

                4.1.3.  insofar as the claim arises pursuant to Clause 2.1(c),
                        the day before the day on which the costs and expenses
                        fall due for payment.

        4.2.    For the purpose of this Clause, no payment shall be treated as
                having been made until it has been received by the Purchaser in
                cleared funds.

        4.3.    If any sum due under Clause 2 is not paid by the Covenantor by
                the due date, the same shall carry interest (from such date
                until the date of payment) at the rate of two per cent over the
                base rate for the time being of Lloyds Bank plc (or, in the
                absence of such rate, at such equivalent rate as the Purchaser
                shall select).

5.      Time Limit:

        5.1.    The liability of the Covenantor to make any payment under this
                Deed shall cease on the second anniversary of the date of this
                Deed except: (a) in respect of any claim of which the Purchaser
                gives notice to the Covenantor before that date specifying (in
                reasonable detail) the nature of the claim and the amount of Tax
                claimed and any such claim which may be made shall (if

                                      -69-


<PAGE>   73


                it has not previously been satisfied, settled or withdrawn) be
                deemed to be withdrawn at the expiration of 6 months from the
                date of giving notice of such claim unless legal proceedings in
                respect thereof have been commenced by issuing and service or
                such proceedings against the Covenantor, or (b) in respect of
                any Claim for Tax alleging fraudulent conduct.

6.      Corresponding Benefit:

        6.1.    If the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company is or may be
                entitled to recover from a person (including any Tax authority)
                a sum in respect of any Claim for Tax which gives rise to a
                liability on the part of the Covenantor under this Deed, then:

                6.1.1.  the Purchaser shall give the Covenantor details of the
                        entitlement as soon as practicable;

                6.1.2.  the Purchaser shall at the request of the Covenantor and
                        at the Covenantor's expense having been indemnified and
                        secured to the Purchaser's satisfaction take all
                        appropriate steps to recover or to procure the recovery
                        of the sum, keeping the Covenantor fully informed of the
                        progress of any action taken;

                6.1.3.  the Purchaser shall within 14 days of recovery of any
                        sum, pay that sum to the Covenantor so far as it does
                        not exceed any payments already made by the Covenantor
                        in respect of the relevant Claim for Tax and pay to the
                        Covenantor any interest or repayment supplement received
                        in respect of that sum so far as paid to the Covenantor;
                        and

                6.1.4.  so far as not so repaid or paid, the amount of the sum
                        recovered (including any interest or repayment
                        supplement) shall be set against the liability of the
                        Covenantor in respect of the relevant Claim for Tax.

7.      Resistance of Claims:

        7.1.    If the Purchaser becomes aware of any Claim for Tax which may
                result in the Purchaser having a claim against the Covenantor
                under this Deed, the Purchaser shall give or procure that
                written notice is given to the Covenantor in the manner provided
                in Clause 4 of this Deed as soon as is reasonably practicable
                and no later than 10 days after becoming aware of the claim and
                the Covenantor shall, except in the case of fraud on the part of
                the Covenantor, be entitled at their sole discretion (but after
                consultation with the Purchaser) to resist such Claim for Tax in
                the name of the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company or any
                of them but at the expense of the Covenantor and to have the
                conduct of any appeal or incidental negotiations PROVIDED THAT:-

                                      -70-


<PAGE>   74


                7.1.1.  the relevant Group Company and the Purchaser shall be
                        kept fully informed of all matters pertaining to the
                        dispute; and

                7.1.2.  no material communication, written or otherwise,
                        pertaining to the dispute (and in particular no proposal
                        for or consent to any settlement or compromise thereof)
                        shall be transmitted to any Tax Authority or any other
                        taxation authorities or governmental body or authority
                        without the same having been submitted to, and approved
                        by, the Purchaser and the relevant Group Company; and

                7.1.3.  no application shall be made for postponement of Tax
                        unless the Purchaser and the relevant Group Company
                        shall be provided with such security as they may
                        reasonably require in respect of sums subsequently
                        becoming payable under this Deed.

        7.2.    The Purchaser shall procure that the relevant Group Company
                shall give the Covenantor reasonable co-operation, access and
                assistance, technical or otherwise, for the purpose of resisting
                such a Claim for Tax and shall provide such assistance as the
                Covenantor may reasonably require and all such information as
                may be available to the Purchaser at the relevant Group Company
                for avoiding, disputing, resisting, appealing or compromising or
                contesting any Claim for Tax provided that:-

                7.2.1.  the Covenantor shall not commence any proceedings beyond
                        a court of first instance with respect to a Claim for
                        Tax unless they have been advised by specialist Tax
                        Counsel selected by agreement between the Purchaser and
                        the Covenantor (or in default of agreement, selected by
                        the President for the time being of the Law Society,
                        after disclosure of all relevant information and
                        documents, that it is reasonable to resist the Claim for
                        Tax in the manner proposed by the Covenantor; and

                7.2.2.  the Covenantor reimburse the Purchaser an amount equal
                        to all reasonable costs and expenses which may thereby
                        be incurred.

8.      Over-provisions:

        8.1.    If the auditors for the time being of a Group Company shall
                certify (at the request and expense of the Covenantor) that any
                provision for Taxation in the Accounts has proved to be an
                over-provision then the amount of such over-provision shall be
                dealt with in accordance with clause 7.3.

        8.2.    If the auditors for the time being of a Group Company shall
                certify (at the request and expense of the Covenantor) that any
                Liability for Taxation which has resulted in a payment having
                been made or becoming due from the Covenantor under this Deed
                has given or will give rise to a corresponding saving for a
                Group Company which would not otherwise have arisen then as and
                when the liability of the Company to make an actual payment of
                or in

                                      -71-


<PAGE>   75


                respect of Taxation is reduced by reason of the utilisation of
                that corresponding saving the amount by which that liability for
                Taxation is so reduced shall be dealt with in accordance with
                clause 7.3.

        8.3.    Where it is provided under clause 7.1 or 7.2 above that any
                amount (the "Relevant Amount") is to be dealt with in accordance
                with this clause 7.3:

                8.3.1.  the Relevant Amount shall first be set off against any
                        payment then due from the Covenantor under this Deed;
                        and

                8.3.2.  to the extent there is an excess refund should be made
                        to the Covenantor of any previous payment or payments
                        made by the Covenantor under this Deed and not
                        previously refunded under this clause up to the amount
                        of such excess; and

                8.3.3.  to the extent that the excess referred in clause 7.3.2
                        above is not exhausted the remainder of that excess
                        shall be carried forward and set off against any future
                        payment or payments which become due from the Covenantor
                        under this Deed

        8.4.    Where any such certification as is mentioned in clause 7.1 or
                7.2 above has been made the Covenantor or the Purchaser or a
                Group Company may request the auditors of a Group Company for
                the time being at the expense of the parties so making the
                request to review such certification in the light of all
                relevant circumstances including any facts which have become
                known only since such certification and to certify whether such
                certification remains correct or whether in the light of those
                circumstances the amount that was the subject of such
                certification should be amended.

        8.5.    If the auditors certify under clause 7.5 above that an amount
                previously certified should be amended that amended amount
                should be substituted for the purposes of clause 7.3 as the
                Relevant Amount in respect of the certification in question in
                place of the amount originally certified and such adjusting
                payment (if any) as may be required by virtue of the
                aforementioned substitution shall be made as soon as practicable
                by the Covenantor or (as the case may be) to the Covenantor.

        8.6.    The Purchaser undertakes to supply, and undertakes to procure
                that the Company shall supply, to the Purchaser and subsequently
                to any firm of accountants nominated to deal with any such

                Covenantor) all documents accounts notices papers and other
                necessary information as may be reasonably required for the
                purpose of making any such determination as to whether there is
                or has been any over-provision or a corresponding saving for the
                purposes of this clause 7.

        9.2.    Clauses 6 (Resistance of claims) and 3 (timing) shall apply to

                agents to prepare the tax returns and computations of a Group
                Company for all accounting periods ended on or before the
                Accounts Date and conduct matters relating to them in accordance
                with this clause 9.

                            LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

1.      APPLICABILITY OF THIS SCHEDULE

        The provisions of this Schedule shall apply with respect to the
        Warranties and (only to the extent expressly so stated in this Schedule)
        to the other provisions of this Agreement and to the Tax Deed (in
        addition to the limitations (if any) set out in those documents
        respectively).

2.      WARRANTIES

        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
        provisions of this Schedule shall operate to limit the liability of CILT
        in respect of any claim under the Warranties by the Purchaser (a
        "Warranty Claim").

3.      LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THE WARRANTIES AND THE TAX DEED

        3.1.    Limitation on quantum:

                3.1.1.  Save in the event of fraud on the part of CILT:

                        a)      The total liability of CILT under or pursuant to
                                this Agreement (whether for breach of the
                                Warranties (other than the Tax Warranties and
                                the Tax Deed) shall not exceed the lesser of:-

                                (1)     US$17,000,000; and

                                (2)     after the first anniversary of
                                        Completion, US$8,500,000 plus a sum
                                        equal to any liability of CILT in
                                        respect of any such claims notified in
                                        accordance with paragraph C2 by the
                                        Purchaser to CILT on or prior to the
                                        first anniversary of Completion.

                        b)      The total liability of CILT under or pursuant to
                                the Tax Warranties and the Tax Deed shall not
                                exceed US$8,500,000.

                        c)      CILT shall not be liable in respect of any
                                individual claim under the Warranties (other
                                than Warranties C1(b) and D7 or the Tax
                                Warranties) unless (and then only to the extent
                                that) the amount that would otherwise be
                                recoverable from CILT in respect of such claim
                                exceeds US$20,000. For the avoidance of doubt,
                                amounts for which the CILT has no liability, or
                                by which the CILT's liability is reduced as a
                                consequence of the operation of this clause
                                shall not be capable of constituting a claim or
                                increasing the amount thereof for the purpose of
                                paragraph 3.1.1(d).

                        d)      CILT shall not be liable in respect of any claim
                                or claims under the Warranties other than the
                                Tax Warranties unless and until (and then in
                                respect of all such claims) the aggregate amount
                                that would otherwise be recoverable from CILT in
                                respect of all such claims (after disregarding
                                such part of such claims as is necessary to
                                comply with paragraph 3.1.1(c) shall exceed
                                US$250,000.

                        e)      CILT shall not be liable in respect of any claim
                                or claims under the Tax Warranties or the Tax
                                Deed unless and until (and then in respect of
                                all such claims) the aggregate amount that would
                                otherwise be recoverable from CILT in respect of
                                all such claims shall exceed US$75,000

                3.1.2.  For the purpose of paragraph 3.1.1, where a claim
                        relates to more than one event, circumstance, act or
                        omission which event, circumstance, act or omission
                        would separately constitute a breach of or give rise to
                        a Warranty Claim or a claim under the Tax Deed, such
                        claim shall be treated as a separate claim in respect of
                        each such event, circumstance, act or omission.

                3.1.3.  The amount of any claim(s) under the Warranties in
                        respect of any particular matter or circumstance shall
                        be counted only once, so that the Purchaser shall not be
                        entitled to aggregate any claims which it may make (or
                        be entitled to make) under this Agreement and/or the Tax
                        Deed.

                3.1.4.  Nothing in this Schedule shall in any way restrict or
                        limit the general obligation of the Purchaser to
                        mitigate any loss or damage which it may suffer in
                        consequence of any breach by CILT of the Warranties.

                3.1.5.  the avoidance of doubt, in determining the amount of any
                        claim for the purposes of the limits set out in this
                        Schedule, the amount of such claim shall be the net
                        amount after giving effect to all the provisions of this
                        Schedule.

        3.2.    Time limits for bringing claim:

        No claim shall be brought against CILT in respect of any breach of the
        Warranties or the Tax Deed unless the Purchaser shall have given to CILT
        written notice of such claim specifying (in reasonable detail) the
        matter which gives rise to the breach or claim, the nature of the breach
        or claim and the Purchaser's good faith estimate of the amount claimed
        in respect thereof on or before the date of the second anniversary of
        Completion;

        PROVIDED that the liability of CILT under this sub-paragraph shall
        absolutely determine (if such claim has not been previously satisfied,
        settled or withdrawn) if legal proceedings in respect of such claim
        shall not have been commenced

                                      -80-


<PAGE>   84


        within six months of the service of such notice and for this purpose
        proceedings shall not be deemed to have been commenced unless they shall
        have been properly issued and validly served upon CILT.

        3.3.    Conduct of litigation:

                3.3.1.  If the Purchaser considers that it will or may make a
                        claim against CILT for breach of Warranty, it shall as
                        soon as practicable notify CILT in writing, giving such
                        particulars thereof as are then available, and for a
                        period of 30 days after such notification shall afford
                        CILT the opportunity to take steps to remedy the matter
                        giving rise to such claim. To the extent that the matter
                        giving rise to such claim is remedied within such 30
                        days period, the Purchaser shall not be entitled to any
                        compensation in respect thereof.

                3.3.2.  Upon the Purchaser becoming aware of any claim, action
                        or demand against it or matter likely to give rise to
                        any of these in respect of the Warranties, the Purchaser
                        shall, subject to paragraph 15 of this Schedule:-

                        a)      forthwith notify CILT by written notice as soon
                                as it appears to the Purchaser that any
                                assessment or claim of a third party received by
                                or coming to the notice of the Purchaser may
                                result in a claim under the Warranties;

                        b)      take such action and give such information and
                                access to personnel, premises, chattels,
                                documents and records to CILT and its
                                professional advisers as CILT may reasonably
                                request;

                        c)      at the request of CILT, allow CILT, at CILT's
                                sole expense, to take the sole conduct of such
                                actions as CILT may deem appropriate in
                                connection with any such assessment or claim in
                                the name of the Purchaser and in that connection
                                the Purchaser shall, upon receiving such
                                security for its costs as the Purchaser may
                                reasonably request, give or cause to be given to
                                CILT such assistance as CILT may reasonably
                                require in avoiding, disputing, resisting,
                                settling, compromises, defending or appealing
                                any such claim and shall instruct such
                                solicitors or other professional advisers as
                                CILT may (with the Purchaser's consent, such
                                consent not to be unreasonably withheld)
                                nominate to act on behalf of the Purchaser, as
                                appropriate, but to act in accordance with
                                CILT's sole instructions; or

                        d)      make no admission of liability, agreement,
                                settlement or compromise with any third party in
                                relation to any such claim or adjudication
                                without the prior written consent of CILT.

                                      -81-


<PAGE>   85


                3.3.3.  In any event, CILT shall be entitled at any stage and at
                        their sole discretion to settle any such third party
                        assessment or claim and shall notify any such decision
                        to settle such assessment or claim to the Purchaser as
                        soon as practicable thereafter.

4.      Acts of the Purchaser:

        No claim shall lie against CILT under the Warranties if such claim is
        wholly or partly attributable to:-

        4.1.    any voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement carried
                out at the written request of or with the written consent of the
                Purchaser before Completion;

        4.2.    any voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement outside
                the ordinary course of business carried out by the Purchaser or
                on its behalf or by persons deriving title from the Purchaser
                under this Agreement on or after Completion;

        4.3.    any admission of liability made without CILT's consent after the
                date hereof by the Purchaser or on its behalf or by persons
                deriving title from the Purchaser under this Agreement on or
                after Completion;

        4.4.    directly or indirectly the cessation of any business carried on
                by the Company or the Purchaser or any holding company or
                subsidiary of the Purchaser or any subsidiary of the holding
                company or the Purchaser (the Purchaser's Group) following
                Completion.

5.      Allowance, provision or reserve in the Accounts and/or the Management
        Accounts:

        No matter shall be the subject of a claim for breach of any of the
        Warranties to the extent that allowance, provision or reserve in respect
        of such matter shall have been made in the Accounts and/or the
        Management Accounts or has been included in calculating creditors or
        deducted in calculating debtors in the Accounts and/or the Management
        Accounts or shall have been otherwise taken account of in calculating
        any sum or sums shown in the Accounts and/or the Management Accounts.

6.      Recovery from third parties:

        Subject to paragraph 15 of this Schedule,

        6.1.    In the event that the Purchaser shall recover any amount from
                some other person any sum in respect of any matter giving rise
                to a claim under the Warranties, the amount of the claim against
                CILT shall be reduced by the amount recovered, less all
                reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Purchaser
                recovering that sum from such other person.

        6.2.    If CILT pays at any time to the Purchaser an amount pursuant to
                a claim in respect of the Warranties and the Purchaser
                subsequently recovers from some other person any sum in respect
                of any matter giving rise to

                                      -82-


<PAGE>   86


                such claim, the Purchaser shall forthwith repay to CILT so much
                of the amount paid to the Purchaser as does not exceed the sum
                recovered from such other person less all reasonable costs,
                charges and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in recovering
                that sum from such other person.

7.      Retrospective legislation:

        No liability shall arise in respect of any breach of any of the
        Warranties to the extent that liability for such breach occurs or is
        increased wholly or partly as a result of any legislation not in force
        at the date hereof which takes effectively retrospectively.

8.      Taxation:

        8.1.    CILT shall have no liability in respect of a Warranty Claim if
                such breach or claim would not have occurred or arisen but for
                any change in the basis of, method of calculation of, or
                increase in the rate or rates of taxation or changes in the
                practice of the Inland Revenue made or coming into effect after
                the date hereof or the withdrawal after the date hereof of any
                extra-statutory concession currently granted by any tax
                authority.

        8.2.    CILT shall have no liability in respect of a Warranty Claim to
                the extent that such claim, or the subject matter thereof occurs
                or arises, or such claim otherwise has arisen, or is increased
                as a result of any change made after the date hereof in any
                accounting or taxation policies or practice of the Company, the
                Purchaser or the Purchaser's Group.

        8.3.    If any specific provision or reserve for Taxation shall at the
                date of any payment required to be made by CILT have proved to
                have been an over-provision or over-reserve the amount of such
                over-provision or over-reserve shall be set off against any
                actual liability of CILT in respect of any claim(s) for breach
                of the Warranties.

9.      No liability for contingent or non-quantifiable claims:

        If any breach of the Warranties arises by reason of some liability
        which, at the time such breach or claim is notified to CILT, is
        contingent only or otherwise not capable of being quantified, then CILT
        shall not be under any obligation to make any payment in respect of such
        breach or claim unless and until such liability ceases to be contingent
        or becomes capable of being quantified, as the case may be. So long as
        such claim shall have been notified to CILT in accordance with paragraph
        2 above, as appropriate, then the proviso to the relevant paragraph
        shall be amended in relation to such claim so as to require that legal
        proceedings be commenced within six months from the date on which the
        said liability ceases to be contingent or becomes capable of being
        quantified, as the case may be, in order for the liability of CILT not
        to determine.

10.     Information of the Purchaser:

        The Purchaser acknowledges and declares that in entering into this
        agreement it has not relied and is not relying on any warranties,
        representations, covenants, undertakings, indemnities, promises,
        forecast or other statements whatsoever

                                      -83-


<PAGE>   87


        whether written or oral (and whether implied or otherwise) (collectively
        "Representations"), other than those expressly set out in this Agreement
        and in the Tax Deed, and the Purchaser hereby irrevocably and
        unconditionally waives any right it may have to claim damage for, or to
        rescind this agreement by reason of, any Representation not expressly
        set out or referred to in this Agreement or the Tax Deed unless such
        representation was made fraudulently.

11.     Payment of claim to be reduction in purchase price:

        Any payment made by CILT in respect of any claim under the Warranties or
        the Tax Deed shall be deemed to be a reduction in that total
        consideration payable under this Agreement.

12.     Insurance:

        No claim shall lie against CILT under the Warranties to the extent such
        claim is recoverable by the Purchaser or the Company or any member of
        the Purchaser's Group under the terms of any insurance policy of the
        Purchaser or the Company or any member of the Purchaser's Group (or
        would have been so recoverable but for any change in the terms of any
        such policy after Completion).

13.     Rescission:

        Save in the event of fraud, no right of rescission shall be available
        after Completion to the Purchaser by reason of any breach of the
        Warranties or any other provision of this Agreement or the Tax Deed.

14.     Trustee's Liability:

        Without prejudice to the foregoing the liability of the Trustee for all
        and any claims under this Agreement and/or the Tax Deed shall not exceed
        the value for the time being of the Trust Assets less an amount equal to
        the Trustee's bona fide estimate of any Permitted Tax Liability or
        Permitted Trust Liability properly payable out of the Trust Assets.

15.     No prejudice to Business:

        Nothing in paragraphs 3 or 6 of this Schedule shall require the
        Purchaser to do or omit to do any act or thing which would or may, in
        the Purchaser's judgment, prejudice the business or interests of the
        Company or any member of the Purchasers' Group and which would not be
        required of the Purchaser to discharge its common law duty to mitigate
        loss.
