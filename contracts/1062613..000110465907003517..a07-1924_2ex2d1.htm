than the last Friday of December 2007) (the " _Closing Date_ ") at the
offices of counsel to Verizon or such other location as may be reasonably
specified in writing by Verizon.

        

## 2.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date, a certificate of merger shall be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with respect to the
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form as is required by,
and executed in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time of filing of the Certificate of
Merger or at such later time as the parties hereto may agree and as is
provided in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger
shall become so effective is herein referred to as the "Effective Time."

  

## 2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effects of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger
and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.  Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Spinco shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of
the Company and Spinco shall become the debts, liabilities, duties and
obligations of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

  

### (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
duly amended in accordance with such certificate of incorporation and
applicable Law.

  

### (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter duly amended in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, such bylaws and applicable
Law.

  

## 2.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject
to Section 7.19, the directors of the Company at the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation.  Such directors and officers shall serve until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

        

## 2.7 _Potential Restructuring of Transactions_. If, prior to the date on
which the Company intends to commence solicitation of proxies for use at
the Company Stockholders Meeting, the IRS notifies Verizon that the IRS will
not issue the IRS Ruling in whole or in part, then, during the ensuing 30
day period, the parties will collaborate reasonably and in good faith in
order to determine a possible alternative structure for the transactions
contemplated hereby that the parties determine, with the assistance of their
respective tax advisors, will either make likely the receipt from the IRS of
the IRS Ruling or eliminate the necessity for an IRS Ruling, in either case,
without ( _a_ ) substantially increasing the costs to any party associated
with the transactions contemplated hereby, ( _b_ ) causing the performance of
the covenants and agreements of any party hereunder to become substantially
more burdensome, ( _c_ ) substantially increasing the regulatory or other
consents or approvals required to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, or ( _d_ ) otherwise resulting in any substantial impediment to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event the
parties reasonably, and in good faith, agree upon such an alternative
structure, they shall be obligated, as soon as practicable thereafter, to
modify the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements accordingly to reflect the change in transaction
structure referenced in the immediately preceding sentence. In furtherance
of the foregoing, each of the parties shall take all action reasonably
necessary to modify the Ruling Request to reflect the transactions as so
modified and effectuate the change in transaction structure contemplated by
this Section 2.7, and each such party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the transactions contemplated hereby, as so modified, to
be consummated as soon as practicable thereafter.  To the extent that the
filing or effectiveness of the materials necessary for the solicitation of
proxies for use at the Company Stockholders Meeting is delayed in order to
afford the parties the time necessary to obtain a response with respect to
the IRS Ruling such delay will be deemed to not constitute, nor constitute
any basis for a claim of, a breach of the Companys covenants under Article
VII hereof or otherwise. The parties acknowledge that Verizon may elect
pursuant to Section 2.4(e) of the Distribution Agreement to change the
structure of certain transactions contemplated in the recitals hereto and to
make amendments to this Agreement in order to reflect such changes.

# _Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates_

  

## 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Spinco, the Company or any
holder of any Spinco Common Stock or Company Common Stock:

        

#### (a) All of the shares of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled in
accordance with Section 3.1(b)) shall be automatically converted into an
aggregate number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock equal to the product of (
_x_ ) 1.5266 multiplied by ( _y_ ) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding, on a Fully Diluted Basis, immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ "), with
each such share of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time to be converted into a number of shares of Company Common
Stock equal to ( _i_ ) the Aggregate Merger Consideration divided by ( _ii_ )
the aggregate number of shares of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ ").

  

#### (b) Each share of Spinco Common Stock held by Spinco as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist and no stock or other consideration shall be issued or delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

#### (c) Each share of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, when converted in accordance with this Section
3.1, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist.

  

#### (d) Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to and at the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
following the Effective Time.

  

## 3.2 _Distribution of Per Share Merger Consideration_.

  

### (a) _Agent_. Prior to or at the Effective Time, the Company shall deposit
with the Agent (as defined in the Distribution Agreement), for the benefit of
persons entitled to receive shares of Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution
and for distribution in accordance with this Article III, through the Agent,
certificates or book-entry authorizations representing the shares of Company
Common Stock (such shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Distribution Fund_ ") issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 upon
conversion of outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock. The Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Company Common Stock
contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 3.1 from the

        

### shares of Company Common Stock held in the Distribution Fund. If the
Company deposits such shares into the Distribution Fund prior to
the Effective Time and the Merger is not consummated, the Agent shall
promptly return such shares to the Company. The Distribution Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose.

  

### (b) _Distribution Procedures_. At the Effective Time, all shares of
Spinco Common Stock shall be converted into shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, immediately
following which the Agent shall distribute on the same basis as the shares of
Spinco Common Stock would have been distributed in the Distribution and to
the persons entitled to receive such Distribution, in respect of the
outstanding shares of Verizon Common Stock held by holders of record of
Verizon Common Stock on the Record Date, all of the shares of Company Common
Stock into which the shares of Spinco Common Stock that otherwise would have
been distributed in the Distribution have been converted pursuant to the
Merger. Each person entitled to receive Spinco Common Stock in the
Distribution shall be entitled to receive in respect of the shares of Spinco
Common Stock otherwise distributable to such person a certificate or book-
entry authorization representing the number of whole shares of Company Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III
(and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock, as
contemplated by Section 3.3) (and any dividends or distributions pursuant to
Section 3.2(c)). The Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any
rights of ownership with respect to the Company Common Stock held by it from
time to time hereunder. The Company agrees that, from and after the
Effective Time, those holders of record of Verizon Common Stock who have
become holders of record of Company Common Stock by virtue of
the Distribution and the Merger shall be holders of record of Company Common
Stock for all purposes for so long as they hold such Company Common Stock.

  

### (c) _Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Company Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock that
have not been distributed by the Agent promptly after the Effective Time,
whether due to a legal impediment to such distribution or otherwise. Subject
to the effect of applicable Laws, following the distribution of any such
previously undistributed shares of Company Common Stock, there shall be paid
to the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, without interest
( _i_ ) at the time of the distribution, the amount of cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares of Company Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.3 and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Company Common Stock and ( _ii_ ) at the
appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the
distribution of such shares and a

        

### payment date subsequent to the distribution of such shares payable with
respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock.

  

### (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Spinco Common Stock_. All shares
of Company Common Stock issued in respect of shares of Spinco Common
Stock (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.2(c)) shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Spinco Common Stock.

  

### (e) _Termination of Distribution Fund_. Any portion of the Distribution
Fund made available to the Agent that remains undistributed to the former
stockholders of Spinco on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Company, upon demand, and any former stockholders
of Spinco who have not received shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment
of their claim for shares of Company Common Stock and any dividends,
distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares with respect to such
Company Common Stock (subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law).

  

### (f) _No Liability_. Neither Spinco, the Surviving Corporation nor the
Agent shall be liable to any holder of any shares of Spinco Common Stock
or any holder of shares of Verizon Common Stock for any shares of Company
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto or with
respect to shares of Spinco Common Stock) or cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

  

### (g) _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of Spinco shall be closed and no transfer shall be made
of any shares of capital stock of Spinco that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

### (h) _Withholding Rights_. Spinco, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
any Spinco Common Stock such amounts as they determine in good faith are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient.

        

## 3.3 _Fractional Shares_.

  

### (a) No fractional shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger and no dividend or distribution with respect to Company Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights
of a stockholder of the Company.

  

### (b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Agent
shall determine the excess of ( _x_ ) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock delivered to the Agent by the Company pursuant to Section 3.2(a) over (
_y_ ) the aggregate number of whole shares of Company Common Stock to be
distributed in respect of shares of Spinco Common Stock pursuant to Section
3.2(b) (such excess, the " _Excess Shares_ "). As soon after the Effective
Time as practicable, the Agent, as agent for the applicable holders, shall
sell the Excess Shares at the then prevailing prices on the New York Stock
Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section 3.3.

  

### (c) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Agent shall be executed on the
NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. The Agent shall use all reasonable
efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the
Effective Time as is practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution
of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net
proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed in respect of such
shares of Spinco Common Stock, the Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for
the applicable holders. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs of the Agent
incurred in connection with such sale or sales of Excess Shares. In addition,
the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Agents compensation and expenses in
connection with such sale or sales. The Agent shall determine the portion of
such net proceeds to which each applicable holder shall be entitled, if any,
by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such holder of Spinco Common Stock is entitled (after taking into account all
shares of Spinco Common Stock then held by such holder) and the denominator
of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all
holders of Spinco Common Stock are entitled.

  

### (d) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid in respect of Spinco Common Stock with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Agent shall pay such amounts to the
applicable holders.

pending, nor to Verizons or Spincos Knowledge, threatened against Verizon

## 5.21 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except as specifically provided in this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements or as disclosed in

the Exchange Act for the year ended December 31, 2005, including the
Companys audited consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005 and 2004,

### _Company SEC Documents_ ") will comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and none of such Company SEC Documents when filed contained, or will contain,
an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, or will omit, to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.  The audited consolidated financial statements and
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in the Company
SEC Documents and the Additional Company SEC Documents (including any related
notes and schedules) and the Company Financial Statements fairly present in
all material respects, or will fairly present in all material respects, the

public offering in February 2005, the Company has timely filed all
reports, registration statements and other filings required to be filed with
the SEC under the rules and regulations of the SEC.  Except as set forth in
the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth in

the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, since

the Company Subsidiaries or in the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity
with GAAP, other than liabilities or obligations that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

  

### (c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a
system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. The Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Company required pursuant to Sections
302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-
Oxley Act_ ").

development or state of circumstances or facts that has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. From September 30, 2006 to the date hereof,
none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has taken any action
or failed to take any action, which action or failure, as the case may be,
would constitute a breach of Section 7.1 if taken without the consent of
Verizon and Spinco after the date hereof.

  

## 6.6 _Investigations; Litigation_. Except as described in the Company
SEC Documents or in Section 6.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter:

respective properties or assets, except where such non-compliance, default or

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this Section 6.7 in respect of
environmental, Tax, employee benefits, labor or communications Laws matters,

as violative of any Regulatory Law or otherwise, each of the Company, Verizon
and Spinco shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such

the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening
competition, whether in the communications industry or otherwise through

notice; and (ii) Verizon shall, at the Companys cost and expense (which
shall be a reimbursement of Verizons fully allocated cost), cause such
notice to be delivered to such customers at least 30 days before the Closing
Date as reasonably anticipated by any party by a direct mailing or in
accordance with such method of notice and notification period that the FCC or
State Regulators may order or require. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company and not Verizon, will be primarily responsible for making all
required filings with the FCC and the State Regulators relating to transfers
of customers and compliance with carrier change authorization, notification
and verification rules.  Verizon and/or Spinco will be responsible for
preparing, distributing, and filing (at Spincos expense) any notices
relating to "discontinuance, reduction, or impairment" of service to the
customers of Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries after giving effect to the
Contribution required by 47 C.F.R. Sections 63.19 and 63.71.

  

### (g) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, at its own expense,
shall adopt (to the extent permitted by State Regulators) the tariffs, price
lists, schedules of rates, or other statements of terms and conditions,
including, without limitation, special customer arrangements, special
assemblies, price flex arrangements, and individual customer based
arrangements of Verizon New England and Verizon Select Services Inc. for
telecommunications services, which are applicable in whole or in part in
Maine, New Hampshire, or Vermont, are effective under applicable laws and
regulations, and are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Tariffs_ "). The Company shall maintain the Tariffs
in effect at least until the end of the service term specified in (i) the
Tariffs (to the extent permitted by State Regulators), ( _ii_ )
agreements implementing such Tariffs with customers served by Verizon
Affiliates under retained Blended Customer Contracts identified in Section
1.1(a) of the Disclosure Letter to the Distribution Agreement and the
agreements of customers who do not provide Verizon Third Party Consents under
this Agreement (each a " _Specified Contract_ ") and ( _iii_ ) agreements
implementing such Tariffs with Persons who are Affiliates of Verizon New
England on or before the Closing Date, and any optional renewal term
exercisable by customers which are party to a Specified Contract or such
Affiliates in such agreements or Tariffs. The Company further agrees that,
to the extent such Tariffs or agreements implementing such Tariffs contain
rates and charges or other terms and conditions based on volume of service,
amount of purchase or spend, or similar volume commitments by the customers
which are party to a Specified Contract or such Affiliates (the " _Volume
Commitments_ "), the Company will reduce such Volume Commitments pro-rata,
without a change in rates and charges or other terms and conditions under
such Tariffs or agreements, to reflect the fact that the customers which are
party to a Specified Contract or such Affiliates may, after Closing, take
service from Verizon New England and the Company and not from Verizon New
England or the Company alone.  The pro-rata

        

### reduction shall be equal to or exceed the amount of the Volume Commitment
provided by Verizon New England after Closing. By way of example, and not by
limitation, if after Closing, such Affiliate purchased 75% of a Volume
Commitment from Company and 25% of a Volume Commitment from Verizon New
England, then Company would reduce the Volume Commitment by 25% in affected
Tariffs and agreements implementing such Tariffs. At its own expense, the
Company shall make all filings and take all other actions as may be required
by applicable laws and regulations to make the Tariffs and pro-
rata reductions of Volume Commitments adopted or made by the Company under
this Section 7.6(g) legally effective not later than the Effective Time.
If the applicable State Regulators do not permit, in whole or in part,
the adoption of such Tariffs by the Company or the maintenance of such
Tariffs during the service terms described above in this Section 7.6(g), then
from and after the Effective Time and through the date on which the Company
would no longer have been required under this Section 7.6(g) to maintain the
applicable Tariffs had such State Regulators permitted their adoption, the
Company will provide service terms, rates and services equivalent to the
Tariffs, including reductions in Volume Commitments, by means and methods
acceptable to the applicable State Regulators.

  

### (h) Effective no later than the Effective Time, Verizon shall cause
Verizon New England to relinquish voluntarily any certificate of public good
or any other equivalent franchise or authorization under Law, including prior
Law, to provide ILEC regulated intrastate services, which it possesses in
Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont and to have obtained the approvals of the
applicable public utility commissions in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont
for the revocation, termination or transfer to ILEC Spinco Subsidiary of such
authorizations and franchises and for its abandonment and discontinuance of
all ILEC regulated intrastate services subject to the jurisdiction of such
commissions. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than 30
days thereafter, Verizon New England shall file to withdraw its intrastate
tariffs or schedules of rates, terms and conditions for ILEC regulated
intrastate services.

        

### 7.7 _Employee Matters_. Throughout the internal restructurings and merger
taken in contemplation of this Agreement, including the Internal Spinoffs and
Internal Restructurings, the Contribution, Distribution, and the Merger, the
Spinco Employees shall maintain uninterrupted continuity of employment,
compensation and benefits, and, also for union-represented employees,
uninterrupted continuity of representation for purposes of collective
bargaining and uninterrupted continuity of coverage under their collective
bargaining agreements, in each case as contemplated by and described in the
Employee Matters Agreement.

  

## 7.8 _Certain Third Party Consents_.

  

### (a) Verizon and Spinco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
identify and obtain prior to the Closing any material Verizon Third Party
Consents necessary to be obtained to authorize, approve or permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement
or this Agreement. If such Verizon Third Party Consents have not been
obtained prior to the Closing, Verizon and the Surviving Corporation
shall use commercially reasonable efforts thereafter to obtain such Verizon
Third Party Consents for a period of six months following the Closing;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Verizon and the Company (or, for periods
following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) shall not be required to
pay more than $1,000,000 in the aggregate to obtain all Verizon Third Party
Consents sought pursuant to this Section 7.8(a) (inclusive of any amounts
paid in respect of Verizon IP Consents as provided in Section 7.8(b) and any
costs associated with the separation of any Blended Customer Contract as
provided in Section 7.8(e)) with any such payment borne 60% by Verizon and
40% by the Company (on a dollar for dollar basis), _provided_ that such
limitation shall not apply to any filing, recordation or similar fees payable
to any Governmental Authority, which filing, recordation or similar fees
shall be paid by the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (b) Promptly following the date hereof and, if the Closing occurs, for a
period of six months following the Closing Date, Verizon shall use, and shall
cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts, in cooperation
with the Surviving Corporation, to identify and thereafter obtain Verizon IP
Consents. The parties shall bear the costs of obtaining any Verizon IP
Consent (collectively, the " _Verizon IP Consent Costs_ ") as provided in
Section 7.8(b) of the Verizon Disclosure Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, (
_i_ ) Verizon IP Consents shall include any authorization, approval, consent,
waiver or replacement license of a third Person required to permit the
Company and the Subsidiaries, as applicable, to retain rights to any material
Network Element Software that is made available to one or more Contributing
Companies pursuant to an Excluded Contract and ( _ii_ ) except to the extent
provided otherwise in Section 7.8(b) of the Verizon Disclosure Letter,
Verizon IP Consent Costs shall not include the costs attributable to
obtaining

        

### for the benefit of Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries any upgrade
or maintenance, support or other service used or useful in the operation of
material Network Element Software following the Closing.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but
subject to the obligations set forth in this Section 7.8(c), to the extent
any Verizon Third Party Consent or Verizon IP Consent is required in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Distribution Agreement or this Agreement and such Verizon Third Party Consent
or Verizon IP Consent is not received prior to the Closing, then, ( _i_ ) if
applicable, the Contract that is the subject of such Verizon Third Party
Consent shall not be assigned in the Contribution or ( _ii_ ) if applicable,
to the extent any such Contract requiring a Verizon Third Party Consent may
only be enjoyed by an Affiliate of Verizon, such Contract shall be
transferred to another Affiliate of Verizon, and Verizon agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to make the benefits of any such Contract
available to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for a period of
one year following the Closing Date, subject to ( _x_ ) the assumption of all
obligations in respect of such Contract by the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries, ( _y_ ) the limitations on required payments set forth in
Sections 7.8(a) and 7.8(b) and ( _z_ ) Section 7.8(f).

  

### (d) Verizon shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
the Company within 60 days of the date hereof ( _i_ ) a list of all third
parties who are counterparties to an Excluded Contract and which Verizon
reasonably believes were paid an aggregate of $100,000 or more in calendar
year 2006 by Verizon or its Subsidiaries as indicated in the accounts payable
system of Verizon in respect of such Contract and ( _ii_ ) to the extent not
prohibited pursuant to confidentiality obligations contained in any such
Contract, either ( _a_ ) a copy of such Contract (if such Contract is in
writing) or ( _b_ ) a description of the products/services which are the
subject of the Contract.

  

### (e) With respect to Blended Customer Contracts, Verizon and the Company
will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the Closing or,
if not obtained, will use commercially reasonable efforts for 180 days
following the Closing to obtain from the counterparty to each Blended
Customer Contract any needed consent to separate the portion of such Contract
that relates to the goods or services purchased from or supplied to the
Spinco Business under such Blended Customer Contract, it being agreed that
Verizon shall not be required to grant any consideration to any counterparty
to such a Blended Customer Contract except to the extent of any consent costs
that are included in the amounts for which Verizon is responsible pursuant to
Section 7.8(a). The Contract constituting the separated portion of any
Blended Customer Contract that relates to the Spinco Business as described in
the preceding sentence shall be assumed by and become

        

### the responsibility of Spinco (or the Surviving Corporation to the extent
it is separated following the Closing).

  

### (f) In the event any customer Contract that would have been assigned in
the Contribution as a Spinco Asset but for the failure to obtain a Verizon
Third Party Consent is not assigned or any Blended Customer Contract that
would have been assumed in part by Spinco pursuant to Section 7.8(e) but for
the failure of the counterparty to consent to such assumption is not assumed,
then ( _i_ ) to the extent such Contract involves the provision to the
customer thereunder of ILEC services that are a part of the Spinco Business,
Verizon shall use the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries succeeding
to the Spinco Business to provide such services to such customer subject to
the rights, if any, of such customer under such Contract to consent thereto
and ( _ii_ ) to the extent such Contract involves the provision to the
customer thereunder of non-ILEC services, Verizon shall continue to provide
such services to such customer in accordance with such Contract.
With respect to ILEC services delivered by the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries in respect of such Contracts, Verizon shall either ( _A_
) remit to the Surviving Corporation amounts received from the
applicable customers in accordance with the applicable Tariff (which the
Surviving Corporation shall have mirrored in accordance with Section 7.6(g))
or, if applicable, in accordance with the last sentence of Section 7.6(g), in
each case including as to payment terms or ( _B_ ) make payment to the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Transferred Affiliate Arrangement, including as to payment terms. With
respect to non-ILEC services and ILEC services delivered by Verizon or its
Subsidiaries under such Contracts without the assistance of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, Verizon shall remit to the Surviving
Corporation its net amounts received (after payment of third party costs and
any applicable taxes) in respect of the delivery of such services to such
customers, which payment shall be made by Verizon promptly after its receipt
of such revenues and in any event no later than 45 days thereafter. The
provisions of this Section 7.8(f) shall exclusively govern the circumstances
described in the first sentence hereof, notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement or the Distribution Agreement.

  

### (g) Verizon will use its commercially reasonable efforts to identify to
the Company prior to the Closing any Verizon Guarantees (as defined in the
Distribution Agreement) and any Spinco Guarantees (as defined in the
Distribution Agreement).

        

### 7.9 _Tax Matters_.

  

## (a) _IRS Rulings_.

  

##### (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Verizon and the Company, as to matters germane to the Merger, shall submit to
the IRS a request (the " _Ruling Request_ ") for ( _A_ ) the IRS Ruling, and
( _B_ ) any other ruling in connection with the Contribution, the
Distribution or the Merger that Verizon, in consultation with the Company,
deems to be appropriate. The initial Ruling Request and any supplemental
materials submitted to the IRS relating thereto (each, an " _IRS Submission_
") shall be prepared by Verizon.  Verizon shall provide the Company with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each IRS Submission prior to
the filing of such IRS Submission with the IRS as provided in Section 10.01
of the Tax Sharing Agreement; _provided_ that Verizon may redact from any IRS
Submission any information (" _Redactable Information_ ") that ( _A_ )
Verizon, in its good faith judgment, considers to be confidential and not
germane to the Companys or Spincos obligations under this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Agreements, and ( _B_ ) is not a part of any other
publicly available information, including any non-confidential filing.

  

##### (ii) Verizon shall provide the Company with copies of each IRS
Submission as filed with the IRS promptly following the filing thereof;
_provided_ that Verizon may redact any Redactable Information from the IRS
Submission. Each of Verizon, Spinco and the Company agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the IRS Ruling and the other
rulings set forth in the Ruling Request, including providing such appropriate
information and representations as the IRS shall require in connection with
the Ruling Request and any IRS Submissions. Solely for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Section 7.9(a)(ii) shall provide grounds for Verizon, Spinco
or the Company to alter any obligation or limitation imposed upon it under
this Agreement.

  

### (b) _Distribution Tax Opinion_. Each of Verizon, Spinco and the Company
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Distribution
Tax Opinion. The Distribution Tax Opinion shall be based upon the IRS Ruling,
any other rulings issued by the IRS in connection with the Ruling Request,
and customary representations and covenants, including those contained in
certificates of Verizon, Spinco, the Company and others, reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to Verizon Tax Counsel (such
representations and covenants, the " _Distribution Tax Representations_ ").
Each of Verizon, Spinco and the Company shall deliver to Verizon Tax Counsel,
for purposes of the Distribution Tax Opinion, the Distribution Tax
Representations.

        

### (c) _Merger Tax Opinions_. Verizon and Spinco, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall cooperate with each other in obtaining, and
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, a
written opinion of their respective tax counsel, Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and
Walker LLP, in the case of the Company (" _Company Tax Counsel_ "), and
Verizon Tax Counsel, in the case of Verizon and Spinco, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Verizon, respectively (each such
opinion, a " _Merger Tax Opinion_ "), dated as of the Effective Time, to the
effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth
in such opinion, the Merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of the Company, Verizon
and Spinco shall deliver to Company Tax Counsel and Verizon Tax Counsel for
purposes of the Merger Tax Opinions customary representations and covenants,
including those contained in certificates of the Company, Verizon, Spinco and
others, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Company Tax Counsel
and Verizon Tax Counsel.

  

### (d) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Verizon, Spinco and the Company
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Tax-Free Status of the
Transactions.

  

## 7.10 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, each of Verizon,
Spinco and the Company shall, subject to applicable Law, afford to each other
and to each others respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other authorized representatives, reasonable access during normal business
hours, from the date hereof through to the date which is the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1, to its and its Subsidiaries officers, employees, accountants,
consultants, representatives, plants, properties, Contracts (other than
Excluded Contracts), commitments, books, records (including Tax Returns) and
any report, schedule or other document filed or received by it pursuant to
the requirements of the federal or state securities laws, and shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its respective representatives to
furnish promptly to the others such additional financial and operating data
and other information in its possession, as to its and its Subsidiaries
respective businesses and properties as the others or their respective duly
authorized representatives, as the case may be, may reasonably request, it
being understood that in no event will any party be required to provide
access to its accountants work papers and, in the case of Spinco and
Verizon, the foregoing obligations will be limited to information regarding
the Spinco Business.  The parties hereby agree that the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information and material
furnished by any party or its representatives thereunder and hereunder.

        

## 7.11 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

  

### (a) Except as set forth in Sections 7.11(b) through (d) hereof, the
Company agrees that, following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is
terminated pusuant to Section 9.1, neither it nor any Company Subsidiary
shall, and that it shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and each of
the Company Subsidiarys officers, directors, employees, advisors and agents
not to, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) knowingly solicit, initiate or
encourage any inquiry or proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, ( _ii_ ) provide any non-
public information or data to any Person relating to or in connection with a
Company Acquisition Proposal, engage in any discussions or
negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement a Company
Acquisition Proposal, ( _iii_ ) approve, recommend, agree to or accept, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend, agree to or accept, any Company
Acquisition Proposal, or ( _iv_ ) approve, recommend, agree to or accept, or
propose to approve, recommend, agree to or accept, or execute or enter into,
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Company
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries
officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries) shall be a breach of this Section 7.11(a) by
the Company. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal
(except with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

  

### (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Companys Board of Directors from, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by
the holders of Company Common Stock, engaging in any discussions or
negotiations with, or providing any non-public information to, any Person, if
and only to the extent that ( _i_ ) the Company receives from such Person an
unsolicited bona fide Company Superior Proposal or a Company Acquisition
Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal, ( _ii_ ) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its legal advisors) that its failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, ( _iii_ ) prior to providing any
information or data to any Person in connection with a proposal by any such
Person, ( _A_ ) the Companys Board of Directors receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement no less restrictive than
the Confidentiality

        

### Agreement and ( _B_ ) such information has been provided to Verizon (or
is provided to Verizon at the same time it is provided to such Person, to the
extent not previously provided or made available to Verizon) and ( _iv_ )
prior to providing any non-public information or data to any Person or
entering into discussions or negotiations with any Person, the Companys
Board of Directors notifies Verizon promptly of any such inquiry, proposal or
offer received by, any such information requested from, or any such
discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their officers, directors,
employees, advisors and agents indicating, in connection with such notice,
the material terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition Proposal and the
identity of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company
agrees that it shall keep Verizon reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt
basis, of the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers, any
changes thereto, and the status of any such discussions or negotiations and
will notify Verizon promptly of any determination by the Companys Board of
Directors that a Company Superior Proposal has been made.  For purposes of
this Agreement, a " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer
made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, by merger,
consolidation or otherwise, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities, at least a majority of the shares of the Company Common Stock
then outstanding or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors
of the Company (after consultation with its legal and financial advisors)
determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to the Companys
stockholders than the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and
conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement as well as any
other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of the Company)
and reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms so proposed, taking
into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
proposal.

  

### (c) Prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company
Common Stock, the Board of Directors of the Company may, if it concludes in
good faith (after consultation with its legal advisors) that failure to do so
would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
withdraw or modify its recommendation of the Merger, but only at a time that
is after the third Business Day following Verizons receipt of written notice
from the Company advising Verizon of its intention to do so. Notwithstanding
any withdrawal or modification of recommendation pursuant to this Section
7.11(c), Verizon shall have the option, exercisable within five Business Days
after such withdrawal or modification, to cause the Board of Directors to
submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of
adopting this Agreement.

  

### (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a)

        

### promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
the Company stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with its legal advisors), it is
required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, a
Company Acquisition Proposal unless the Company has first terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(h) hereof and has otherwise complied with
the provisions thereof.

  

## 7.12 _Director and Officer Matters_.

  

### (a) From and after the date hereof, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries shall provide such cooperation
and assistance as Verizon may reasonably request to enable, if Verizon so
chooses, Verizon or a Subsidiary thereof to maintain following the Closing,
at Verizons expense, directors and officers liability insurance policies
and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering each person who is, or
has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of
Verizon or a Contributing Company and each person who served at the request
of a Contributing Company as a director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise, including any person serving in such
capacity with respect to Spinco or a Spinco Subsidiary (the " _Identified
Persons_ ").

  

### (b) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, on
behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and their respective successors and
assigns, and for all parties claiming by, through or under them (the "
_Surviving Corporation Releasors_ "), hereby irrevocably release, remise and
forever discharge each of the Identified Persons, and each of their
respective estates and heirs, of and from any and all claims, whether
presently known or unknown, which any Surviving Corporation Releasor has or
may have of any kind arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or
alleged acts or omissions, by the Identified Persons in the capacities
specified in Section 7.12(a) prior to the Closing.

  

### (c) In the event of any claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or
investigation (" _Action_ ") arising out of or pertaining to acts or
omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by the Identified Persons in the
capacities specified in Section 7.12(a) prior to the Closing, from and after
the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall
provide reasonable cooperation, at Verizons expense, in defense of any such
Action.

        

### 7.13 _Rule 145 Affiliates_. Spinco shall, at least 10 days prior to
the Effective Time, cause to be delivered to the Company a list, reviewed by
its counsel, identifying any persons who will be, in its reasonable judgment,
at the Effective Time, "affiliates" of Spinco for purposes of Rule 145
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act (each, a " _Rule 145
Affiliate_ "). Spinco shall furnish such information and documents as the
Company may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing such list. Spinco
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each person who is
identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in the list furnished pursuant to this
Section 7.13 to execute a written agreement (each, a " _Rule 145 Affiliate
Agreement_ "), substantially in the form of Exhibit A to this Agreement, at
or prior to the Effective Time.

  

## 7.14 _Public Announcements_. Verizon and the Company shall consult
with each other and shall mutually agree upon any press release or
public announcement relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and neither of them shall issue any such press release or make any
such public announcement prior to such consultation and agreement, except as
may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer
quotation system, in which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement.

  

## 7.15 _Notification_.

  

### (a) Verizon shall give notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
notice to Verizon, of any occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event
that would reasonably be expected to cause the failure of Verizon or its
Affiliates or the Company or its Affiliates, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy, in any material respect, any closing condition pursuant to
Article VIII.

  

### (b) Each of the parties hereto shall keep the others informed on a timely
basis as to ( _i_ ) the status of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements and the obtaining of all necessary and appropriate
exemptions, rulings, consents, authorizations and waivers related thereto and
( _ii_ ) the status of any other material regulatory proceeding, pending as

Spinco Business or the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, including making available to the other parties copies of all
material communications with State Regulators in connection with any such
proceeding.

        

### 7.16 _Real Property Matters_. Promptly after the execution of
this Agreement:

  

##### (i) the parties will negotiate in good faith a mutually acceptable
arrangement allowing Verizon and its Affiliates to occupy and use following
the Closing the property located at 875 Holt Avenue, Manchester, New
Hampshire in substantially the same manner insofar as practicable as such
property is occupied and used by them (other than in connection with the
Spinco Business) during the 12 month period prior the Closing Date;

  

##### (ii) the parties will negotiate in good faith a mutually acceptable
lease arrangement allowing Verizon and/or its Affiliates to continue to
occupy and use a portion of the property located at 770 Elm Street,

arrangement (the " _NH Lease_ ") whereby Verizon and/or its Affiliate(s)
shall ( _A_ ) occupy the entire first floor of the NH Premises (to the extent

reasonably agree, and in connection therewith shall consider in good
faith the form of lease agreement proposed by Verizon to the Company prior to
the date hereof; and

  

##### (iii) the parties will negotiate in good faith a mutually acceptable
lease arrangement allowing Verizon and/or its Affiliates to continue to
occupy and use a portion of the property located at 59 Park Street, Bangor,
Maine (the " _ME Premises_ ") pursuant to a gross lease arrangement (the "

proposed by Verizon to the Company prior to the date hereof.

  

## 7.17 _Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Verizon or Spinco, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective

Spinco Securities and related agreements that are not addressed by clause (i)

Exchange; _provided_ that Verizon shall keep the Company reasonably updated
regarding such arrangements.

other requested certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the New Financing, the Spinco Securities or the Debt Exchange

, that (A) no such agreements or documents shall impose any monetary
obligation or liability on Spinco or the Company prior to the Effective Time

any such actions required to permit the assumption by the

related fee agreement) without the consent of the Company and Verizon.
 Spinco and the Company, acting reasonably, shall jointly participate in the
negotiation of the definitive agreements relating to the New
Financing, consistent with the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter.
If for any reason any portion of the New Financing becomes unavailable or is
insufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following such
event, take all actions necessary to obtain, in consultation with Verizon,
and consummate on such terms as may then be available, including from
alternate sources, alternative financing for the same purposes as the
purposes of the New Financing (" _Alternative Financing_ "). Any commitment
fees associated with any Alternative Financing shall be borne by the Company.
Verizon shall cooperate with the Companys efforts to seek to obtain the
Alternative Financing but shall not be obligated to incur any obligations in
connection with the Alternative Financing (other than the obligation to pay
Spinco Debt

indebtedness of the Company that is contemplated by any commitment letter
associated with the New Financing or any Alternative Financing to be repaid

after the Effective Time material information relating to the Surviving
Corporation is timely made known to the management of the Surviving

Company desires that Verizon cause to be purchased. Promptly thereafter,
and after consultation with the relevant third party vendors where Verizon
deems it appropriate, Verizon shall inform the Company of the anticipated

item of the Supplies shall be the greater of the average price paid by

such item.

  

### (b) The Company shall submit to Verizon a single purchase order for the
actual amount of such Supplies that it desires be purchased at such price or
prices and shall provide Verizon with a letter of credit (which may be
replaced at any time by a new letter of credit) securing the full amount of

Company submits its purchase order for Supplies to Verizon, Verizon
shall submit a purchase order or orders for such Supplies to its applicable
vendor or vendors (unless any such purchase order cannot be submitted in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Contract with such vendor).
Verizon shall provide to the Company a copy of all invoices received from the
applicable vendor or vendors in respect of the purchase of the Supplies
promptly after Verizons receipt of such invoices. Within three Business
Days following delivery by Verizon to the Company of a copy of the invoice
received from the applicable vendor or vendors in respect of the purchase of
the Supplies, the Company shall pay to Verizon the full amount due in respect
of such invoice by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If such
payment is not timely made, the Purchase Letter of Credit shall permit
Verizon to draw against it for the full purchase price of such Supplies.
Upon the Companys payment in full to Verizon of the purchase price in
respect of all invoices for any Supplies ordered by the Company hereunder,
Verizon shall surrender the Purchase Letter of Credit to the Company.

  

### (c) Verizon shall take delivery of the Supplies on behalf of the Company
and shall notify the Company promptly after the delivery of such Supplies.
 The Company shall take delivery of, and remove from the facilities
of Verizon and its Subsidiaries, any Supplies ordered by Verizon or
its Subsidiaries on behalf of the Company promptly after the Effective Time,
or after any earlier delivery of such Supplies at the Companys election.
Verizon shall provide the Company with commercially reasonably access during
regular business hours on reasonable prior notice for purposes of such
removal.  The Company shall promptly pay or reimburse Verizon for any
costs arising out of damage caused by the Companys removal of any
such Supplies. Verizon shall have no liability to the Company in respect of
any casualty to or loss of such Supplies. Verizon shall store such Supplies
under conditions that are substantially similar to those conditions under
which Verizon and its Subsidiaries store similar Supplies ordered in
the ordinary course of their business.

        

### (d) Verizon shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to make any
returns of Supplies that the Company may request, and shall promptly remit to
the Company any refund received from a vendor in respect of such a return.
Solely to the extent that the Company or its applicable Subsidiary is unable
to bring such a claim on its own behalf, Verizon shall assist the Company by
making any good faith warranty claims against a vendor in respect of such
Supplies that the Company may request be brought and shall promptly remit to
the Company the proceeds of any such claim. The Company shall pay or promptly
reimburse any costs and expenses that Verizon and its Subsidiaries may incur
in respect of its obligations under this Section 7.26(d).

  

### (e) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, (i) the
Company shall take delivery of and remove from the facilities of Verizon and
its Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 7.26(c) any Supplies ordered by
Verizon or its Subsidiaries on behalf of the Company promptly after such
termination or, if such Supplies have not been delivered at the time of such
termination, promptly after Verizon gives notice to the Company that such
Supplies have been delivered, and (ii) if any such Supplies have not been so
removed within 10 Business Days of the later of (A) the termination of this
Agreement and (B) if such Supplies have not been delivered to Verizon or its
Subsidiaries at the time of termination, Verizons notice to the Company that
such Supplies have been delivered, then such Supplies shall become the
property of Verizon to be used or disposed of in its sole discretion.

  

## 7.27 _Joint Defense Arrangements_. Prior to the Closing, Verizon and the
Company, each acting reasonably, shall negotiate the terms of a joint defense
agreement that will set forth the procedures for defending and resolving any
threatened or filed litigation that constitutes in part a Spinco Liability
(as defined in the Distribution Agreement) and a Verizon Liability
(as defined in the Distribution Agreement) on a basis that provides for the
active involvement and cooperation of each of Verizon and the Surviving
Corporation, it being understood that lead counsel defending such litigation
shall be selected by Verizon (after reasonable consultation with the Company,
if such counsel was not selected prior to the Effective Time) and that
neither Verizon nor the Surviving Corporation shall have the authority to
bind the other party in any settlement of such litigation without the written
consent of such other party. The parties agree that such agreement shall
incorporate an equitable procedure for limiting the liability of an indemnity
party in the event a settlement offer is accepted by such party and rejected
by the counterparty, taking into account the party which is most likely to
suffer the greater amount of Losses (including for such purposes
payments hereunder), and a more adverse settlement or resolution results.

be governed by terms, provisions and procedures of the Tax Sharing Agreement
and not this Article X.

        

## 10.3 _Definitions for Purposes of this Article_.

  

### (a) " _Indemnification Payment_ " means any amount of Losses required to
be paid pursuant to this Agreement;

  

### (b) " _Indemnitee_ " means any Person entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement, either a Verizon Indemnitee or a Surviving Corporation
Indemnitee as the case may be;

  

### (c) " _Indemnitor_ " means any person or entity required to provide
indemnification under this Agreement; and

  

### (d) " _Losses_ " means any losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies,
costs and expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys and
consultants fees and expenses and including the reasonable costs and
expenses of investigating and defending any indemnification claim), including
all Taxes resulting from indemnification payments hereunder ( _1_ ) reduced
by the amount of insurance proceeds recovered from any Person with respect
thereto (after deducting related costs and expenses); and ( _2_ ) excluding
any such losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses to the extent that
the underlying liability or obligation is the result of any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any Indemnitee.

  

## 10.4 _Limitation on Claims for Indemnifiable Losses_.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein:

  

### (a) No claim may be asserted by any Spinco Indemnitee under this Article
X arising from any failure to transfer any Spinco Asset to Spinco unless
such claim is asserted, if at all, within 18 months from the Closing Date.

  

### (b) No Indemnitor shall be liable to or obligated to indemnify any
Indemnitee hereunder for any consequential, special, multiple, punitive or
exemplary damages including, but not limited to, damages arising from loss or

payable to or have been recovered by a third person and are the subject of a
Third Party Claim for which indemnification is available under the express
terms of this Article X.

        

### (c) Verizon and the Company shall cooperate with each other with respect
to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is
obligated to indemnify the other party (or its Affiliates) hereunder,
including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Losses
and resolve any such claim or liability prior to initiating litigation.

  

## 10.5 _Defense of Claims_.

  

### (a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnitee receives notice of
the assertion of any claim or of the commencement of any action or proceeding
by any entity that is not either a Surviving Corporation Indemnitee or a
Verizon Indemnitee (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnitee, with respect to which an Indemnitor is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee will give such
Indemnitor prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than ten
calendar days after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim,  _provided_
, _however_ , that the failure of an Indemnitee to notify the Indemnitor
within the time period set forth herein shall only relieve the Indemnitor
from its obligation to indemnify to the extent that the Indemnitor is
materially prejudiced by such failure or delay (whether as a result of
the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses or otherwise). Upon receipt
of notification of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall be entitled,
upon written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume the investigation and
defense thereof at such Indemnitors expense with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall not have
the right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim in the event such
Third Party Claim is primarily for injunctive relief or criminal penalty of
the Indemnitee, and in any such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnitee in connection with such Third Party Claim shall be
considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement. Whether or not the
Indemnitor elects to assume the investigation and defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in the investigation and defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnitee shall pay the fees and disbursements of such separate
counsel unless ( _1_ ) the employment of such separate counsel has
been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnitor; ( _2_ )
the Indemnitor has failed to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within 20 calendar days after receipt of notice thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee; or ( _3_ ) the named parties to
the proceeding in which such claim, demand, action or cause of action has
been asserted include both the Indemnitor and such Indemnitee and, in the
reasonable judgment of counsel to such Indemnitee, there exists one or more
good faith defenses that may be available to the Indemnitee that are in
conflict with those available to the Indemnitor or that the Indemnitor and
Indemnitee have actual material conflicting interests with respect to such
claim, demand, action or cause of action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnitor shall not be liable for the fees and disbursements of more than
one counsel for all Indemnitees in connection with any one proceeding or any
similar or related proceedings arising from

        

### the same general allegations or circumstances.  Without the prior
written consent of an Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, the Indemnitor will not enter into any settlement of or consent to
the entry of judgment in connection with any Third Party Claim that ( _i_ )
would lead to liability or create any financial or other obligation on the
part of the Indemnitee, ( _ii_ ) does not contain, as an unconditional term
thereof, the release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such
Third Party Claim or such Third Party Claim is not dismissed against the
Indemnitee with prejudice and without the imposition of any financial or
other obligation on the Indemnitee or ( _iii_ ) admits the liability or fault
of the Indemnitee (the " _Settlement Requirements_ "). If a settlement offer
solely for money damages (and otherwise satisfying the Settlement
Requirements) is made to resolve a Third Party Claim and the Indemnitor
notifies the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnitors willingness to accept
the settlement offer and pay the amount called for by such offer without
reservation of any rights or defenses against the Indemnitee and if the
Indemnitee fails to consent to such settlement offer within ten calendar days
after its receipt of such notice, Indemnitee may continue to contest such
claim, free of any participation by the Indemnitor, and the amount of any
ultimate liability with respect to such Third Party Claim that the Indemnitor
has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of ( _x_ )
the amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnitee declined to accept
plus the Losses of the Indemnitee relating to such Third Party Claim through
the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or ( _y_ ) the aggregate
Losses of the Indemnitee with respect to such claim. The party controlling
any defense shall keep the other party advised of the status of such action,
suit, proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and shall consider in good
faith all reasonable recommendations made by the other party with respect
thereto.

  

### (b) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnitee for Losses that do not
result from a Third Party Claim (each, a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be
asserted by giving the Indemnitor prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than 60 calendar days after the incurrence thereof or such
Indemnitees actual knowledge of such event (whichever is later), _provided_
, _however_ , that the failure of an Indemnitee to notify the Indemnitor
within the time period set forth herein shall only relieve the Indemnitor
from its obligation to indemnify to the extent that the Indemnitor is
materially prejudiced by such failure or delay (whether as a result of the
forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses or otherwise), and the
Indemnitor will have a period of 30 calendar days within which to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnitor does not so respond
within such 30 calendar day period, the Indemnitor will be deemed to have
accepted such claim. If the Indemnitor rejects such claim, the Indemnitee
will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee on
the terms and subject to the provisions of this Article X.

  

## 10.6 _Subrogation_. If after the making of any Indemnification Payment,
the amount of the Losses to which such payment relates is reduced
by recovery, settlement or

        

## otherwise under any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim,
recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person, the amount of
such reduction (less any costs, expenses, premiums or Taxes incurred in
connection therewith) as and when actually received by the Indemnitee will
promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor. Upon making any
Indemnification Payment, the Indemnitor will, to the extent of
such Indemnification Payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee
against any third party that is not an Affiliate of the Indemnitee in respect
of the Losses to which the Indemnification Payment relates; _provided_ that (
_a_ ) the Indemnitor shall then be in compliance with its obligations under
this Agreement in respect of such Losses, and ( _b_ ) until the
Indemnitee recovers full payment of its Losses, all claims of the Indemnitor
against any such third party on account of said Indemnification Payment will
be subrogated and subordinated in right of payment to the Indemnitees rights
against such third party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any
other provision of this Article X, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will
duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence
and perfect the above-described subrogation and subordination rights.

  

## 10.7 _Other Rights and Remedies_. Following the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy at law for Verizon or the Company and all Affiliates thereof
for any claim (whether such claim is framed in tort, contract or otherwise),
arising out of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement in this Agreement other than a claim for fraud or
willful misconduct under this Agreement or the Distribution Agreement, shall
be a claim by Verizon or the Company for indemnification pursuant to this
Article X.

otherwise indicated. The table of contents to this Agreement is for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.  Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and

of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the
defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine
and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement,

        

### instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns.

  

### (b) Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation

this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, "consistent with past practice" when
used with respect to Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries shall mean the past

consent, approval or election given to any party hereto may be exercised by
such party in its sole discretion.

  

## 11.4 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be declared
judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have
the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it
being the intent and agreement of the parties hereto that this
Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent
necessary to render it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its
intent or, if such modification is not possible, by substituting therefor
another provision that is legal and enforceable and that achieves the same
objective.

rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior

assigns) any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, and no Person (other than as
so specified) shall be deemed a third party beneficiary under or by reason of
this Agreement.

or in respect of any certificate delivered with respect hereto or thereto
and, to the fullest extent legally permissible, each of the parties hereto,

and agrees not to seek to assert or enforce any such liability that any such
Person otherwise might have pursuant to applicable Law.

other Transaction Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and
the Disclosure Letters and the other documents delivered pursuant
hereto) constitutes the entire agreement of all the parties hereto and
supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between or among the parties, or any of them, with respect
to the subject matter hereof.

the Merger, which shall be consummated in accordance with the DGCL, this
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York without giving effect to the conflicts of
law principles thereof.

  

## 11.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one agreement binding on the parties
hereto, notwithstanding that not all parties are signatories to the original
or the same counterpart.
