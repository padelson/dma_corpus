RECITALS

1\. Company and Originators are parties to the Purchase and Sale Agreement
dated as of April 30, 2003 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
prior to the date hereof, the " _Purchase and Sale Agreement_ ");

2\. Each of the parties hereto desires to amend the Purchase and Sale
Agreement as hereinafter set forth.

_NOW THEREFORE_ , for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1\. __Certain Defined Terms__. Capitalized terms that are used herein without
definition shall have the meanings set forth in the Purchase and Sale
Agreement or in the Receivables Purchase Agreement (as defined in the Purchase
and Sale Agreement).

2.  _ _Amendments to the Purchase and Sale Agreement__.

(a) Each reference to "CONSOL Sales Company" in the Purchase and Sale
Agreement shall be deemed a reference to "CONSOL Energy Sales Company".

(b) The "Definitions" paragraph of the Purchase and Sale Agreement shall be
hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

"Unless otherwise indicated, certain terms that are capitalized and used
throughout this Agreement are defined in Exhibit I to the Amended and Restated
Receivables Purchase Agreement dated as of April 30, 2007 (as the same may be
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "
_Receivables Purchase Agreement_ ") by and among CONSOL Energy Inc., as
Servicer, the Company, the Sub-Servicers party thereto, the Conduit Purchasers
party thereto, the Purchaser Agents party thereto, the financial institutions
from time to time party thereto, as LC Participants, and PNC Bank, National
Association, as the Administrator (in such capacity, the " _Administrator_ ")
and LC    Bank (in such capacity, the " _LC Bank_ "). All references herein to months
are to calendar months unless otherwise expressly indicated." 

(c) The Purchase and Sale Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the
following new Section 3.2A immediately after  _Section 3.2_ and before
_Section 3.3_ to read as follows:

"3.2A _Letters of Credit_. 

(a) Upon the request of Consol Energy (acting as agent for the Originators as
described in subsection (b) below), and subject to the terms and conditions
for issuing Letters of Credit under the Receivables Purchase Agreement
(including any limitations therein on the amount of any such issuance), the
Company agrees to cause the LC Bank to issue, on the Purchase Dates specified
by Consol Energy, Letters of Credit in favor of the beneficiaries specified by
Consol Energy. The aggregate stated amount of the Letters of Credit being
issued on any Purchase Date shall constitute a credit against the
aggregate Purchase Price otherwise payable by the Company on such Purchase
Date pursuant to _Section 3.2_. To the extent that the aggregate stated
amount of the Letters of Credit being issued on any Payment Date exceeds the
aggregate Purchase Price payable by the Company on such Payment Date, such
excess shall be deemed to be a reduction in the outstanding principal balance
of (and, to the extent necessary, the accrued but unpaid interest on) the
Company Notes specified by Consol Energy. The aggregate stated amount of
Letters of Credit to be issued on any Payment Date cannot exceed the sum of
the aggregate Purchase Price payable on such Payment Date plus the aggregate
outstanding principal balance of and accrued but unpaid interest on the
Company Notes on such Payment Date. In the event that any Letter of Credit
issued pursuant to this _Section 3.2A_ (i) expires or is cancelled or
otherwise terminated with all or any portion of its stated amount
undrawn, (ii) has its stated amount decreased (for a reason other than a
drawing having been made thereunder) or (iii) the Companys Reimbursement
Obligation in respect thereof is reduced for any reason other than by virtue
of a payment made in respect of a drawing thereunder, then an amount equal to
such undrawn amount or such reduction, as the case may be, shall either be
paid in cash to the relevant Originator(s) on the next Payment Date or, if the
Company does not then have cash available therefor, shall be deemed to be
added to the outstanding principal amount of the Company Note(s) issued to
such Originator(s). Under no circumstances shall Consol Energy or any
Originator have any reimbursement obligations in respect of any Letter of
Credit."

"(b) Each Originator appoints Consol Energy as its agent (on which appointment
the Company, the Servicer, the Sub-Servicers, the Purchaser Agents, the
Administrator, the LC Bank, the LC Participants and the Purchasers may rely
until the relevant Originator provides contrary written notice to all of such
Persons) to act on such Originators behalf to take all actions and to make
all decisions in respect of the issuance, amendment and administration of the
Letters of Credit, including requests for the issuance and extension of
Letters of Credit and the allocation of the stated amounts of Letters of
Credit against Purchase Price owed to particular Originators and against
Company Notes issued to particular Originators. In the event that Consol
Energy  



 

2  requests a Letter of Credit hereunder, Consol Energy shall on a timely basis
provide the Company with such information as is necessary for the Company
to obtain such Letter of Credit from the LC Bank, and shall notify the
relevant Originators, the Company and the Administrator of the allocations
described in the preceding sentence. Such allocations shall be binding on the
Company and each Originator."

(d) _Exhibit E_ of the Purchase and Sale Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety as _Exhibit E_ attached hereto.

(e) _Exhibit F_ of the Purchase and Sale Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety as  _Exhibit F_ attached hereto.

3\. __Representations and Warranties__. Each of the Originators and the
Company represents and warrants that:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. Each representation and warranty made by
it in the Purchase and Sale Agreement and in the other Transaction Documents
are true and correct as of the date hereof.

(b) _No Default_. Both immediately before and immediately after giving effect
to this Amendment and the transactions contemplated hereby, no Purchase and
Sale Termination Event or Unmatured Purchase and Sale Termination Event exists
or shall exist.

(c) _Fair Market Value_. The Purchase Price for the Receivables sold pursuant
to the Purchase and Sale Agreement reflects the fair market value of such
Receivables.

4\. __Effect of Amendment__. All provisions of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement, as expressly amended and modified by this Amendment, shall remain
in full force and effect. After this Amendment becomes effective, all
references in the Purchase and Sale Agreement (or in any other Transaction
Document) to the "Purchase and Sale Agreement", or to "hereof", "herein" or
words of similar effect referring to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, shall be
deemed to be references to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as amended by this
Amendment.

5\. __Effectiveness__. This Amendment shall become effective upon satisfaction
of each of the following conditions precedent on and as of the date hereof:

(a) Receipt by the parties hereto of counterparts of this Amendment (whether
by facsimile or otherwise) executed by each of the other parties hereto; and

(b) Such other documents, instruments and opinions as the Administrator may
reasonably request.

6\. __Counterparts__. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to  



 

3  be an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute but one
and the same instrument.

7\. __Governing Law__. This Amendment shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York (including for
such purpose Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the General Obligations Law of the
State of New York).

8\. __Section Headings__. The various headings of this Amendment are included
for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Amendment, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, any other Transaction
Document or any provision hereof or thereof.

9\. __Consents and Agreements__. (a) By their consents and agreements to this
Amendment set forth in the signature pages hereto, the Purchasers hereby
agree that the Company Notes will be deemed to be modified to permit the
increases and decreases of the amounts outstanding under the Company Notes as
contemplated by Section 3.2A of the Purchase and Sale Agreement as amended by
this Amendment.

(b) CONSOL Pennsylvania Coal Company (" _CONSOL Pennsylvania_ ")
hereby informs the Administrator and the Company of its intent to convert
from a corporation to a limited liability company on or about June 1, 2007
(the " _Conversion_ "). The Administrator and the Company hereby consent to
the Conversion, provided that, within a reasonable time after the Conversion,
(i) there shall be delivered to the Administrator copies of (1) the
certificate of conversion to limited liability company for CONSOL
Pennsylvania, certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and (2) any and all other documentation related to the conversion of CONSOL
Pennsylvania to a limited liability company, as requested by the
Administrator; (ii) there shall be delivered to the Administrator a true,
correct and complete copy of the limited liability company agreement for
CONSOL Pennsylvania; and (iii) CONSOL Energy shall cause all amendments to
financing statements, or original financing statements, necessitated by the
Conversion to have been filed in each jurisdiction in which the filing thereof
is required or requested by the Administrator, and each such financing
statement shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrator.
