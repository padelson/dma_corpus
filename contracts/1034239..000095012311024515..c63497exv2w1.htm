 _THE OFFER_  

  

 SECTION 1.01 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 and none of the events set forth in paragraphs (a)(g) of Annex I hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, on the date that is the 10th Business Day after the date of this Agreement, MergerSub shall, and Parent shall cause MergerSub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase for cash all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the Offer Price. The initial Expiration Date of the Offer shall be 12 midnight, New York City time, at the end of the 20th Business Day following commencement of the Offer. The obligations of MergerSub to, and of Parent to cause MergerSub to, accept for payment and to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered on or prior to the expiration of the Offer and not validly withdrawn shall be subject only to (i) there being validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to any shares of Company Common Stock already owned by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, if any, represents at least a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on a Fully-Diluted Basis, excluding shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). MergerSub expressly reserves the right, from time to time, to waive any of the Offer Conditions or to make other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the Company, MergerSub shall not (A) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (B) decrease the Offer Price, (C) decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the Offer, (D) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (E) impose conditions to the Offer that are in addition to the Offer Conditions, (F) extend the Expiration Date of the Offer in any manner other than as permitted in this Section 1.01 or (G) amend any of the terms and conditions of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (u) if there shall have been one or more Extension Excluded Parties as of the Extension Excluded Party Notice Date and the Company shall have delivered to Parent the written notice identifying such Extension Excluded Party in accordance with Section 5.03(b), MergerSub shall extend the Offer until the first Business Day following the Cut-off Date, (v) if on the initial Expiration Date of the Offer or on any subsequent scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer, all Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived, MergerSub may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer for one or more periods of not more than five (5) Business Days each beyond such Expiration Date, provided, however, that MergerSub shall not be entitled to extend the Offer to any date occurring after the Termination Date, (w) MergerSub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer, (x) MergerSub shall extend the Offer for one or more periods of no more than five (5) Business Days each (or such longer period as the parties hereto agree) until the condition set forth in clause (ii) of the first paragraph of Annex I related to the HSR Act and Foreign Antitrust Laws is satisfied or waived; provided, however, that in no event shall MergerSub be required to extend 

   ##### 

  

    

the Offer (1) beyond the Termination Date or (2) at any time that Parent or
MergerSub is permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII,
(y) if on any scheduled Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition is not
satisfied but all other Offer Conditions are satisfied, then MergerSub shall
extend the Offer on a single occasion for a five (5) Business Day period;
provided, however, that in no event shall MergerSub be required to extend the
Offer (1) beyond the Termination Date or (2) at any time that Parent or
MergerSub is permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII,
and (z) MergerSub may, in its sole discretion, provide a "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (a "
_Subsequent Offering Period_ ") of not more than twenty (20) Business Days to
meet the objective that there be validly tendered, in accordance with
the terms of the Offer, prior to the Expiration Date and not validly
withdrawn, a number of shares of Company Common Stock, which when added to
any shares of Company Common Stock already owned by Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries, represent at least 90% of the then outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock at the Offer Closing (including following the
exercise of the Top-Up Option at Parent or MergerSubs option). In addition,
MergerSub may increase the Offer Price and extend the Offer to the extent
required by applicable Law in connection with such increase in each case in
its sole discretion and without the Companys consent. Subject to the prior
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the prior satisfaction or waiver by
Parent or MergerSub (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the
other Offer Conditions, MergerSub shall, and Parent shall cause MergerSub to,
in accordance with the terms of the Offer, consummate the Offer and accept
for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly (within the meaning
of Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after expiration of the
Offer (subject to the provisions of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, to
the extent applicable). The Offer Price shall be net to the seller in cash,
without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.
Acceptance for payment of the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and
subject to the conditions of the Offer after the expiration of the Offer is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ", and the date on
which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Offer Closing Date_ ". If the payment of the Offer Price is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the tendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so
tendered be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Offer Price
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate tendered, or
required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting Person,
or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and MergerSub that
such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. 

  

 (b) MergerSub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII, MergerSub shall, and Parent shall cause MergerSub to, promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, and MergerSub shall not in the event of any such termination pursuant to Article VIII acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated by MergerSub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, MergerSub shall promptly (within the meaning of Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act) return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of 

   ##### 

  

    

MergerSub to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all shares of Company
Common Stock that have been tendered in the Offer to the registered holders
thereof. 

  

 (c) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and MergerSub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall include the offer to purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal and notice of guaranteed delivery and all other required or appropriate ancillary Offer documents (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Subject to the Companys compliance with Section 1.02(c), Parent and MergerSub shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. Parent and MergerSub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. MergerSub further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws.

In addition, Parent and MergerSub agree to: (i) provide the Company and its counsel with any comments or communications that Parent, MergerSub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after Parents or MergerSubs, as the case may be, receipt of such comments or communications, (ii) cooperate with the Company and its counsel in responding to such comments or communications, and (iii) use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to such comments. 

  

 (d) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to MergerSub on a timely basis the consideration necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that MergerSub becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause MergerSub to fulfill all of MergerSubs obligations under this Agreement.

The Company, Parent and MergerSub agree to disseminate the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock together in the same mailing or other form of distribution. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are

 SECTION 1.03 _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to MergerSub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, a number (but not less than that number) of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, MergerSub or any of the other Parent Subsidiaries, at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share of Company Common Stock more than ninety percent (90%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Option may be exercised, in whole but not in part, at any one time on or after the date MergerSub accepts for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and prior to the earlier to occur of (1) the Effective Time and (2) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01; provided, however, that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (A) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or MergerSub constitutes one share of Company Common Stock more than ninety percent (90%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares and (B) the number of Top-Up Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall in no event exceed the number of authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock not otherwise reserved for issuance. 

  

 (b) Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with Section 1.03(a), MergerSub shall so notify the Company and shall set forth in such notice (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock expected to be owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or MergerSub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, (2) the number of Top-Up Option Shares, and (3) a place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Closing_ "). At the Top-Up Option Closing, MergerSub shall pay the Company the aggregate purchase price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to this Section 1.03, and the Company shall cause to be issued to MergerSub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. At its election, MergerSub may pay the aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares either (A) in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company, or (B) by (i) paying in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company, an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares less the amount paid 

   ##### 

  

    

in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (i) (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The
Promissory Note (A) shall be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up

therein and such failure continues for a period of 30 days or (y) MergerSub
files or has filed against it any petition under bankruptcy or insolvency
law or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors and (F) shall
have no other material terms. 

  

 (c) Parent and MergerSub understand that the shares of Company Common Stock that MergerSub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. MergerSub agrees that any Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will be acquired for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act, and that any certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares may include any legends required by applicable securities laws. 

  

 (d) The parties agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to Dissenting Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the fair value of the Dissenting Shares shall be determined in accordance with Section 262(h) of the DGCL without regard to the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or any consideration paid or delivered by MergerSub to the Company in payment for the Top-Up Option Shares. 

  

 SECTION 1.04 _Directors_. 

  

 (a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Parent pursuant to this Section 1.04(a)) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by MergerSub, Parent and any of the other Parent Subsidiaries bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (on a Fully-Diluted Basis). The Company shall, upon Parents request, either take all actions necessary to promptly increase the size of the Company Board, or promptly secure the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board, and shall take all actions necessary to cause Parents designees to be so elected or designated at such time. At such time, the Company shall, upon Parents request, also cause Persons elected or designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary, and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board. The Companys obligations under this Section 

   ##### 

  

    

1.04(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under
this Section 1.04(a), including mailing to stockholders (together with the
Schedule 14D-9) the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as
is necessary to enable Parents designees to be elected or designated to the
Company Board. Parent or MergerSub shall supply the Company with
information with respect to either of them and their nominees, officers,
directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1. 

  

 (b) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.04(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors, or the sole Continuing Director if there only be one Continuing Director, shall be required in order to (i) amend, modify or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or MergerSub under this Agreement, (iii) waive or exercise any of the Companys rights under this Agreement or (iv) amend the Companys certificate of incorporation or by-laws in any manner that would adversely affect the Companys stockholders. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the reasonable expense of the Company for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations hereunder, and shall have the authority following the election of Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.04(a), to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement or in accordance with its terms. For purposes of this Section 1.04(b), " _Continuing Director_ " shall mean a member of the Company Board who was a member of the Company Board as of immediately prior to payment by MergerSub for shares pursuant to the Offer; provided, however, that if prior to the Effective Time there shall be no Continuing Director for any reason, the other members of the Company Board shall designate a person to serve as a member of the Company Board who is not an officer, employee, director or designee of Parent or any of its affiliates and who is an "independent director" as defined by the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules (and such person designated shall be considered a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement).

From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such Company Common Stock has been converted pursuant hereto upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.12, without interest thereon. 

  

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, MergerSub or any direct or indirect wholly owned Parent Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MergerSub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully-paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation held by the same holder thereof and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of MergerSub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders of the Company who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights Provisions_ ") (i) have not voted or consented to adopt and approve this Agreement and (ii) shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for 

   ##### 

  

    

such shares, and not effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect their
rights to appraisal (collectively, the " _Appraisal Shares_ "), will not be
converted as described in Section 2.11(a), but at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the
right to receive only those rights provided under the Appraisal Rights
Provisions; provided, however, that all shares of Company Common Stock held
by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under the
Appraisal Rights Provisions shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled
and retired and to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in
Section 2.11(a) upon surrender of the Certificates representing such shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.12. Persons who have perfected
appraisal rights under the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect
to Appraisal Shares as aforesaid will not receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Agreement and will have only such rights as are provided by
the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect to such Appraisal Shares. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock and withdrawals and attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to rights of appraisal, and Parent shall have the right
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands
or approve any withdrawal of such demands. 

  

 (e) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Offer Price, Merger Consideration, Option/SAR Cancellation Value and RSU Cancellation Value shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Offer Price, Merger Consideration, Option/SAR Cancellation Value and RSU Cancellation Value, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence; provided that this Section 2.11(e) shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any breach by the Company of Section 5.01. 

  

 SECTION 2.12 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and such deposit shall be solely for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Appraisal Shares), for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Paying Agent, available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.11(a) (such cash being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") in exchange for the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or personally deliver to each holder of record (or his or her attorney-in-fact) of a Certificate or Certificates, whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.11(a), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall (A) include an accompanying IRS Form W-9 (or substitute IRS Form W-9) and IRS Form W-8BEN, (B) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and (C) be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. After the Effective Time and upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as reasonably may be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant hereto, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled and the Merger Consideration shall be sent promptly to such holder. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any Merger Consideration to be delivered upon surrender of the Certificates. If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and MergerSub that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.12, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant hereto, without interest thereon. 

  

 (c) _No Further Rights in the Shares_. All Merger Consideration paid upon conversion of the shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any cash (including any interest or earnings received with respect thereto) that is held in the Exchange Fund and that has not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, MergerSub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate which is delivered to a public official as required by applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the 

   ##### 

  

    

related Merger Consideration would, pursuant to applicable Law, escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such time, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
Claims and interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Paying Agent, MergerSub, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of Company Stock Rights such amounts as it is required by Law to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local, or foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Rights, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 (f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any Claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate. 

  

 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis, provided that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this Article II or affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund, and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days, or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively (or funds that invest in such obligations). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and shall be paid to Parent as provided in Section 2.12(d). 

  

 SECTION 2.13 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable 

   ##### 

  

    

Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any reason shall be canceled
and converted into the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article
II. 

  

 SECTION 2.14 _Treatment of Company Stock Rights; ESPP_. 

  

 (a) Effective not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate all Company Stock Plans. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to effect the following: 

   

 (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, but conditioned upon the Merger, except as set forth in Exhibit C, each share of Company Restricted Stock shall become fully vested and free of restrictions and shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.11(a); 

   

 (ii) except as set forth in Exhibit C, at the Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled in full and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such cancellation (the " _RSU Cancellation Value_ ") a cash payment equal to the product of the target number of shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration, which RSU Cancellation Value shall be payable to such holder immediately following the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation (or, if such Company RSU is subject to Section 409A of the Code, at such later date provided by the terms of such Company RSU); and 

   

 (iii) except as set forth in Exhibit C, at the Effective Time, each Company Option and each Company SAR outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be canceled in full and cease to exist and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such cancellation (the " _Option/SAR Cancellation Value_ ") a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to such Company Option or Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) (x) the Merger Consideration reduced by (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option or Company SAR, which Option/SAR Cancellation Value shall be payable by the Surviving Corporation to such holder immediately following the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) The ESPP shall continue to be operated in accordance with its terms and past practice for the Offering (as defined in the ESPP) that is in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Current Offering_ "). Promptly upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, subject to applicable Law, suspend the commencement of any future Offerings under the ESPP unless and until this Agreement is terminated and shall terminate the ESPP as of the Closing Date. In the event the Offering Termination Date (as defined in the ESPP) for the 

   ##### 

  

    

Current Offering (the " _Current Offering Termination Date_ ") occurs
following the Effective Time, the holder of each option then outstanding
under the ESPP will be entitled to receive at the Current Offering Termination
Date upon the exercise of such option for each share as to which such option
shall be exercised, as nearly as reasonably may be determined, a cash payment
equal to the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be subject to any required withholding taxes as provided in Section 2.12(e) and shall be paid without interest.

 (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the Liability of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient in all material respects to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Effective Time, with respect to all current and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan and no transaction shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be materially less than such benefit obligations; and

   ##### 

  

    

on the number of shares of Company Common Stock tendered or to be tendered
into the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. The Company also
represents and warrants that (i) the adoption, approval, amendment or
modification of each Arrangement, including the New Employment Agreements to
which it is a party, since the discussions relating to the Transactions

Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto and
(ii) the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is otherwise

Agreement of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board or its "independent directors" as defined by
Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. A correct and complete copy

 SECTION 5.03 _No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the 30th calendar day following the date of this Agreement (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ "), the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall have the right (acting under the direction of the Company Board), directly or indirectly, to: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce and facilitate, whether publicly or 

    ##### 

  

 

otherwise, Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or offers or other
efforts or attempts that are reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal), including by way of providing access to nonpublic information,
provided, however, that the Company shall only permit such information to be
provided pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which
shall be provided by the Company to Parent promptly after its execution);

On the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice identifying each Excluded Party as of such date and a summary of the Company Boards reasons for such determination. On the day that is one (1) Business Day prior to the initial scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer (the " _Extension Excluded Party Notice Date_ "), the Company shall provide Parent with written notice identifying each Extension Excluded Party and a summary of the Company Boards reasons for such determination. The parties agree that, notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations of the Company under this Section 5.03(b) from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 5.03(a) with an Excluded Party (and any of its Representatives) or an Extension Excluded Party (and any of its Representatives), as applicable, with respect to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Excluded Party or Extension Excluded Party prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date that constitutes or is reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal, including with respect to any such amended or revised proposal submitted by such Excluded Party or 

    ##### 

  

 

Extension Excluded Party, for as long as such Person is an Excluded Party or
Extension Excluded Party, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, (i) any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded
Party for all purposes under this Agreement upon the earlier of (w) 5:00 pm
(New York City time) on the Extension Excluded Party Notice Date or (x)
immediately at such time as such Acquisition Proposal made by such party is
withdrawn, terminated, expires or no longer constitutes or is no longer
reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (ii) any Extension
Excluded Party shall cease to be an Extension Excluded Party for all purposes
under this Agreement upon the earlier of (y) 5:00 pm. (New York City time) on
the 15th calendar day following the No-Shop Period Start Date (the " _Cut-off
Date_ ") or (z) immediately at such time as such Acquisition Proposal made by
such party is withdrawn, terminated, expires or no longer constitutes or is no
longer reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.03(b) or any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the Offer Closing, the Company receives, on an unsolicited basis and in the absence of any violation of this Section 5.03 relating thereto, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may take the following actions prior to the Offer Closing: (A) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent promptly after its execution) and subject to the other restrictions imposed by Section 5.03(a)(i) and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party and its Representatives with respect to the Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (d) At all times from and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty four-hours and substantially concurrently with providing any such Person with any non-public information) orally and in writing notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives, in each case, in connection with, or which would reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall identify the name of the Person making such inquiry, proposal or request or seeking such negotiations or discussions and the material terms and conditions of such inquiry, proposal or request and include copies of all correspondence and written materials provided to the Company or any of its Representatives that describe any material terms and conditions of any such inquiry, proposal or request (and any subsequent material changes to such terms and conditions). The Company shall (i) promptly keep Parent fully informed, in all material respects, of the status and details of any Acquisition Proposal or inquiries related thereto (including any changes in the material terms thereof) and (ii) promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent and its outside legal counsel with copies of all drafts and final versions (and any comments thereon) of agreements (including schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any Acquisition Proposal exchanged 

    ##### 

  

 

between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal or any of its Representatives, on the
other hand. 

   

 (e) Except as permitted by this Section 5.03(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or MergerSub, or resolve to or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or MergerSub, the Company Recommendation or otherwise take any action or make any statement in connection with the Transactions that is inconsistent with the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or resolve to or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing actions in clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or (iii) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding or non-binding letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement, commitment, arrangement or understanding contemplating or otherwise in connection with, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement referred to in Sections 5.03(a) and (c)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may prior to the Offer Closing (A) in response to information obtained after the date of this Agreement and that was not reasonably capable of being known by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, make a Change of Recommendation if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law or (B) in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company after the date of this Agreement and in the absence of any violation of this Section 5.03 relating thereto, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) and concurrently with such termination cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, subject to satisfaction of its obligations under Section 8.03, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Recommendation or exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) until after the fourth Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Section 5.03(e) Notice_") (it being understood and agreed that a Section 5.03(e) Notice, any resolution or determination of the Company Board to make a Section 5.03(e) Notice or negotiations with Parent relating thereto as provided below in this Section 5.03(e) shall not be deemed to constitute a Change of Recommendation) from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) and specifying the reasons therefor, including, if the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board is a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal and a copy of the proposed transaction agreement for any such Superior Proposal in the form to be  entered into (it being understood and agreed that, in the event of an amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall not be entitled to exercise such right based on such Superior Proposal, as so amended, until after the second full Business Day following Parents receipt of a new Section 5.03(e) Notice from the Company with respect 

    ##### 

  

 

to such Superior Proposal as so amended). In determining whether to terminate
this Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal or to make a Change of
Recommendation, the Company Board shall take into account any proposals made
by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement, shall cause the Companys
financial adviser and legal counsel to negotiate in good faith with Parent
regarding any such proposals and shall not make a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement unless, prior to the effectiveness of such Change
of Recommendation or termination, the Company Board, after considering the
results of any such negotiations and any revised proposals made by Parent,
concludes that it continues to meet the requirements to make a Change of
Recommendation under clause (A) above and/or that the Superior Proposal
giving rise to the Section 5.03(e) Notice continues to be a Superior Proposal
and that it continues to meet the requirements to terminate this agreement
under clause (B) above. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a tender offer or exchange offer so long as the requirements set forth in this Section 5.03 are satisfied, provided that such rules shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules may otherwise have under this Agreement (including any such action which may constitute a Change of Recommendation, it being understood that a statement made pursuant to this Section 5.03(f) other than issuance by the Company of a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act that does not expressly reaffirm the Company Recommendation shall be deemed a Change of Recommendation).

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company, Parent and MergerSub shall each use reasonable best efforts to as promptly as reasonably practicable: (a) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Transactions; (b) obtain all Permits, waivers or authorizations required under Law (including all rulings and approvals of Governmental Authorities and consents from parties to Contracts) in connection with the authorization, execution, and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by them of the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger; (c) defend any proceeding challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order vacated or reversed; and (d) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under the HSR Act or required under any Foreign Antitrust Laws; provided, that Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions, or changes suggested in connection therewith. The Company and Parent shall furnish all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, each of 

   ##### 

  

    

the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) make or cause to be made
the applications or filings required to be made by Parent, MergerSub or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries under or with respect to the
HSR Act in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions
as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and in any event within
10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and concurrently with such
filing or as soon as practicable thereafter, request early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable
date with any request under or with respect to the HSR Act or
Foreign Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents or other
materials received by Parent or the Company or any of their respective

or any other Governmental Authority in connection with such applications or
filings or the Transactions and (iii) reasonably coordinate and cooperate
with each other party in the making of any applications or filings (including

such application or filing), or obtaining any approvals, required in
connection with the Transactions under the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Laws.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, Parent shall have the right to
take the lead in any communications or meetings with, and any dealings with,
any third Person or Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining any
such approvals, consents, Orders, exemptions or waivers, and the Company shall
not take any actions, including entering into any agreements, arrangements or
understandings, in connection therewith without the prior written consent of
Parent. Each Party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any
communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the Transactions unless otherwise prohibited by Law. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, in connection with the receipt of any
necessary approvals under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Laws, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be required to divest or hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Parents or the
Companys freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any
of the businesses, product lines, or properties of the Company or Parent,
except for any such action as would be immaterial to Parent, the Company or
the economic or business benefits of the Transactions to Parent. 

  

 SECTION 6.02 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent after obtaining Knowledge of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, as the case may be, would be reasonably likely to cause any condition set forth in Section 7.01 or Annex I to not be satisfied at any time as a result of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement being untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company after obtaining Knowledge of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, as the case may be, would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect as a result of any representation or warranty of Parent or MergerSub contained in this Agreement being untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or any failure of Parent or MergerSub to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the representations or warranties or covenants of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 6.03 _Public Announcements_. The parties shall issue a joint press release, mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent, promptly after the date hereof. Thereafter, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and with mutual consent of both Parent and the Company, except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with NASDAQ or the rules of a securities exchange or trading market, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such release or announcement in advance of its issuance; provided, however, that the Company will no longer be required to obtain the prior consent of or consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or public announcement if the Company Board has effected a Change of Recommendation. 

  

 SECTION 6.04 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each Company Subsidiary to provide to those individuals employed by the Surviving Corporation or by one or more of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, a " _Retained Employee_ " and collectively, the " _Retained Employees_ ") salary and benefits under employee benefit plans (other than defined benefit pension plans, plans providing for retiree medical benefits, incentive pay plans, plans that provide equity-based compensation and plans that provide for payments or benefits upon a change in control) which are substantially no less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits provided by the Company and any Company Subsidiary to Retained Employees under the Employee Benefit Plans listed in Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule as in effect immediately before the Effective Time (excluding defined benefit pension plans, plans providing for retiree medical benefits, incentive pay plans, plans that provide equity-based compensation and plans that provide for payments or benefits under a change in control); provided, however, that Retained Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall not be subject to the foregoing sentence, but shall be subject to the applicable collective bargaining agreement. 

   

 (b) Effective upon the Effective Time, to the extent any employee benefit plan, program, or policy of Parent or Parent Subsidiary is made available to the Retained Employees: (i) service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (to the same extent such service is recognized under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or its affiliates prior to the Closing) by any Retained Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited in determining such employees eligibility, vesting and benefit levels, provided, however, that (x) such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit under any plan, or (y) require the crediting of past service for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan and (ii) with respect to any welfare benefit plans in which such Retained Employees may become eligible to participate, Parent shall cause such plans to provide credit for any co-payments or deductibles by such employees paid in respect of the plan year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing, they participate in any other plan for which deductibles or co-payments are required and waive any pre-existing condition exclusions which were waived under the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing and waiting periods, other than waiting periods 

    ##### 

  

 

that have not been satisfied under any welfare plans maintained by the Company
for Retained Employees prior to the Effective Time. The requirement of this
Section 6.04(b) shall not apply to any Retained Employee covered by a
collective bargaining agreement, it being understood that the terms of the
applicable collective bargaining agreement covering each such Retained
Employee shall apply. 

   

 (c) Nothing in this Section 6.04, whether express or implied, shall (i) confer any rights upon any or remedies of any kind or description upon any Retained Employee or any other Person other than the Company and Parent and their respective successors and permitted assigns; (ii) constitute or create an employment agreement or otherwise contravene any employment-at-will relationship; (iii) constitute or be treated as an amendment, waiver, modification or adoption of any Employee Benefit Plan; (iv) prevent the amendment, modification or termination of any Employee Benefit Plan or interfere with the right or obligation of Parent or its affiliates to make such changes to the foregoing as are necessary to conform with applicable Law; or (v) limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their respective affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee at any time or require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to continue to employ any Retained Employees for any period of time following the Effective Time or otherwise to treat any such employee on any basis other than as an employee-at-will. 

   

 (d) The Company shall not, during the period prior to the Effective Time, make any written or other communication to its employees relating to employee, compensation or benefits without the prior approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

   

 (e) Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to expressly assume those Employee Benefit Plans listed on Section 6.04(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (f) Prior to the Closing, the Company and all Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall fully comply with all notice, consultation, effects bargaining or other bargaining obligations to any labor union, labor organization, works council or group of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions. In connection with the foregoing, the Company, on behalf of itself and all Company Subsidiaries, shall periodically consult with Parent and keep Parent informed. 

   

 SECTION 6.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Each of Parent, MergerSub and the Surviving Corporation agrees that all rights to indemnification, advance and reimbursement of expenses, or exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each present and former director or officer of the Company with respect to acts or omissions arising on or before the Effective Time provided for in its Organizational Documents or in Contracts in effect as of the date hereof and disclosed to Parent shall continue in full force and effect after the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with their obligations that correspond to such rights. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to acts or omissions arising on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts containing terms no less favorable to such directors or officers; provided further, however, that, after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium for the Companys existing policies in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto (which annual premium is set forth on Section 6.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as may be purchased for such amount. The Company may purchase, prior to the Offer Closing Date, or Parent may purchase or cause the Company to purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions; provided that the cost of such "tail" policy purchased by the Company prior to the Offer Closing Date shall not exceed 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained, from and after the Effective Time Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder. 

   

 (c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the applicable obligations set forth in this section. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each director, officer or other Person referred to herein, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. 

   

 SECTION 6.06 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section 2.14 and any other dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 SECTION 6.07 _Approval of Compensation Arrangements_. If the Company enters into, adopts, amends, modifies or terminates any Arrangements, including the New Employment Agreements to which it is a party, with Covered Securityholders, all such amounts payable under such Arrangements (i) shall be paid or granted as compensation for past services 

   ##### 

  

    

performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be refrained
from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters incidental
thereto) and (ii) shall not be calculated based on the number of shares of
Company Common Stock tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the
applicable Covered Securityholder. Moreover, the Company shall take all
actions necessary so that, prior to the Expiration Date: (i) the adoption,
approval, amendment or modification of each such Arrangement, including the
New Employment Agreements to which it is a party, shall be approved as an
employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement
solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto and (ii) the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is
otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the
Expiration Date of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the
Compensation Committee of such Company Board or its "independent directors"
as defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. 

  

 SECTION 6.08 _Third Party Standstill Agreements_ During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company shall enforce to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (including obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court or other tribunal having jurisdiction) and shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any standstill provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement between the Company and other parties; provided, however, (a) from the date of this Agreement until the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may grant any such waiver solely to the extent necessary to permit any counterparty to any such agreement to make non-public submissions of Acquisition Proposals or amendments thereto to the Company Board prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and (b) at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Offer Closing, the Company may grant any such waiver if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to grant such waiver would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law. The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of the waiver or release of any standstill by the Company. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date of this Agreement which does not expressly permit, or which contains any provision that adversely affects the rights of the Company under such confidentiality agreement upon, compliance by the Company with any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.09 _State Takeover Laws_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will not take any action that would cause the Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company or the Transactions, then the Company Board shall take all actions necessary to render such Takeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing. 

  

 SECTION 6.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive officers relating to the Transactions, whether commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement against the Company or any of its directors or executive officers
by any stockholder of the Company relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger, any other Transaction or otherwise, without the prior written consent
of Parent. 

  

 SECTION 6.11 _Financial Information and Cooperation_. During the period prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide to Parent consolidated monthly financial statements and its complete monthly internal financial reporting package no later than 20 calendar days following the end of each fiscal month. The Company shall use, and shall cause its Representatives to use, their reasonable best efforts to cooperate and assist Parent and MergerSub with respect to the arrangement of Parents financing (the " _Financing_ "). Further, the Company shall provide, and shall cause the Representatives of the Company to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement and consummation of the Financing, including (a) promptly providing to Parents or MergerSubs financing sources all material financial and other pertinent information with respect to the Company and the Transactions reasonably requested by Parent, including information and projections prepared by the Company relating to the Company and the Transactions, (b) causing the Companys senior officers and other Representatives to be reasonably available to Parents or MergerSubs financing sources in connection with such Financing, to participate in due diligence sessions, meetings and drafting sessions and to participate in presentations related to the Financing, including presentations to rating agencies, (c) assisting, and using its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to assist, in the preparation of one or more appropriate offering documents (including the preparation of pro forma financial statements meeting the requirements of SEC Regulation S-X) and assisting Parents or MergerSubs financing sources in preparing and delivering other appropriate marketing and closing materials, in each case to be used in connection with the Financing, (d) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any of the Financing, (e) providing and executing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters and assisting Parent in obtaining comfort letters of the Companys accountants, consents of the Companys accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Financing, and legal opinions of the Companys counsel, and (f) reasonably facilitating the pledge of the Companys assets as collateral. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing. Parent (i) acknowledges and agrees that the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not incur any Liability to any Person prior to Effective Time under the Financing and (ii) shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or reasonable expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection therewith, except (A) with respect to any information provided by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in writing for inclusion in customary offering documents and any historical financial information relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries contained in any Company SEC Documents and (B) for any of the foregoing to the extent the same is the result of willful misconduct or bad faith of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their respective Representatives. 

  

 SECTION 6.12 _Stock Exchange De-listing; Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or 

   ##### 

  

    

advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of
NASDAQ to cause the delisting of the Company and of the Company Common Stock
from NASDAQ as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after such delisting. Prior to April 15, 2011, the Company
shall amend its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2010 to include the information required to be set forth in Part III thereof
without reliance on incorporation by reference to the Companys proxy
statement for its 2011 annual meeting of stockholders.

 (a) Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, if this Agreement is terminated: 

    

 (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(g);

   ##### 

  

    

after the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Transaction is
consummated or a definitive agreement is entered into by the
Company providing for an Acquisition Transaction, 

 

then in each such case the Company shall pay Parent (or MergerSub, as directed
by Parent) the Termination Fee. As used herein, the " _Termination Fee_
" shall mean a cash amount equal to $20,940,000; except in the event that
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(h) (I)

the "Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to $11,280,000. 

   

 (b) If the Termination Fee becomes payable, the Company shall make payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. The Termination Fee shall be paid within one (1) Business Day after termination of this Agreement in the case of the occurrence of any event described in clause (i) of Section 8.03(a) above, concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in the case of the occurrence of any event described in clause (ii) of Section 8.03(a) above, and upon the date the Acquisition Transaction is consummated in the case of the occurrence of any event described in clause (iii) of Section 8.03(a) above. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall not withhold any withholding Taxes on any payment under this Section 8.03. 

   

 (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.03 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, the Termination Fee shall be deemed to include the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Parent (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 8.03, together with interest on such unpaid Termination Fee, commencing on the date that the Termination Fee became due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Bank of America from time to time as such banks prime rate plus two percent (2%). 

   

 SECTION 8.04 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which would (a) reduce the amount or change the type of consideration into which each share of Company Common Stock shall be converted pursuant to this Agreement upon consummation of the Merger or (b) alter or change any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement if any of such alterations or changes, alone or in the aggregate, would require approval of the Companys stockholders under the DGCL. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. 

  

 SECTION 8.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained 

    ##### 

 

  

herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party hereto
to exercise any right, power or remedy provided under this Agreement
or otherwise in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon
compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any
custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall
not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such
or other right, power or remedy or demand such compliance.
