</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. It is proposed that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,

such higher price per share of Company Common Stock as may be paid in the Offer, is referred to
herein as the &#147;<U>Offer Price</U>&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. It is proposed that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;<U>DGCL</U>&#148;), following the
consummation of the Offer, MergerSub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section
8.01 and none of the events set forth in paragraphs (a)&#151;(g) of Annex I hereto shall have occurred
and be continuing, on the date that is the 10<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> Business Day after the date of this
Agreement, MergerSub shall, and Parent shall cause MergerSub to, commence (within the meaning of

of the Offer. The obligations of MergerSub to, and of Parent to cause MergerSub to, accept for

Company Common Stock which, when added to any shares of Company Common Stock already owned by
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, if any, represents at least a majority of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding on a Fully-Diluted Basis, excluding shares of Company Common Stock
tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures (the &#147;<U>Minimum Condition</U>&#148;)
and (ii)&nbsp;the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the other
conditions set forth in Annex I hereto (collectively, the &#147;<U>Offer Conditions</U>&#148;). MergerSub
expressly reserves the right, from time to time, to waive any of the Offer Conditions or to make
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that without the prior
written consent of the Company, MergerSub shall not (A)&nbsp;amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (B)
decrease the Offer Price, (C)&nbsp;decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the
Offer, (D)&nbsp;change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (E)&nbsp;impose conditions to the
Offer that are in addition to the Offer Conditions, (F)&nbsp;extend the Expiration Date of the Offer in
any manner other than as permitted in this Section&nbsp;1.01 or (G)&nbsp;amend any of the terms and
conditions of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (u)&nbsp;if there shall have been one or more Extension Excluded Parties
as of the Extension Excluded Party Notice Date and the Company shall have delivered to Parent the
written notice identifying such Extension Excluded Party in accordance with Section&nbsp;5.03(b),
MergerSub shall extend the Offer until the first Business Day following the Cut-off Date, (v)&nbsp;if on
the initial Expiration Date of the Offer or on any subsequent scheduled Expiration Date of the
Offer, all Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived, MergerSub may, from time to
time, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer for one or more periods of not more than five (5)
Business Days each beyond such Expiration Date, provided, however, that MergerSub shall not be
entitled to extend the Offer to any date occurring after the Termination Date, (w)&nbsp;MergerSub shall
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC or the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer, (x)&nbsp;MergerSub shall extend the Offer
for one or more periods of no more than five (5)&nbsp;Business Days each (or such longer period as the
parties hereto agree) until the condition set forth in clause (ii)&nbsp;of the first paragraph
of Annex I related to the HSR Act and Foreign Antitrust Laws is satisfied or waived; provided,

Termination Date or (2)&nbsp;at any time that Parent or MergerSub is permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Article&nbsp;VIII, (y)&nbsp;if on any scheduled Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition

(20)&nbsp;Business Days to meet the objective that there be validly tendered, in accordance with the
terms of the Offer, prior to the Expiration Date and not validly withdrawn, a number of shares of

Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, represent at least 90% of the then outstanding shares of

pursuant to the Offer promptly (within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange
Act) after expiration of the Offer (subject to the provisions of Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under the Exchange
Act, to the extent applicable). The Offer Price shall be net to the seller in cash, without
interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. Acceptance for payment of the
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer after the
expiration of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the &#147;<U>Offer Closing</U>&#148;, and the
date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the &#147;<U>Offer Closing
Date</U>&#148;. If the payment of the Offer Price is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the tendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x)&nbsp;the
Certificate so tendered be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and
(y)&nbsp;the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Offer Price to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate tendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting
Person, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and MergerSub that such Tax either
has been paid or is not required to be paid.

irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, and MergerSub shall not in the event of any
