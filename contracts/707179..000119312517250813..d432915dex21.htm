AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated to be effective
as of the 7th day of August, 2017, by and between OLD NATIONAL BANCORP, an
Indiana corporation ("ONB"), and ANCHOR BANCORP, INC., a Minnesota corporation
("Anchor").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, ONB is an Indiana corporation registered as a financial holding
company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the
"BHC Act"), with its principal office located in Evansville, Vanderburgh
County, Indiana; and

 

WHEREAS, Anchor is a Minnesota corporation registered as a bank holding
company under the BHC Act, with its principal office located in St. Louis
Park, Hennepin County, Minnesota; and

WHEREAS, ONB and Anchor seek to affiliate through a corporate reorganization
whereby Anchor will merge with and into ONB, and thereafter, Anchor Bank,
National Association ("Bank"), a national banking association and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Anchor, will be merged with and into Old National Bank, a
national banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary of ONB; and

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of the parties hereto have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective corporations and their
respective shareholders to consummate the merger provided for herein and have
approved this Agreement, authorized its execution and designated this
Agreement a plan of reorganization and a plan of merger; and

WHEREAS, certain shareholders have each agreed to execute and deliver to ONB
voting agreements substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _
5.17_.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises,
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby make this Agreement and
prescribe the terms and conditions of the merger of Anchor with and into ONB,
and the mode of carrying such merger into effect as follows:

ARTICLE I.

 

THE MERGER

 

1.01 _The Merger_.

 

(a) _General Description_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Article IX hereof),
Anchor shall merge with and into and under the Articles of Incorporation of
ONB (the "Merger"). ONB shall survive the  Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation")
and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Indiana pursuant to the provisions of and with the effect provided in the
Indiana Business Corporation Law, as amended.

(b) _Name, Officers and Directors_. The name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be "Old National Bancorp." Its principal office shall be located at One
Main Street, Evansville, Vanderburgh County, Indiana. The officers of ONB
serving at the Effective Time shall continue to serve as the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until such time as their successors shall have been
duly elected and have qualified or until their earlier resignation, death or
removal from office. The directors of the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time shall be those individuals serving as directors of ONB at the
Effective Time until such time as their successors have been duly elected and
have qualified or until their earlier resignation, death or removal as a
director.

(c) _Articles of Incorporation and  By-Laws_. The Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws of ONB in existence at the Effective Time shall
remain the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time, until such Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws
shall be further amended as provided by applicable law. 

(d) _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the title to all
assets, real estate and other property owned by Anchor shall vest in
Surviving Corporation as set forth in Indiana Code Section 23-1-40-6, as
amended, without reversion or impairment. At the Effective Time, all
liabilities of Anchor shall be assumed by Surviving Corporation as set forth
in Indiana Code Section 23-1-40-6, as amended.

 

(e) _Integration_. At the Effective Time and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto currently intend to
effectuate, or cause to be effectuated, the Merger, pursuant to Articles of
Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _
1.01(e)(i)_, and a Plan of Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit_ __ _ 1.01(e)(ii)_. The parties agree to cooperate and to take
all reasonable actions prior to or following the Effective Time, including
executing all requisite documentation, as may be reasonably necessary to
effect the Merger.

1.02 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_ _._ At ONBs election,
the Merger may alternatively be structured so that (a) Anchor is merged with
and into any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ONB or (b)
any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ONB is merged with and into
Anchor; provided, however, that no such change shall (x) alter or change the
amount or kind of the Merger Consideration (as hereinafter defined) or the
treatment of the holders of common stock, $0.10 par value per share, of
Anchor ("Anchor Common Stock") or options to purchase Anchor Common Stock,
(y) prevent the parties from obtaining the opinions of counsel referred to in
Sections 7.01(i) and 7.02(h) or otherwise cause the transaction to fail to
qualify for the tax treatment described in Section 1.03, or (z) materially
impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event of such an election, the parties agree to execute an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent such amendment only
changes the method of effecting the business combination and does not
substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the
parties or their respective shareholders) in order to reflect such election.

 



2 1.03 _Tax Free Reorganization_. ONB and Anchor intend for the Merger to
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related
sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
that this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code, and agree to cooperate and to take such
actions as may be reasonably necessary to assure such result.

 

1.04 _Absence of Control_. Subject to any specific provisions of the
Agreement, it is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that neither ONB
nor Anchor by reason of this Agreement shall be deemed (until consummation of
the transactions contemplated here) to control, directly or indirectly, the
other party or any of its respective Subsidiaries (as such term is defined
below) and shall not exercise or be deemed to exercise, directly or
indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of such
other party or any of its respective Subsidiaries.

 

1.05 _Bank Merger_. Anchor and ONB agree to take all action necessary and
appropriate, including entering into a plan of merger (the "Bank Merger
Agreement") substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.05_ , to
cause Bank to merge with and into Old National Bank (the "Bank Merger") in
accordance with the applicable laws and regulations effective simultaneous
with the consummation of the Merger. At the effective time of the Bank Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Bank will terminate. Old National Bank
will be the surviving bank and will continue its corporate existence under
applicable law. The articles of association of Old National Bank, as then in
effect, will be the articles of association of the surviving bank, and the By-
Laws of Old National Bank, as then in effect, will be the By-Laws of the
surviving bank.

 

1.06 _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. The holders of Anchor Common Stock, Voting
Preferred Stock and Class A1 Preferred Stock ("Anchor Stock") are entitled to
dissenters rights under Section 302A.471 of the Minnesota Business
Corporation Act, as amended ("MBCA").

 

ARTICLE II.

MANNER AND BASIS OF EXCHANGE OF STOCK

2.01 _Consideration_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time:

(a) _Anchor Common Stock_. Each share of Anchor Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares
held as treasury stock of Anchor, (ii) shares held directly or indirectly by
ONB, except shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of a debt
previously contracted, if any, and (iii) Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter
defined)) shall become and be converted into the right to receive in
accordance with this Article, (1) 1.350 shares of common stock (the "Common
Stock Exchange Ratio") (as adjusted in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement), without par value, of ONB ("ONB Common Stock"), and (2) cash
consideration in the amount of $2.625 per share (the "Common Stock Cash
Consideration").

 



3 (b) _Stock Options_. Each option to purchase Anchor Common Stock granted
under the Anchor Bancorp, Inc. 1996 Stock Option Plan or Anchor Bancorp, Inc.
2013 Stock Option Plan (each an "Anchor Stock Option Plan" and collectively,
the "Anchor Stock Option Plans"), as applicable (each an "Anchor Stock
Option", and collectively, the "Anchor Stock Options"), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right
at the Effective Time to receive an amount, equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of Anchor Common Stock subject to such Anchor Stock
Option and (ii) the positive difference, if any, of (A) the Common Stock Cash
Consideration on a per share basis plus the Common Stock Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the Average ONB Closing Price (as hereinafter defined) less (B)
the exercise price of such Anchor Stock Option, subject to any consents
required from holders of Anchor Stock Options or necessary amendments to the
applicable Anchor Stock Option Plan or award agreements (the "Options
Settlement Amount"). ONB shall pay the Options Settlement Amount in shares of
ONB Common Stock valued at the Average ONB Closing Price. ONB shall pay the
Anchor Stock Option holders the Options Settlement Amount described in this
Section 2.01(b), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law with
respect to the making of such payment, on or as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of Closing, but in any event within five (5) business days
following the date of Closing.

 

(c) _Merger Consideration_. The total stock and cash consideration to be
paid by ONB in respect of shares of Anchor Common Stock and Anchor Stock
Options is referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration."

 

(d) _Dissenters Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, if required by the MBCA (but only to the extent required
thereby), Anchor Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Anchor Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.03(i)) and that is held by holders of such Anchor Stock who have not voted
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and
who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in
accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 302A.473 of the
MBCA (the "Dissenting Shares") will not be convertible into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will
be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 302A.473 unless and until any
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to
appraisal and payment under the MBCA. If, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such
Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into
and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and ONB shall remain
liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such shares of Anchor
Stock. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section
302A.471 of the MCBA and as provided in the previous sentence. Anchor will
give ONB (i) notice of any demands received by Anchor for appraisals of shares
of Anchor Stock and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. Anchor
shall not, except with the prior written consent of ONB, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or settle any such demands.

 



4 2.02 _Adjustment to Exchange Ratio_. At the Effective Time, the Common
Stock Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted, if applicable (which Common Stock
Exchange Ratio, as adjusted as provided below and in Section 2.04, shall
become the "Common Stock Exchange Ratio" for purposes of this Agreement)
in accordance with this Section 2.02. If the Anchor Consolidated
Shareholders Equity as of the end of the month prior to the Effective Time
(the "Computation Date") is less than One Hundred Seventy-Nine Million
Dollars ($179,000,000), the Common Stock Exchange Ratio shall be decreased to
a quotient determined by dividing the Adjusted Stock Purchase Price by the
total number of shares of Anchor Common Stock outstanding at the Effective
Time, and further dividing that number by the Average ONB Closing Price.

As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated below: 

" _Adjusted Stock Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to (x) the Purchase Price
less (y) the difference between $179,000,000 and the Anchor Consolidated
Shareholders Equity as of the end of the month prior to the Effective Time.

 

" _Anchor Consolidated Shareholders  Equity_" shall be the consolidated

added the following amounts (which amounts shall also be calculated in

per share closing prices of a share of ONB Common Stock as quoted on the
NASDAQ Global Market during the ten (10) trading days preceding the fifth
(5th) calendar day preceding the Effective Time.

 

" _Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to the Average ONB Closing Price
multiplied by the total number of shares of ONB Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to Section 2.01 as though the Common Stock Exchange Ratio was not

(a) At and after the Effective Time, each share of Anchor Common Stock
shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, ONB shall reserve a sufficient
number of shares of ONB Common Stock to be issued as part of the Merger
Consideration. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event more than five (5) business days thereafter, ONB shall mail to each
holder of record of Anchor Common Stock a letter of transmittal with a form
providing instructions and requesting usual and customary information (the
"Exchange Form") necessary to effect the issuance of shares of ONB Common
Stock in exchange for shares of Anchor Common Stock pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 



5 (c) ONB shall cause a statement of ownership of book-entry
shares representing that number of shares of ONB Common Stock (including
fractional shares) that each holder of Anchor Common Stock has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.01 and a check in the amount of any cash
consideration and dividends or distributions which such holder shall be
entitled to receive, to be delivered to such shareholder upon receipt by ONB
of a properly completed and executed Exchange Form. An Exchange Form will be
deemed received by ONB only if ONB shall have received a fully and properly
completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials included
in the Exchange Form) Exchange Form. No interest will be paid on any Merger
Consideration that any such holder shall be entitled to receive pursuant
to this Article II upon such delivery.

(d) No dividends or other distributions on ONB Common Stock with a
record date occurring after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any shares of Anchor Common Stock converted in the Merger into the right to
receive shares of such ONB Common Stock unless and until ONB receives the
Exchange Form in accordance with this Section 2.03. After becoming so
entitled in accordance with this Section 2.03, the record holder thereof also
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of ONB Common Stock such holder had the right to receive
upon receipt by ONB of the Exchange Form.

 

(e) ONB shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the applicable Merger

Section 2.03 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Anchor Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by ONB and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Anchor Common Stock in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by ONB. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Governmental Authority" shall mean any government (or any
political subdivision or jurisdiction thereof), court, bureau, agency or
other governmental entity having or asserting jurisdiction over the applicable
party or its business, operations or properties.

 

(f) The stock transfer books of Anchor shall be closed immediately upon the

transfers on the stock transfer records of Anchor of any shares of Anchor
Common Stock.

 

(g) ONB shall be entitled to rely upon Anchors stock transfer books to
establish the identity of those individuals, partnerships, corporations,
trusts, joint ventures, organizations or other entities (each, a "Person")
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
any Anchor Common Stock, ONB shall be entitled to deposit any Merger
Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party
and thereafter be relieved from any and all liability with respect to any
claims thereto.

 



6 (h) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Exchange Form, ONB,
in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, shall have the
right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing (i) the validity of all Exchange Forms and compliance by
any holder of Anchor Common Stock with the exchange procedures set forth
herein, (ii) the method of issuance and delivery of a statement of ownership
of book-entry shares representing the number of shares of ONB Common Stock
into which shares of Anchor Common Stock are converted in the Merger, and
(iii) the method of payment of Common Stock Cash Consideration.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Anchor Common Stock that are held as treasury
stock of Anchor or owned by ONB (other than shares held in a fiduciary
capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Anchor or
other consideration shall be exchanged therefor.

(j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto shall be liable to any
former holder of Anchor Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

 

2.04 _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. If ONB changes (or establishes a record
date for changing) the number of shares of ONB Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time by way of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding ONB Common Stock, and the record date therefor shall be prior to
the Effective Time, the Common Stock Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted so the
shareholders of Anchor at the Effective Time shall receive, in the aggregate,
such number of shares of ONB Common Stock representing the same percentage
of outstanding shares of ONB Common Stock as would have been represented by
the number of shares of ONB Common Stock the shareholders of Anchor would have
received if any of the foregoing actions had not occurred. No adjustment shall
be made under this Section 2.04 solely as a result of ONB issuing additional
shares of ONB Common Stock provided it receives fair market value
consideration for such shares or such shares are issued in connection with the
ONB Plans (as hereinafter defined).

that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business, other than those of general application that apply to similarly
situated bank holding companies or their subsidiaries, whether or not set
forth in the Anchor Disclosure Schedule (a "Anchor Regulatory Agreement"), nor
has Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary been advised since January 1, 2013, by
any regulatory agency or other governmental entity that it is considering
issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any such Anchor Regulatory
Agreement. There are no refunds or restitutions required to be paid as a
result of any criticism of any regulatory agency or body cited in any
examination report of Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary as a result of an
examination by any regulatory agency or body, or set forth in
any accountants or auditors report to Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 3.28 or this Agreement
shall require Anchor to provide ONB with any confidential regulatory
supervisory information of Anchor or Bank.

3.29 _Internal Controls_ _._

 

(a) None of Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiaries records, systems, controls,
data or information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise
wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic,
mechanical or photographic process, whether

 



25  computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or
Anchor Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a materially adverse effect
on the system of internal accounting controls described in the next sentence.
Anchor and Anchor Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

 

(b) Bank (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (consistent with the requirements of 12 C.F.R. Part 363) to ensure
that material information relating to Bank, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Bank and Anchor by others
within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Anchors outside auditors and the
audit committee of Anchors Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Banks or Anchors ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Banks
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to Banks auditors and audit committee and a copy has
previously been made available to ONB.

(c) Since December 31, 2015, (i) through the date hereof, neither Anchor
nor any Anchor Subsidiary has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge
of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii)
no attorney representing Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary, whether or not
employed by Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Anchor
or of any Anchor Subsidiary or any committee thereof or to any director or
officer of Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary.

 

3.30 _Fiduciary Accounts_. Anchor and each Anchor Subsidiary has properly
administered in all material respects all accounts for which it acts as a
fiduciary, including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents
and applicable laws and regulations. Neither Anchor nor any Anchor Subsidiary,
nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees, has committed
any breach of trust to Anchors knowledge with respect to any fiduciary
account and the records for each such fiduciary account are true and correct
and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

 

3.31 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Board of Directors of Anchor, at
a duly constituted and held meeting at which a quorum was present throughout,
has been informed orally by Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P. ("Sandler
ONeill"), that the Merger Consideration, as of the date of this Agreement, is
fair to the shareholders of Anchor from a financial point of view. Such
opinion has not been amended or rescinded in any material respect.

 



26 ARTICLE IV.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ONB

 

On or prior to the date hereof, ONB has delivered to Anchor a schedule (the
"ONB Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
this Article IV or to one or more of its covenants contained in Article VI.

For the purpose of this Agreement, and in relation to ONB and ONB
Subsidiaries (as such term is defined below), a "Material Adverse Effect on
ONB" means any effect that (i) is material and adverse to the results of
operations, properties, assets, liabilities, condition (financial
or otherwise), value or business of ONB and ONB Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, or (ii) would materially impair the ability of ONB to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially threaten or
materially impede the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that a Material Adverse
Effect on ONB shall not be deemed to include the impact of (a) changes in
banking and similar laws of general applicability to banks or savings
associations or their holding companies or interpretations thereof by courts
or governmental authorities, (b) changes in GAAP or regulatory accounting
requirements applicable to banks, savings associations, or their holding
companies generally, (c) the impact of the announcement of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, and compliance with this Agreement on
the business, financial condition or results of operations of ONB and
ONB Subsidiaries, (d) changes resulting from expenses (such as legal,
accounting and investment bankers fees) incurred in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, and (e) the occurrence of
any military or terrorist attack within the United States or any of its
possessions or offices; provided that in no event shall a change in the
trading price of the shares of ONB Common Stock, by itself, be considered to
constitute a Material Adverse Effect on ONB and ONB Subsidiaries taken as a
whole (it being understood that the foregoing proviso shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any effect underlying such decline has
resulted in a Material Adverse Effect on ONB).

 

For the purpose of this Agreement, and in relation to ONB, "knowledge" means
those facts that are known or should have been known after due inquiry by the
directors and executive officers of ONB and its Subsidiaries. Additionally,
for the purpose of this Agreement, and in relation to ONB, "ONB Subsidiary" or
collectively, "ONB Subsidiaries" shall mean any entity or entities required
to be consolidated with ONB for financial reporting purposes pursuant to GAAP.

 



27 Accordingly, ONB represents and warrants to Anchor as follows, except as set
forth in the ONB Disclosure Schedule:

in the manner and by the means utilized as of the date hereof. ONB has

valid and enforceable lease or contract all other properties and assets

respective business and which are in either case material to its respective
business; good and marketable title to, or right to use by terms of a valid

any local municipality, sewage district or other governmental entity against

knowledge there is no reasonable basis or grounds for any such claim, action
or proceeding. No environmental clearances are required for the conduct of the
business of ONB or any ONB Subsidiary as currently conducted or the

32  ONB Subsidiary is the owner, operator or lessee, of any property on which
any substances have been used, stored, deposited, treated, recycled or
disposed of, which substances if known to be present on, at or under such
property would require clean-up, removal, treatment, abatement, response
costs, or any other remedial action under any Environmental Law. To ONBs

clean-up or remediation under any of the Environmental Laws with respect to

stock, performance share, phantom stock or incentive plans or arrangements,
or other employee benefit or fringe benefit programs for the benefit of former
or current employees or directors of ONB or ONB Subsidiaries (collectively,
"ONB Plans"), all such ONB Plans have, on a continuous basis since their

(c) There are no pending or, to ONBs knowledge, threatened material labor
grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against ONB or
any ONB Subsidiary, or any strikes or other labor disputes against ONB or any

any collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor organization,
or work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization or employee
association applicable to employees of ONB or any ONB Subsidiary and, to the
knowledge of ONB, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group
seeking to represent any employees of ONB or any ONB Subsidiary.

established, and shall establish in the Subsequent ONB Financial Statements
(as hereinafter defined), in accordance with GAAP, a reserve for taxes in the
Subsequent ONB Financial Statements adequate to cover all of ONBs and ONB
Subsidiaries tax liabilities (including, without limitation, income taxes,
payroll taxes and withholding, and franchise fees) for the periods
then ending. Neither ONB nor any ONB

 



33  Subsidiary has, nor will any of them have, any liability for material taxes
of any nature for or with respect to the operation of its business, from the
date hereof up to and including the Effective Time, except to the extent set
forth in the Subsequent ONB Financial Statements (as hereinafter defined) or
as accrued or reserved for on the books and records of ONB or ONB

full force and effect and all premiums due thereon have been paid when due.

4.14 _Books and Records_. The books and records of ONB are, in all
material respects, complete, correct and accurately reflect the basis for the
financial condition, results of operations, business, assets and capital of
ONB on a consolidated basis set forth in the ONB Financial Statements.

National Bank has been advised of any supervisory criticisms regarding their
compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (41 USC 5422, et seq.) or related state
or federal anti-money laundering laws, regulations and guidelines, including
without limitation those provisions of federal regulations requiring (i) the
filing of reports, such as Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious
Activity Reports, (ii) the maintenance of records and (iii) the exercise of
due diligence in identifying customers. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 4.18 or this Agreement shall require ONB to provide
Anchor with any confidential regulatory supervisory information of ONB or Old
National Bank.

 

4.19 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Since January 1, 2014, neither
ONB nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist, consent
order or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any
written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or
is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject
to any order or directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil money
penalty by, or has been since January 1, 2014 a recipient of any supervisory
letter from, or since January 1, 2014, has adopted any policies, procedures or
board resolutions at the request or suggestion of any regulatory agency or
other governmental entity that currently restricts in any material respect
the conduct of its business or that in any material manner relates to its
capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk management
policies, its management or its business, other than those of general
application that apply to similarly situated bank holding companies or their
subsidiaries, whether or not set forth in the ONB Disclosure Schedule (an "ONB
Regulatory Agreement"), nor has ONB or any of its Subsidiaries been advised
since January 1, 2014, by any regulatory agency or other governmental entity
that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any such
ONB Regulatory Agreement. There are no refunds or restitutions required to be
paid as a result of any criticism of any regulatory agency or body cited in
any examination report of ONB or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of an
examination by any regulatory agency or body, or set forth in any accountants
or auditors report to ONB or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 4.19 or this Agreement shall require ONB to
provide Anchor with any confidential regulatory supervisory information of ONB
or Old National Bank.

 

4.20 _Internal Controls_.

 

(a) None of ONB or its Subsidiaries records, systems, controls, data or
information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or
partly dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic, mechanical
or photographic process, whether computerized or not) which (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of it or its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls
described in the next sentence. ONB and its Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP.

 



35 (b) ONB (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to ONB including its Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of ONB
by others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to ONBs outside auditors and the
audit committee of ONBs Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect ONBs ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in ONBs internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing by management to ONBs auditors and audit committee and a
copy has previously been made available to Anchor. As of the date hereof,
there is no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

(c) Since December 31, 2016, (i) through the date hereof, neither ONB nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of ONB or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that ONB or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing ONB or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by ONB or
any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by ONB or any
of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of
ONB or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of ONB.

(b) On and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time or
until this Agreement is terminated as herein provided, each of Anchor and
each Anchor Subsidiary shall: (i) carry on its business diligently,
substantially in the manner as is presently being conducted and in the
ordinary course of business; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve its business organization intact, keep available the services of the
present officers and employees and preserve its present relationships with
customers and Persons having business dealings with it; (iii) use

date of this Agreement.

5.05 _Accruals for Loan Loss Reserve and Expenses_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Anchor shall and shall cause Anchor
Subsidiaries to make, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the
SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, such appropriate accounting
entries in its books and records and use commercially reasonable efforts to
take such other actions as Anchor and Anchor Subsidiaries shall deem to be
necessary or desirable in anticipation of the Merger including, without
limitation, accruals or the creation of reserves for employee benefits and
Merger-related expenses.

 

(b) Anchor recognizes that ONB may have adopted different loan and
accounting policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels
of loan loss allowances). Subject to applicable law (including without
limitation applicable banking laws and regulations and GAAP) and the
conditions in Section 5.05(d), from and after the date hereof Anchor shall
consult and cooperate in good faith with ONB with respect to conforming the
loan and accounting policies and practices of Anchor to those policies and
practices of ONB for financial accounting and/or income tax reporting
purposes, as reasonably specified in each case in writing from ONB to Anchor,
based upon such consultation.

(c) Subject to applicable law (including without limitation applicable
banking laws and regulations and GAAP) and the conditions in Section 5.05(d),
Anchor shall consult and cooperate in good faith with ONB with respect to
determining, as reasonably specified in a written notice from ONB to Anchor,
based upon such consultation, the amount and the timing for recognizing for
financial accounting and/or income tax reporting purposes of Anchors expenses
of the Merger.

 

(d) Subject to applicable law (including without limitation applicable
banking laws and regulations and GAAP), Anchor shall consult and cooperate in
good faith to (i) make such conforming entries to conform the loan and
accounting policies and practices of Anchor to the policies and practices of
ONB as contemplated in Section 5.05(b) above and (ii) recognize Anchors
expenses of the Merger for financial accounting and/or income tax reporting
purposes at such times as are reasonably requested in writing by ONB as
contemplated in Section 5.05(c) above, but in no event prior to the fifth
(5th) day next preceding the Closing Date and only after

 



41  ONB acknowledges that all conditions to its obligation to consummate the
Merger have been satisfied and certifies to Anchor that ONB will at the
Effective Time deliver to Anchor the certificate contemplated in Section
7.02(g).

(e) Anchors representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect for any
purpose as a consequence of any modifications or changes undertaken on account
of Section 5.05(d).

 

5.06 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Anchor will, and will cause each Anchor Subsidiary, and its and their
respective officers, directors and representatives (including Sandler
ONeill) to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person that has made or
indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal (as defined below).
During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
Anchor shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any material provision of
any confidentiality or similar agreement to which Anchor or any
Anchor Subsidiary is a party (other than any involving ONB).

(b) Except as permitted in this Section 5.06, Anchor shall not, and shall
cause each Anchor Subsidiary, and its and their respective directors, officers
and representatives (including Sandler ONeill) not to, (i) solicit, initiate
or knowingly encourage or facilitate, or take any other action designed to,
or that could reasonably be expected to, facilitate (including by way of
furnishing non-public information) any inquiries with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) initiate, participate in or knowingly encourage
any discussions or negotiations or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way
with any Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that, at
any time prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger by Anchors
shareholders, if Anchor receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the
Anchor Board of Directors determines in good faith constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) that
was not solicited after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a
breach of Anchors obligations under this Section 5.06, Anchor may furnish, or
cause to be furnished, non-public information with respect to Anchor and
Anchor Subsidiaries to the Person who made such proposal (provided that all
such information has been provided to ONB prior to or at the same time it is
provided to such Person) and may participate in discussions and negotiations
regarding such proposal if (A) the Anchor Board of Directors determines in
good faith, and following consultation with financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in
a breach of its fiduciary duties to Anchors shareholders under applicable
law and (B) prior to taking such action, Anchor has used its best reasonable
efforts to enter into a confidentiality agreement with respect to such
proposal that contains a standstill agreement on customary terms. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
contained in the first sentence of this Section 5.06 by any representative
(including Sandler ONeill) of Anchor or Anchor Subsidiaries shall be a
breach of this Section 5.06 by Anchor.

(c) Neither the Anchor Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall
(or shall agree or resolve to) (i) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to ONB or propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
ONB (or take any action inconsistent with) the recommendation by such Anchor
Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or

 



42  the Merger, or approve or recommend, or propose to recommend, the approval
or recommendation of any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing being
referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (ii) cause or
permit Anchor or Bank to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other agreement with a third party (each, an "Acquisition Agreement")
constituting or related to, or which is intended to or would be reasonably
likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 5.06(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to the special meeting of Anchors shareholders to approve the
Merger, the Anchor Board of Directors may, in response to a
Superior Proposal, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into an
Acquisition Agreement, provided, that the Anchor Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Anchor under applicable
Law, and provided, further, that the Anchor Board of Directors may not effect
such an Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into an Acquisition Agreement
unless (A) the Anchor Board shall have first provided prior written notice to
ONB that it is prepared to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or enter
into an Acquisition Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, which
notice shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal, attach the most current
version of any proposed written agreement or letter of intent relating to the
transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal (it being understood that
any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new five (5) business day
period) and (B) ONB does not make, within five (5) business days after
receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith
judgment of the Anchor Board of Directors (after consultation with financial
advisors and outside legal counsel), cause the offer previously constituting a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or that the
Adverse Recommendation Change or execution of an Acquisition Agreement is no
longer required to comply with the Anchor Boards fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of Anchor under applicable law. Anchor agrees that, during the
five (5) business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation
Change or execution of an Acquisition Agreement, Anchor and its officers,
directors and representatives shall negotiate in good faith with ONB and its
officers, directors and representatives regarding any revisions to the terms
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by ONB.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of Anchor set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 5.06, Anchor shall as promptly as possible, and in
any event within two (2) business days after Anchor first obtains knowledge of
the receipt thereof, advise ONB orally and in writing of (i) any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for information that Anchor reasonably believes could
lead to or contemplates an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any inquiry Anchor
reasonably believes could lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including any
subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions) and
the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or request or
inquiry. In connection with any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, if there occurs or is presented to Anchor any offer, material change,
modification or development to a previously made offer, letter of intent or
any other material development, Anchor (or its outside counsel) shall (A)
advise and confer with ONB (or its outside counsel) regarding the progress of
negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal, the

 



43  material resolved and unresolved issues related thereto and the material
terms (including material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and
other material terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry,
and (B) promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof provide ONB with true,
correct and complete copies of any document or communication related thereto.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean (i)
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons (other
than as contemplated by this Agreement) relating to, or that could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, of (A) assets or businesses that
constitute 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets of Anchor and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of Anchor or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially
owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Anchor or any Anchor
Subsidiary; (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share
exchange or similar transaction involving Anchor, Bank or any other Anchor
Subsidiary pursuant to which any Person or the shareholders of any Person
would own 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Anchor, Bank, or
any other Anchor Subsidiary or of any resulting parent company of Anchor or
Bank; or (iv) any other transaction the consummation of which could reasonably
be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay the Merger
or that could reasonably be expected to dilute materially the benefits to ONB
of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the transactions
contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Section 5.06, a "Person" shall
include a natural Person, or any legal, commercial or Governmental Authority,
including, a corporation, general partnership, joint venture, limited
partnership, limited liability company, trust, business association, group
acting in concert or any Person acting in a representative capacity.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any
Acquisition Proposal (but changing the references to "20% or more" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "50% or more") that the Anchor Board
determines in good faith (after having received the advice of its financial
advisors), to be (i) more favorable to the shareholders of Anchor from a
financial point of view than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement [including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation and any
changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by ONB in response
to such offer or otherwise]) and (ii) reasonably capable of being completed
without undue delay taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal.

 

5.07 _Press Releases_. Unless prior notice and comment is not possible or
practicable as the result of applicable law or any listing or exchange rule,
neither Anchor nor ONB will issue any press or news releases or make any other
public announcements or disclosures relating to the Merger without providing a
final copy of such press or news release to the other party and providing
such party with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press or news
release.

 



44 5.08 _Material Changes to Disclosure Schedules_. Anchor shall promptly
supplement, amend and update, upon the occurrence of any change prior to the
Effective Time, and as of the Effective Time, the Anchor Disclosure Schedule
with respect to any matters or events hereafter arising which, if in existence
or having occurred as of the date of this Agreement, would have been required
to be set forth or described in the Anchor Disclosure Schedule or this
Agreement and including, without limitation, any fact which, if existing or
known as of the date hereof, would have made any of the representations or
warranties of Anchor contained herein materially incorrect, untrue or
misleading. No such supplement, amendment or update shall become part of the
Anchor Disclosure Schedule unless ONB shall have first consented in writing
with respect thereto.

5.09 _Access; Information_. ONB and Anchor, and their representatives and
agents, shall, upon reasonable notice to the other party, at all times during
normal business hours prior to the Effective Time, have full and continuing
access to the properties, facilities, operations, books and records of
the other party. ONB and Anchor, and their representatives and agents may,
prior to the Effective Time, make or cause to be made such reasonable
investigation of the operations, books, records and properties of the other
party and their respective Subsidiaries and of their financial and legal
condition as deemed necessary or advisable to familiarize themselves with such
operations, books, records, properties and other matters; provided, however,
that such access or investigation shall not interfere unnecessarily with the
normal business operations of Anchor or ONB or their respective Subsidiaries.
Upon request, Anchor and ONB will furnish the other party or its
representatives or agents, their attorneys responses to external auditors
requests for information, management letters received from their external
auditors and such financial, loan and operating data and other information
reasonably requested by ONB or Anchor which has been or is developed by the
other party, its auditors, accountants or attorneys (provided with respect to
attorneys, such disclosure would not result in the waiver by the other party
of any claim of attorney-client privilege), and will permit ONB or Anchor or
their representatives or agents to discuss such information directly with any
individual or firm performing auditing or accounting functions for Anchor or
ONB, as applicable, and such auditors and accountants will be directed to
furnish copies of any reports or financial information as developed to ONB or
Anchor or its representatives or agents, as applicable. No investigation by
ONB or Anchor shall affect the representations and warranties made by Anchor
or ONB herein. Any confidential information or trade secrets received by ONB,
Anchor or their representatives or agents in the course of such examination
will be treated confidentially, and any correspondence, memoranda, records,
copies, documents and electronic or other media of any kind containing
such confidential information or trade secrets or both shall be destroyed by
ONB or Anchor, as applicable, or at ONBs or Anchors request, returned to ONB
or Anchor, as applicable, in the event this Agreement is terminated as

Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement, and any real property acquired
or leased by Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement.
If any phase one report discloses any adverse environmental conditions, or
reports a reasonable suspicion thereof, on any such real estate, and if

practicable the written fairness opinion from Sandler ONeill, to the effect

6.01 _Other Approvals_. ONB shall have primary responsibility for the
preparation, filing and costs of all bank regulatory applications require for
consummation of the Merger, and shall file such applications as promptly as
practicable, and in the most expeditious manner practicable, and in any event,
within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement. ONB shall
provide to Anchors counsel copies of all applications filed and copies of all
material written communications with all state and federal bank regulatory
agencies relating to such applications. ONB shall proceed expeditiously,
cooperate fully and use its best efforts to procure, upon terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to ONB, all consents, authorizations, approvals,
registrations and certificates, to complete all filings and applications and
to satisfy all other requirements prescribed by law which are necessary for
consummation of the Merger on the terms and conditions provided in this
Agreement at the earliest possible reasonable date.

 

6.02 _SEC Registration_.

 

(a) ONB shall file with the SEC as promptly as practicable and in the most
expeditious manner practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days
after the execution of this Agreement, a Registration Statement on an
appropriate form under the 1933 Act covering the shares of ONB Common Stock to
be issued pursuant to this Agreement and shall use its best reasonable
efforts to cause the same to become effective and thereafter, until the
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement, to keep the same effective
and, if necessary, amend and supplement the same. Such Registration Statement
and any amendments and supplements thereto are referred to in this Agreement
as the "Registration Statement." The Registration Statement, if appropriate,
shall include a proxy statement-prospectus reasonably acceptable to ONB and
Anchor, prepared for use in connection with the meeting of shareholders of
Anchor referred to in Section 5.01 hereof, all in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the SEC. ONB shall, as soon as practicable after filing the
Registration Statement, make all filings required to obtain all blue sky
exemptions, authorizations, consents or approvals required for the issuance of
ONB Common Stock.

 

(b) Any materials or information provided by ONB for use in any filing with
any state or federal regulatory agency or authority shall not contain any
untrue or misleading statement of material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not false or misleading.

 

(c) ONB will use reasonable best efforts to list for trading on NASDAQ
Global Market (subject to official notice of issuance) prior to the Effective
Time, the shares of ONB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

 



50 6.03 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) ONB shall make available to the officers and employees of Anchor or any
Anchor Subsidiary who have met all eligibility requirements of Anchors or an
Anchor Subsidiarys plans and who continue as employees of Anchor, any Anchor
Subsidiary, ONB or any ONB Subsidiary after the Effective Time ("Continuing
Employees"), substantially the same employee benefits on substantially the
same terms and conditions as ONB offers to similarly situated officers and
employees. For any Anchor employees who have not become eligible for Anchors
or an Anchor Subsidiarys plans, such employees will be subject to the same
or substantially similar waiting periods to participate as Continuing
Employees in the ongoing benefit plans. Continuing Employees will receive
credit for prior service with Anchor, Voyager Bank, Anchor Subsidiaries or
their predecessors, for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the employee
benefit plans of ONB and ONB Subsidiaries. To the extent that ONB determines,
in its sole discretion, that Anchors employee benefit plans should
be terminated, Continuing Employees eligible for participation in Anchors
terminated employee benefits plans, shall become eligible to participate in
ONBs employee benefit plans as soon as reasonably practicable after
termination. Continuing Employees who become covered under the health or
dental plans of ONB shall not be subject to any waiting periods or additional
pre-existing condition limitations under the health and dental plans of ONB
or ONB Subsidiaries in which they are eligible to participate than they
otherwise would have been subject to under the health and dental plans of
Anchor. To the extent that the initial period of coverage for Continuing
Employees under any such ONB employee benefit plans is not a full 12-month
period of coverage, Continuing Employees shall be given credit under the
applicable plan for any deductibles and co-insurance payments made by such
Continuing Employees under the corresponding Anchor plan during the balance of
such 12-month period of coverage provided that ONB can obtain, in a manner
satisfactory to ONB, as determined in its sole discretion, the necessary data.
After the Effective Time, ONB shall continue to maintain all fully insured
employee welfare benefit, and cafeteria, plans currently in effect at
the Effective Time, until such time as ONB determines, in its sole
discretion, to modify or terminate any or all of those plans. Claims incurred
under the employee welfare benefit and cafeteria plans prior to plan
termination shall be paid in accordance with the applicable plans claim
submission procedures and deadlines.

(b) As of the Effective Time, subject to applicable law and the
requirements of the Old National Bancorp Employee Stock Ownership and Savings
Plan ("ONB KSOP"), ONB shall amend as necessary the ONB KSOP so that, (i) from
and after the Effective Time, Continuing Employees will accrue benefits
pursuant to the ONB KSOP, and (ii) Continuing Employees participating in the
ONB KSOP shall receive credit for eligibility and vesting purposes, for the
service of such employees with Anchor, Voyager Bank, Anchor Subsidiaries or
their predecessors prior to the Effective Time, as if such service were with
ONB or ONB Subsidiaries.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, ONB shall maintain for the benefit of
Continuing Employees vacation and sick time policies. ONB shall grant credit
for the Continuing Employees accrued and unused vacation as of the Effective
Time for the remainder of 2017, if any. Anchor shall provide any and all
information to ONB as soon as practicable following the Effective Time in a
form reasonably acceptable to ONB.

 



51 (d) After the Effective Time, mileage for Continuing Employees business-
related travel shall be reimbursed according to ONBs reimbursement policy for
mileage, consistent with the applicable provisions of the Code.

 

(e) After the Effective Time, Anchor shall not award any additional equity
grants or awards of any kind under the Anchor Stock Option Plans or any other
arrangement. Prior to the Effective Time, Anchor will use its best efforts,
including using best effort to obtain any necessary consents from optionees,
with respect to the Anchor Stock Options to permit the settlement of each
outstanding Anchor Stock Option in accordance with Section 2.01(b). Anchor
shall take action prior to the Effective Time to cause the freezing and/or
termination, as applicable, of the Anchor Stock Option immediately after the
settlement of the option, as provided in Section 2.01(b).

(f) Until the Effective Time, Anchor or an Anchor Subsidiary, whichever is
applicable, shall be liable for all obligations for continued health coverage
pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 through 609 of ERISA
("COBRA") for eligible employees who incur a qualifying event before the
Effective Time. ONB or an ONB Subsidiary, whichever is applicable, shall after
the Effective Time be liable for (i) all obligations for continued health
coverage under COBRA with respect to each qualified beneficiary of Anchor or
an Anchor Subsidiary who incurs a termination on and after the Effective Time,
and (ii) for continued health coverage under COBRA from and after the
Effective Time for each qualified beneficiary of Anchor or an Anchor
Subsidiary who incurs a qualifying event before the Effective Time.

(g) Employees of Anchor, or any Anchor Subsidiary as of the Effective Time
whom ONB or ONB Subsidiaries elect not to employ after the Effective Time or
who are terminated within twelve (12) months from the Effective Time due to
Involuntary Termination ("Separated Employees") shall be entitled to
severance benefits equal to two (2) weeks of annual base pay for each year of
service with a minimum of eight (8) weeks of annual base pay and a maximum of
fifty-two (52) weeks of annual base pay. For the purpose of this subsection,
"Involuntary Termination" means termination by (i) ONB or an ONB Subsidiary
(other than for cause) or (ii) the employee following (A) a reduction in force
or other permanent lack of work which adversely impacts the employee, as
determined by ONB or an ONB Subsidiary, (B) a reorganization or consolidation
of or within ONB or an ONB Subsidiary that eliminates the employees position
or (C) the closing or divesture of an ONB or an ONB Subsidiary facility or
business location that eliminates the employees position. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Separated Employee will not be considered to have incurred an
Involuntary Termination where he or she was offered both a reasonably
comparable position and reasonably comparable pay, as determined by ONB,
within ONB or any ONB Subsidiaries or any successor company with pay that was
to be at least one hundred percent (100%) of his or her compensation at the
time of termination and where such comparable position was within a reasonable
commuting distance of thirty-five (35) miles of the Separated Employees
primary residence. Any severance payment under this subsection will be
subject to and conditioned upon the Separated Employees execution of a
severance agreement, in a form acceptable to ONB, that includes a full release
of all federal and state law claims against Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary
and against ONB or any ONB Subsidiary arising out of the Separated Employees
employment, including any claims based on discrimination. In addition, in
order to receive any severance payments under this subsection, a Separated
Employee must work until the termination date specified by ONB or any

 



52  ONB Subsidiary. A year of service will be determined based on each Separated
Employees employment anniversary date and will include service with Anchor,
Voyager Bank, Anchor Subsidiaries and ONB or ONB Subsidiaries. Credit will be
given for partial years of service by rounding up a Separated Employee with a
fractional year of service of six (6) months of service or more to the next
full year and rounding down any Separated Employee with a fractional year of
service that is less than six (6) months of service. For example, a Separated
Employee with ten (10) years and seven (7) months of service will be credited
with eleven (11) years of service for purposes of determining his or her
severance pay. A Separated Employee with ten (10) years and four (4) months of
service will be credited with ten (10) years of service for purposes of
determining his or her severance pay. Effective as of the day following the
day which is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, all Anchor employees
who become employees of ONB will be subject to the severance policies, if any,
of ONB in effect at their time of termination without regard to this Section
6.03(g). Nothing in this Section 6.03(g) shall be deemed to limit or modify
ONBs at-will employment policy.

 

(h) As of the Effective Time, ONB shall assume the employment and change in
control agreements between Anchor and the employees listed in the Anchor
Disclosure Schedule as being party to such agreements, __ subject to mutually
satisfactory resolution of any calculated Internal Revenue Code Section 280G
excise taxes and gross-up payments that may be applicable by reason of any
such employment agreements.

 

(i) ONB shall authorize the payment of and pay retention bonuses upon
reaching certain milestones to selected employees of Anchor or Anchor
Subsidiaries as identified by ONB and Anchor, in amounts to be determined by
ONB and Anchor; provided however, the aggregate cost of the retention bonuses
shall not exceed the amount as set forth in the Anchor Disclosure Schedule.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, ONB shall have no responsibility to pay, and
Anchor shall pay, any 2017 bonuses consistent with past practice and in
amounts not to exceed the amount as set forth in the Anchor Disclosure
Schedule.

 

6.04 _Adverse Actions_. ONB shall not knowingly take any action that is
intended or is reasonably likely to result in (a) any of its representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any
respect at any time at or prior to the Effective Time, subject to the standard
set forth in Section 7.02(a), (b) any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in Article VII not being satisfied, (c) a material violation of any
provision of this Agreement or (d) a material delay in the consummation of the
Merger except, in each case, as may be required by applicable law or
regulation.

6.05 _D andO Insurance_. ONB shall cause the individuals serving as
officers and directors of Anchor and Bank immediately before the Effective
Time to be covered for a period of three (3) years from the Effective Time by
the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by Anchor
(provided that ONB may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to such officers and directors than such policy) with respect to
acts or omissions occurring before the Effective Time; provided, further,
that in no event shall ONB be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.05
more than an amount per year equal to 300% of the annual premiums paid by
Anchor as of the Effective Time for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount");
provided, however, that if the cost exceeds such limit, ONB shall use its
reasonable efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for
the Insurance Amount.

 



53 6.06 _Short-Swing Trading Exemption_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Board of Directors of ONB shall adopt such resolutions as necessary to cause
any shares of ONB Common Stock to be received by executive officers and
directors of Anchor as part of the Merger Consideration to qualify for the
exemptions provided in Rule 16b-3(d) under the 1934 Act.

6.07 _Material Changes to ONB Disclosure Schedules_. ONB shall promptly
supplement, amend and update, upon the occurrence of any change prior to the
Effective Time, and as of the Effective Time, the ONB Disclosure Schedule with
respect to any matters or events hereafter arising which, if in existence or
having occurred as of the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in the ONB Disclosure Schedule or this Agreement and
including, without limitation, any fact which, if existing or known as of the
date hereof, would have made any of the representations or warranties of ONB
contained herein materially incorrect, untrue or misleading. No such
supplement, amendment or update shall become part of the ONB
Disclosure Schedule unless Anchor shall have first consented in writing with
respect thereto.

6.08 _Governmental Report and Shareholder Information_. Promptly upon its
becoming publicly available, ONB shall furnish to Anchor one (1) copy of each
financial statement, report, notice or proxy statement sent by ONB to any
Governmental Authority or to ONBs shareholders generally, each SEC Report
filed by ONB with the SEC or any successor agency and any order issued by any
Governmental Authority in any proceeding to which ONB is a party.

 

6.09 _Charitable Donation Pool_. Promptly following the Effective Time,
ONB shall establish a pool of funds, in an aggregate amount equal to not less
than $100,000, to be used to make one or more donations to charitable
organizations located in Anchors market area. Before and after the Effective
Time, ONB shall consult with the members of Anchors management team to
determine which organizations should be allocated a portion of the pooled
funds and the terms of payment for any such payments.

57 ARTICLE VIII.

 

TERMINATION OF MERGER

 

8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any
time prior to the Closing Date, only as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of ONB and Anchor;

 

(b) by either of Anchor or ONB by written notice to the other:

 

(i) if the Agreement and the Merger are not approved by the requisite vote
of the shareholders of Anchor at the meeting of shareholders of Anchor
contemplated in Section 5.01;

(ii) if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued an order, decree, judgment or injunction or taken any other action that
permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits or makes illegal the
consummation of the Merger, and such order, decree, judgment, injunction or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable or if any consent or
approval of any Governmental Authority the consent or approval of which is
required to consummate the Merger has been denied and such denial has become
final and non-appealable; or

 

(iii) if the consummation of the Merger shall not have occurred on or
before June 30, 2018 (the "Outside Date"); provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(iii) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement causes
the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the Outside Date;

(c) by written notice from ONB to Anchor if:

 

(i) any event shall have occurred which is not capable of being cured prior
to the Outside Date and would result in any condition set forth in Section
7.01 not being satisfied prior to the Outside Date;

 

(ii) Anchor breaches or fails to perform any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
7.01, and such condition is incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date
or such breach has not been cured by Anchor within twenty (20) business days
after Anchors receipt of written notice of such breach from ONB;

 

(iii) there has been a Material Adverse Effect on Anchor on a consolidated
basis as of the Effective Time, as compared to that in existence as of the
date of this Agreement; or

 



58 (iv) ONB elects to exercise its right to terminate pursuant to Section
5.11.

(d) by written notice from Anchor to ONB if:

 

(i) any event shall have occurred which is not capable of being cured prior
to the Outside Date and would result in any condition set forth in Section
7.02 not being satisfied prior to the Outside Date;

 

(ii) ONB breaches or fails to perform any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
7.02, and such condition is incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date
or such breach has not been cured by ONB within twenty (20) business days
after ONBs receipt of written notice of such breach from Anchor; or

 

(iii) there has been a Material Adverse Effect on ONB on a consolidated
basis as of the Effective Time, as compared to that in existence as of the
date of this Agreement.

(e) by written notice of ONB to Anchor if the Anchor Board of Directors
shall fail to include its recommendation to approve the Merger in the proxy
statement/prospectus;

 

(i) in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change;

 

(ii) if the Anchor Board shall approve any Acquisition Proposal or publicly
recommend that the holders of Anchor Common Stock accept or approve any
Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) if Anchor shall have entered into, or publicly announced its
intention to enter into, a definitive agreement, agreement in principle or
letter of intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(iv) if the Anchor Board fails to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement within five (5) business days of a written request by ONB to provide
such reaffirmation.

 

(f) by written notice by ONB to Anchor if a quorum could not be convened at
the meeting of shareholders of Anchor contemplated in Section 5.01 or at a
reconvened meeting held at any time prior to or on the Outside Date.

 

(g) by written notice by Anchor to ONB if, the Average ONB Closing Price is
less than $15.00 per share; _subject_ ,  _however_ , to the following two
sentences. If Anchor elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this
Section 8.01(g), it shall give prompt written notice thereof to ONB. During
the five (5) business day period commencing with its receipt of such notice,
ONB shall have the option to increase the Common Stock Cash Consideration per
share by an amount equal to the difference between (A) $22.875 per share, and
(B) the sum of (1) the 

 



59  Common Stock Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Average ONB Closing Price plus
(2) $2.625 per share. A sample calculation of such amount, assuming an Average
ONB Closing Price of $13.00, is set forth on _Exhibit 8.01(g)_. If within
such five (5) business day period, ONB delivers written notice to Anchor that
it intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional consideration
as contemplated by the preceding sentence, and notifies Anchor of the revised
Common Stock Cash Consideration, then no termination shall have occurred
pursuant to this Section 8.01(g), and this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms (except that the Common Stock
Cash Consideration shall have been so modified). If ONB declares or effects a
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, the prices for the ONB Common Stock shall be
appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 8.01(g).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall ONB pay cash pursuant to
this Section 8.01(g) to the extent that such payment (together with any other
cash paid as consideration) would result in the Merger failing to satisfy the
continuity of interest requirement applicable to reorganizations under Treas.
Reg. Section 1.368-1(e) (using 40% as the minimum value of the proprietary
interest in Anchor that must be preserved in the reorganization). In the event
of any such reduced cash payment, the Common Stock Exchange Ratio shall be
increased accordingly.

(h) by written notice by Anchor to ONB if, prior to the special meeting of
Anchors shareholders to approve the Merger, (i) Anchor has received a
Superior Proposal, and in accordance with Section 5.06 of this Agreement, has
entered into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal,
or (ii) if Anchors Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with Anchors outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that
the failure of Anchors Board of Directors to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Anchor under applicable Law.

 

8.02 _Effect of Termination_. (a) Subject to the remainder of this Section
8.02, in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect,
without any liability on the part of ONB or Anchor and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents or shareholders,
and all rights and obligations of any party under this Agreement shall cease,
except for the agreements contained in Section 8.02 and Section 11.11, which
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 8.02(a),
except for the fees payable pursuant to subsections (b), (c), or (d), shall
relieve any party hereto from liabilities or damages arising out of any fraud
or intentional breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement.

 

(b) Anchor shall pay to ONB an amount in cash equal to $11,400,000 (the
"Termination Fee") if:

 

(1) this Agreement is terminated by ONB pursuant to Section 8.01(e); or

 

(2) this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i) as a result of the failure of Anchors shareholders to approve the
Agreement and the Merger by the requisite vote or by ONB pursuant to Section
8.01(f) and, in each case,

 



60  prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after such termination Anchor
or any Anchor Subsidiary enters into any Acquisition Agreement or any
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (regardless of whether such Acquisition
Proposal is made or consummated before or after termination of this
Agreement); or

 

(3) this Agreement is terminated by either Anchor or ONB pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(iii) and (A) prior to the date of such termination, an
Acquisition Proposal was made, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12)
months after such termination, Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary enters into any
Acquisition Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal is consummated; or

(4) this Agreement is terminated by Anchor pursuant to Section 8.01(h).

(c) Any fee due under Section 8.02(b) shall be paid by Anchor by
wire transfer of same day funds:

(1) in the case of Section 8.02(b)(1) or Section 8.02(b)(4), concurrently
with such termination; and

(2) in the case of Section 8.02(b)(2) or Section 8.02(b)(3), on the
earlier of the date Anchor enters into such Acquisition Agreement or
consummates such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) In the event that Anchor owes the Termination Fee to ONB pursuant to
Section 8.02(b), then the payment of such amount shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for those termination events and shall constitute liquidated
damages. Anchor acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, ONB would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Anchor fails promptly to pay the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 8.02, and, in order to obtain such payment, ONB
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Anchor for the amounts
set forth in this Section 8.02, Anchor shall pay to ONB its reasonable costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in this Section 8.02 at the national prime rate in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made.

favor of the current or former directors or officers of Anchor and Anchor
Subsidiaries as provided in its respective charter or by-laws and any existing
indemnification agreements or arrangements of Anchor described in the Anchor
Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms to the extent permitted by law, and

years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring or

proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or

threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or
was a director, officer or employee of Anchor or its predecessors or (ii) this

Agreement dated May 9, 2017, by and between Anchor and ONB (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). Upon the execution of this Agreement by all the
parties hereto, any and all other prior writings of either party relating to
the Merger, will terminate and will be rendered of no further force or
effect. The parties hereto agree that each party and its counsel reviewed and

 _SAMPLE CALCULATION_

 

Assumptions:



     |  |  | Average ONB Closing Price: $13.00 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Anchor provides written notice to ONB to terminate
Agreement 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | ONB exercises option to increase Common Stock Cash
Consideration per share pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 8.01(g) 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | No other adjustments to the Merger Consideration 
---|---|---|--- 

Calculation of Increase in Common Stock Cash Consideration:

An amount equal to the difference between (A) $22.875 per share, and (B) the
sum of (1) the Common Stock Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Average ONB
Closing Price plus (2) $2.625 per share:

$22.875  ((1.350 x $13.00) + $2.625)

 

=

$22.875  ($17.55 + $2.625) 

=

$22.875 - $20.175

 

=

_$2.700_

 

Calculation of Adjusted Merger Consideration:

Each share of Anchor Common Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive:



     |  |  | 1.350 shares of ONB Common Stock; plus 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | $2.625 in cash, which represents the initial Common Stock
Cash Consideration; plus 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | $2.700 in cash, which represents the increase in the
Common Stock Cash Consideration 
---|---|---|--- 

The total value of the per share Merger Consideration would equal $22.875,
calculated as follows:

$17.55 (1.350 x $13.00) + $2.625 + $2.700 = $22.875
