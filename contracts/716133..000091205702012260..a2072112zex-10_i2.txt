charges (including any HVAC charges) and commissions paid by tenants;   (ii)
utility company charges, including electricity, gas,  fuel, water and sewer
charges;     (iii) general and special assessments and other public or 
private charges affecting the Leased Property; and   (iv) other items
typically apportioned in sale of assets  transactions of the type
contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 1.04. CONSENTS OF THIRD PARTIES.
(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any asset or any claim
or right or any benefit arising under or resulting from such asset if an
attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party, would
constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of such third party,
would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement concerning
such asset, or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller or
Seller Sub or, upon transfer, Purchaser under such asset. If any transfer or
assignment by Seller or Seller Sub to, or any assumption by Purchaser of, any
interest in, or liability, obligation or commitment under, any asset requires
the consent of a third party, then such assignment or assumption shall be
made subject to such consent being obtained.   (b) If any such consent is
not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller, Seller Sub and Purchaser shall
cooperate (at their own expense) in any lawful and reasonable arrangement
reasonably proposed by Purchaser under which Purchaser shall obtain the
economic claims, rights and benefits under the asset, claim or right with
respect to which the consent has not been obtained in accordance with this
Agreement. Such reasonable arrangement may include (i) the subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing to Purchaser of any and all rights of Seller and
Seller Sub against the other party to such third-party agreement arising out
of a breach or cancelation thereof by the other party and (ii)
the enforcement by Seller or Seller Sub of such rights.      9  
SECTION 1.05. PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. (a) Within 60 days after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the
"STATEMENT"), certified by Purchaser\'s independent auditors, setting forth
Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date ("CLOSING
WORKING CAPITAL") and a certificate of Purchaser that the Statement has been
prepared in compliance with the requirements of this Section 1.05. Seller\'s
independent auditors may participate in the preparation of the Statement and
review working papers of Purchaser\'s accountants; provided, however, that
Seller acknowledges that Purchaser shall have the primary responsibility and
authority for preparing the Statement and Purchaser\'s independent auditors
shall have the primary responsibility and authority for certifying the
Statement.   (b) During the 30-day period following Seller\'s receipt of
the Statement, Seller and its independent auditors shall be permitted to
review the working papers relating to the Statement and Purchaser shall
cooperate with Seller and its independent auditors to provide them with any
other information used in preparing the Statement reasonably requested by
Seller and their independent auditors. The Statement shall become final and
binding upon the parties on the 30th day following delivery thereof, unless
Seller gives written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a "NOTICE
OF DISAGREEMENT") to Purchaser prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so
asserted and (ii) only include disagreements based on errors of fact or
mathematical errors in the Balance Sheet and/or the Statement or based on
Closing Working Capital not being calculated in accordance with this Section
1.05. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Purchaser in a timely
manner, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence)
shall become final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser on the earlier of
(A) the date Seller and Purchaser resolve in writing any differences they
have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or
(B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the
Accounting Firm. During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. During such period Purchaser and its
auditors shall have access to the working papers of Seller\'s
auditors prepared in connection with their certification of the Notice of
Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period, Seller and Purchaser shall
submit to an independent accounting firm (the "ACCOUNTING FIRM") for
arbitration any and all matters that remain in dispute and were properly
included in the Notice of Disagreement, in the form of a written brief. The
Accounting Firm shall be Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if such firm is unable or
unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent public
accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the parties hereto in writing.
Seller and Purchaser agree to use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting
Firm to render a decision resolving any matters submitted to the Accounting
Firm within 30 days following submission. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over
the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The cost of any
arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and
reasonable attorney fees and expenses of the parties) pursuant to
this Section        10  1.05 shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller
in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by
the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The fees and disbursements
of Purchaser\'s independent auditors incurred in connection with their
certification of the Statement and review of any Notice of Disagreement shall
be borne by Purchaser, and the fees and disbursements of Seller\'s
independent auditors incurred in connection with their review of the
Statement and any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Seller.   (c) The
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which Closing Working
Capital exceeds $16,657,500 (the "WC AMOUNT"), and the Purchase Price shall
be decreased by the amount by which Closing Working Capital is less than the
WC Amount (the Purchase Price as so increased or decreased shall hereinafter
be referred to as the "ADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE"). If the Purchase Price is
less than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall, and if the Purchase
Price is more than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall, within 5
business days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the parties,
make payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds of the amount of
such difference, together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate
of interest from time to time announced publicly by Citibank, N.A., as
its prime rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the date of payment.   (d) The
term "WORKING CAPITAL" means Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. The
terms "CURRENT ASSETS" and "CURRENT LIABILITIES" mean the current assets and
current liabilities, respectively, of the Business, calculated in the same
way, using the same accounting methods, as the line items on the Balance
Sheet (which in each case for purposes of this Section 1.05 shall exclude any
Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities). Attached hereto as Schedule 1.05
is a form of the Working Capital Statement that identifies the specific line
items and adjustments that will be included in Working Capital. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Closing Working Capital is to be
calculated in the same way, using the same accounting methods, as the
line items comprising Working Capital on the Balance Sheet, whether or not
doing so is in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"). The foregoing principles are referred to in this
Agreement as the "BALANCE SHEET PRINCIPLES". The adjustment contemplated by
this Section 1.05 is intended to show the change in Working Capital from the
date of the Balance Sheet to the Closing Date, and such change can only be
measured if the calculation is done in the same way using the same accounting
methods, for both dates. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Accounting Firm shall be limited to disputes concerning whether such
calculation was done in accordance with the Balance Sheet Principles, and
whether there were errors of fact or mathematical errors in the Statement or
the Balance Sheet, and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other
determination, including any determination as to whether GAAP was followed
for the Balance Sheet or the Statement or as to whether the WC Amount is
correct. Any items on or omissions from the Balance Sheet that are not in
accordance with      11  GAAP, but which are in accordance with the
Balance Sheet Principles, shall be retained for purposes of calculating
Closing Working Capital.   (e) To the extent such actions could affect the
Statement, from the Closing through the full and complete resolution of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.05, Purchaser
shall not take any actions with respect to the accounting books and records
of the Business on which the Statement is to be based that are not consistent
with the past practice of the Business. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, during such period, no changes shall be made in any reserve or
other account existing as of the date of the Balance Sheet except as a result
of events occurring after the date of the Balance Sheet and, in such event,
only in a manner consistent with the Balance Sheet Principles. Seller shall
assist Purchaser in the preparation of the Statement, including providing
customary certifications to Purchaser\'s auditors. During the period of time
from and after the Closing Date through the full and complete resolution of
any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.05,
Seller shall afford to Purchaser and any accountants, counsel or financial
advisors retained by Purchaser in connection with any adjustment to the
Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.05 reasonable access during
normal business hours to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and
records of the Business retained or controlled by Seller relevant to the
adjustment contemplated by this Section 1.05. During the period of time from
and after the Closing Date through the full and complete resolution of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.05, Purchaser
shall afford to Seller and any accountants, counsel or financial advisors
retained by Seller in connection with any adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by this Section 1.05 reasonable access during normal business
hours to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records of the
Business retained or controlled by Purchaser relevant to the adjustment
contemplated by this Section 1.05.   (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 1.05, no adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant
to this Section 1.05 shall be made unless such adjustment would exceed
$100,000, and if the adjustment would exceed $100,000, then the full amount
of the adjustment shall be made.   ARTICLE II   THE CLOSING   SECTION
2.01. CLOSING DATE. The closing of the Acquisition (the "CLOSING") shall take
place at the offices of Latham and Watkins, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New

satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted, the waiver) of the conditions set

the party entitled to the        12  benefit thereof), as soon as
practicable after all the conditions set forth in Article VI have been

benefits thereof), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed
between Seller and Purchaser. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the "CLOSING DATE".   SECTION 2.02.

of the conditions and compliance with the  covenants set forth in this
Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER that the terms  of such deeds, bills of sale,

increase in the obligations of Seller  or Seller Sub beyond those
contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Purchaser shall deliver to Seller and
Seller Sub (i)  payment, by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
writing by  Seller (such designation to be made at least two business days

giving effect to such issuance), (iii) such  appropriately executed
assumption agreements and other instruments of  assumption providing for the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in  form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and its counsel  and (iv) such other documents as
Seller or its counsel may reasonably  request to demonstrate satisfaction of
the conditions and compliance  with the covenants set forth in this
Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER that  the terms of such assumption agreements
and other instruments and  documents shall not result in an increase in the
obligations of  Purchaser beyond those contemplated by this Agreement.  
SECTION 2.03. RISK OF LOSS. Until the Closing, any loss of or damage to the
Acquired Assets from fire, casualty or any other occurrence not covered by
insurance payable to Purchaser shall be the sole responsibility of Seller or
Seller Sub, as applicable.   ARTICLE III        13  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND SELLER SUB   Subject to the
second sentence of Section 9.04(a), Seller and Seller Sub hereby jointly and
severally represent and warrant to Purchaser, as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date, as follows:   SECTION 3.01.
ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Each of Seller and Seller Sub is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and
authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease
or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct the Business and
its other businesses as presently conducted, other than such franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Business Material Adverse Effect. A "BUSINESS MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" shall
mean any change or effect that is reasonably likely to (i) have a material
adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Business or (ii) prevent or materially impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation by Seller or Seller Sub of
the Acquisition or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement, in each case other than changes relating to United
States or foreign economies or securities markets or the industries in which
the Business operates and not specifically relating to the Business.
Purchaser acknowledges that there may have been or may be disruption to the
Business as a result of Seller\'s intention to sell the Business or as a
result of the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or announcement thereof, and
Purchaser acknowledges that such disruptions do not and shall not constitute
a Business Material Adverse Effect. Each of Seller and Seller Sub is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in (A) each jurisdiction
where the character of the Acquired Assets held by it or the nature of the
Business make such qualification necessary for it to conduct the Business as
currently conducted by it or the failure to so qualify could reasonably be
expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect and (B), in the case of
Seller Sub, Ohio and Kentucky. Seller has delivered to Purchaser true and
complete copies of the respective certificates of incorporation and by-laws
of Seller and Seller Sub, in each case as amended through the date of this
Agreement.   SECTION 3.02. AUTHORITY; EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY; ENFORCEABILITY. Each of Seller and Seller Sub has full power and
authority to execute this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is, or is specified to be, a party and to consummate the Acquisition and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and
delivery by each of Seller and Seller Sub of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is, or is specified to be, a party and the
consummation by each of Seller and Seller Sub of the Acquisition and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action. Seller, as the sole stockholder of Seller
Sub, has authorized the Acquisition and the other transactions       
14  contemplated hereby. No other corporate proceedings on the part of
Seller or Seller Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
Each of Seller and Seller Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement
and prior to the Closing will have duly executed and delivered each Ancillary
Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be, a party, and this Agreement
constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to
be, a party will after the Closing constitute, its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.   SECTION
3.03. NO CONFLICTS; CONSENTS. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.03, the
execution and delivery by Seller and Seller Sub of this Agreement do not, the
execution and delivery by Seller and Seller Sub of each Ancillary Agreement
to which it is, or is specified to be, a party will not, and the consummation
of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
and compliance by Seller and Seller Sub with the terms hereof and thereof
will not conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of
a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Seller or any of its subsidiaries, under any
provision of (a) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Seller or any
of its subsidiaries, (b) any Contract to which Seller or Seller Sub is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or
(c) any judgment, order or decree ("JUDGMENT") or statute, law, ordinance,
rule or regulation ("APPLICABLE LAW") applicable to Seller or any of its
subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the
case of clauses (b) and (c) above, any such items that, individually or in
the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Business Material
Adverse Effect. No material consent, approval, license, permit, order or
authorization ("CONSENT") of, or material registration, declaration or filing
with, any Federal, state, local or foreign government or any court of
competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission or other
governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a
"GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY"), is required to be obtained or made by or with respect
to Seller or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the consummation of the Acquisition or the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, other than (i) compliance with and filings
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR
ACT"), or (ii) other filings or approvals that individually or in the
aggregate could not reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 3.04. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a)
Schedule 3.04(a) sets forth for the Business (i) audited balance sheets as of
December 31, 2000 and 2001 (such December 31, 2001 balance sheet being
referred to herein as the "BALANCE SHEET") and (ii) audited statements of
income and cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and
2001 (the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). The Financial Statements have been
examined by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent certified public
accountants, whose report thereon is included with such
Financial        15  Statements. The Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as specifically described in
Schedule 3.04) consistently applied and fairly and accurately present in all
material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the
Business as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated.   (b) The Business does not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unasserted
or otherwise) of a nature required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Business that could reasonably be expected to have a
Business Material Adverse Effect, except (i) as disclosed, reflected or
reserved against in the Balance Sheet and the notes thereto, (ii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of the Business
consistent with past practice since the date of the Balance Sheet and not in
violation of this Agreement, (iii) for Taxes and (iv) as set forth on
Schedule 3.04(b). This representation shall not be deemed breached as a
result of a change in law after the Closing Date.   SECTION 3.05. ASSETS
OTHER THAN REAL PROPERTY INTERESTS. (a) Seller or Seller Sub has and will
transfer to Purchaser good and marketable title to all the Acquired Assets,
in each case free and clear of all mortgages, liens, security interests,
charges, easements, leases, subleases, covenants, rights of way, options,
claims, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind (collectively, "LIENS"),
except (i) such Liens as are set forth in Schedule 3.05, (ii) (A)
mechanics\', carriers\', workmen\'s, repairmen\'s or other like Liens arising
or incurred in the ordinary course of business and not material in amount,
(B) Liens arising under original purchase price conditional sales contracts
and equipment leases with third parties entered into in the ordinary course
of business and (C) Liens for current Taxes that are not yet due and payable
and (iii) other imperfections of title or encumbrances, if any,
that individually or in the aggregate, do not impair in any material respect
the continued use and operation of the assets to which they relate in the
conduct of the Business as presently conducted (the Liens described above,
together with the Liens referred to in clauses (b) through (e) of Section
3.06, are referred to collectively as "PERMITTED LIENS").   (b) This
Section 3.05 does not relate to Leased Property, which is addressed in
Section 3.06, or to Intellectual Property, which is addressed in Section
3.07.   SECTION 3.06. LEASED PROPERTY. Schedule 3.06(a) sets forth
a complete list of all real property and interests in real property leased
by Seller or Seller Sub and used, held for use or intended to be used
primarily in the operation or conduct of the Business (individually, a
"LEASED PROPERTY"). Each lease on Schedule 3.06(a) that is an "Assigned
Contract" is clearly denoted as such. Seller or Seller Sub has good and valid
title to the leasehold estates in all Leased Property free and clear of all
Liens, except (a) Liens described in clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 3.05(a),
(b) such Liens as are set forth in Schedule 3.06(b), (c) subleases and
similar agreements set forth in Schedule 3.08, (d) easements, covenants,
rights-of-way and other similar restrictions of record, and (e) (i) zoning,
building        16  and other similar restrictions, and (ii) Liens
that have been placed by any developer, landlord or other third party on
property over which Seller or Seller Sub has easement rights or on any Leased
Property and subordination or similar agreements relating thereto. None of
the items set forth in clause (e) above, individually or in the aggregate,
impairs in any material respect the continued use and operation of the Leased
Property to which they relate in the conduct of the Business as presently
conducted.   SECTION 3.07 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.   (a) GENERALLY. Schedule
3.07(a) sets forth, with respect to the (i) trademarks and service marks
(whether registered or unregistered), trade names, designs and general
intangibles of like nature, together with all goodwill related to the
foregoing (collectively, "TRADEMARKS"); (ii) patents and patent applications
(including any continuations, continuations-in-part, divisionals, reissues,
renewals and applications for any of the foregoing) (collectively "PATENTS");
(iii) copyrights and mask works (including any registrations and applications
therefore and whether registered or unregistered) (collectively
"COPYRIGHTS"); and (iv) domain names, including the top-level Internet domain
names and all lower-level Internet domain names for which such top-level
domains are a root or parent, whether in the form of an address for use in
electronic mail transfer, a Universal Resource Locator, a File
Transfer Protocol location, or other form suitable for specifying the
location of an electronic data file over a distributed computer network
(collectively, "DOMAIN NAMES"), in each case owned by or licensed to Seller
or Seller Sub and used primarily in the Business, including jointly with
others (such schedule specifying if such Intellectual Property is owned
jointly), a complete and accurate list of all United States and foreign (a)
Patents, Patent applications and Patent applications currently in process,
(b) Trademark registrations and applications currently in progress, and (c)
Copyright registrations and applications, indicating for each, the applicable
jurisdiction, registration number (or application number) and date issued (or
date filed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that
neither Seller nor Seller Sub represent that Schedule 3.07(a) constitutes a
comprehensive list of all unregistered Trademarks in which Seller or Seller
Sub might claim common law trademark or service mark rights that nevertheless
constitute Acquired Assets.   (b) TRADEMARKS. (i) All Trademarks of Seller
or Seller Sub used primarily in the Business for which an application for
trademark registration has been filed are currently in compliance with all
legal requirements (including the timely post-registration filing of
affidavits of use and incontestability and renewal applications) other than
any requirement that, if not satisfied, would not result in a cancelation of
any such registration or otherwise affect the use, priority or enforceability
of the Trademark in question. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.07(b)(i), no
registered Trademark of Seller or Seller Sub used primarily in the Business
is involved in any opposition or cancelation proceeding in the United States
Patent and Trademark Office. To Seller\'s knowledge, no such action has been
threatened in writing, which threatened action remains unresolved or
outstanding. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.07(b)(i), there has been, to
the knowledge of Seller or Seller Sub, no prior use        17  of
any Trademark of Seller or Seller Sub by any third party that confers
upon said third party superior rights in any such Trademark.   (ii) Except
as set forth in Schedule 3.07(b)(ii), Seller or Seller Sub is the owner of
all right, title and interest in and to all of the Trademarks used primarily
in the Business, in each case free and clear of any and all encumbrances,
covenants, conditions and restrictions or other adverse claims or interests
of any kind or nature, and neither Seller nor Seller Sub has received any
written notice or claim or to its knowledge, any oral notice or claim, which
claim remains unresolved or outstanding, challenging its complete and
exclusive ownership of the Trademarks or suggesting that any other person has
any claim of legal or beneficial ownership with respect thereto. There is no
agreement, decree, arbitral award or other provision or contingency which
obligates Seller or Seller Sub to grant licenses in future Trademarks
used primarily in the Business.   (c) PATENTS. No Patents owned by Seller
or Seller Sub have been or are currently used in the Business and, to the
knowledge of Seller and Seller Sub, no such Patents are required to conduct
the Business after the Closing.     (d) COPYRIGHTS. Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.07(d):   (i) Seller or Seller Sub is the owner of all right,
title and  interest in and to each of the Copyrights used primarily in the 
Business other than those as to which the rights being exercised by  Seller
or Seller Sub have been licensed from another person  (collectively, "SELLER
OWNED COPYRIGHTS"), free and clear of any and  all encumbrances, covenants,
conditions and restrictions or other  adverse claims or interests of any kind
or nature, and neither Seller  nor Seller Sub has received any written or, to
its knowledge, oral  notice or claim, which claim remains unresolved or
outstanding,  challenging its complete and exclusive ownership of the
Copyrights or  suggesting that any other person has any claim of legal or
beneficial  ownership with respect thereto.   (ii) Neither Seller nor
Seller Sub has received any written  or, to its knowledge, oral notice or
claim, which claim remains  unresolved or outstanding, challenging or
questioning the validity or  enforceability of any of the Seller Owned
Copyrights or indicating an  intention on the part of any person to bring a
claim that any Seller  Owned Copyright is invalid, is unenforceable or has
been misused.   (iii) Neither Seller nor Seller Sub has taken any action
or  used or enforced (or failed to enforce) any of the Seller Owned 
Copyrights, in each case in a manner that would result in the 
unenforceability of any of the Seller Owned Copyrights. Seller and  Seller
Sub have taken all steps reasonably necessary to protect their  rights in and
to the Seller Owned Copyrights, in each case in  accordance with standard
industry practice. To the knowledge of Seller  and        18  
Seller Sub, no other person has infringed or is infringing in any  material
respect any of the Seller Owned Copyrights.   (iv) Neither Seller nor Seller
Sub has granted to any person  any right, license or permission to exercise
any rights under any of  the Seller Owned Copyrights other than non-exclusive
licenses granted  in the ordinary course of business to customers.   (e)
TRADE SECRETS. Seller Sub has a written policy regarding trade secrets in
accordance with normal industry practice and has taken commercially
reasonable steps to enforce such policy and to protect its rights in
confidential information and proprietary information, including any
formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or
process, that: (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential,
from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can
obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is the subject of
efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy
(collectively, "TRADE SECRETS").   (f) LICENSE AGREEMENTS. (i) Schedule
3.07(f)(i) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all license agreements
granting to Seller or Seller Sub any right to use or practice any rights
under any Intellectual Property used primarily in the Business (other than
software commercially available on reasonable terms to any person for a
license fee of no more than $10,000, but including all such agreements that
are otherwise material to Seller or Seller Sub) (collectively, the "SELLER
INBOUND LICENSE AGREEMENTS"), indicating for each the title and the parties
thereto.   (ii) Schedule 3.07(f)(ii) sets forth a complete and accurate 
list of all license agreements under which Seller or Seller Sub grants  any
rights in or to use or practice any rights under any Intellectual  Property
used primarily in the Business (collectively, the "SELLER  OUTBOUND LICENSE
AGREEMENTS"), indicating for each the title and the  parties thereto.  
(iii) There is no outstanding or, to Seller\'s and Seller Sub\'s  knowledge,
threatened dispute or disagreement with respect to any  Seller Inbound
License Agreement or any Seller Outbound License  Agreement. Correct and
complete executed copies of all Seller Inbound  License Agreements and Seller
Outbound License Agreements have been  delivered to Purchaser.   (g)
OWNERSHIP; SUFFICIENCY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS. Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.07(g), Seller and Seller Sub each owns or possesses adequate
licenses or other rights to use, free and clear of encumbrances (except in
the case of licenses, the interests of the licensing party), orders,
arbitration awards and contingent licenses arising from termination
provisions (or other causes) in agreements between them and any other person,
all of the Intellectual Property assets necessary to conduct the Business as
currently conducted. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.07(g),
the Intellectual        19  Property identified in Section
1.02(a)(v) and in Schedule 3.07(a), together with Trade Secrets, Licensed
Trademarks, Seller Owned Copyrights and Seller\'s and Seller Sub\'s
unregistered Copyrights and Seller\'s and Seller Sub\'s rights granted to
them under the Seller Inbound License Agreements, constitute all
the Intellectual Property rights and Seller Inbound License Agreements
used primarily in the operation of the Business as currently conducted and
are all such Intellectual Property rights and Seller Inbound License
Agreements necessary to operate such business after the Closing in
substantially the same manner as such businesses have been operated by Seller
and Seller Sub during the 12 months prior to the Closing.   (h) NO
INFRINGEMENT BY SELLER. No litigation is pending and neither Seller nor
Seller Sub has received any written or, to its knowledge, oral notice or
claim (A) alleging that Seller or Seller Sub has engaged in any activity or
conduct related primarily to the Business that infringes upon, violates or
constitutes the unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property rights of any
third party, or (B) challenging the ownership, use, validity
or enforceability of any Intellectual Property used primarily in the Business
which are owned or exclusively licensed by or to Seller or Seller Sub. No
Intellectual Property that is owned or licensed by Seller or Seller Sub for
use primarily in the Business is subject to any outstanding order, judgment,
decree, stipulation or agreement restricting the use thereof by Seller or
Seller Sub.   (i) NO INFRINGEMENT BY THIRD PARTIES. To the knowledge
of Seller and Seller Sub, no third party is misappropriating, infringing,
diluting or violating any Intellectual Property owned or exclusively licensed
by Seller or Seller Sub for use primarily in the Business, and no claims for
any of the foregoing have been brought against any third party by Seller or
Seller Sub.   (j) ASSIGNMENT; CHANGE OF CONTROL. Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.07(j), the execution, delivery and performance by Seller and
Seller Sub of this Agreement and each of the other documents contemplated
hereby to which either is a party, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, will not result in the loss or impairment
of, or give rise to any right of any third party to terminate, any of
Seller\'s or Seller Sub\'s rights to own any of its Intellectual Property
used primarily in the Business or rights under any Seller Inbound License
Agreement or Seller Outbound License Agreement, nor require the consent of
any Governmental Entity or third party in respect of any such Intellectual
Property.   (k) WEBSITES. Seller Sub is the sole owner of the Domain Names,
and all such Domain Names are currently registered by Seller Sub, as
sole owner, with an ICANN accredited registrar, and the registration fees are
paid through the dates listed on Schedule 5.24. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.07 (k), Seller Sub is the owner or authorized licensee of all
Content and no consent, license, approval or authorization of, registration
or declaration with, or notice to, any governmental authority, agency, bureau
or commission is required to be obtained or made by Seller Sub
in        20  connection with the execution, delivery, performance,
validity, or enforceability of this Agreement or the sale or transfer of the
ownership of the Domain Names and continued use of the Content by Purchaser.
Neither Seller nor Seller Sub is aware of any facts or circumstances that
could reasonably form the basis of a challenge relating to Purchaser\'s
unencumbered use of the Websites, Content, or any part thereof.   SECTION
3.08. CONTRACTS. (a) Except for Contracts relating primarily to Excluded
Assets and except as set forth on Schedule 3.08, neither Seller nor Seller
Sub is a party to or bound by any Contract, including any supplement,
amendment or revision thereto, that is used, held for use or intended for use
primarily in, or that arises primarily out of, the operation or conduct of
the Business and that is:   (i) a written employment agreement or employment
contract that  has an aggregate future liability in excess of $85,000 and is
not  terminable by Seller or Seller Sub by notice of not more than 60 days 
for a cost of less than $25,000;   (ii) a collective bargaining agreement or
other Contract with  any labor organization, union or association;   (iii)
a Contract pursuant to which following the Closing would  (A) materially
limit the ability of Purchaser to compete with any  person or to engage in
any activity or business, or pursuant to which  any benefit is required to be
given or lost as a result of so competing  or engaging; or (B) limit the
ability of Purchaser to solicit or hire  any employee, consultant or other
entity for the purpose of providing  services to Purchaser in connection with
the Business;   (iv) a Contract with (A) any shareholder or affiliate of 
Seller or (B) any officer, director or employee of Seller or any of its

of  $100,000 and is not terminable by Seller or Seller Sub by notice of not 
more than 60 days for a cost of less than $25,000;         21  
(vii) (A) a continuing Contract for the future purchase of  materials,

notice of the decision of any of the Top Customers not to continue such Top
Customer\'s relationship with the Business following the expiration of such
Contract or to materially reduce its purchases from the Business. The form
agreement used by the Business relating to the sale of advertising to
customers is attached to Schedule 3.08.   (c) Each Contract listed on
Schedule 3.08 that is an "Assigned Contract" is clearly denoted as such. All
Contracts listed in the Schedules are valid, binding and in full force and
effect and are enforceable by Seller or Seller Sub, as applicable, in
accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws
affecting creditors\' rights generally from time to time in effect and to
general principles of equity, including concepts of
materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. Seller and Seller Sub
have performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under
the Assigned Contracts, and they are not (with or without the lapse of time
or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default in any material
respect thereunder, neither Seller nor Seller Sub has liability for any
material delinquent fees under the Assigned Contracts and, to the knowledge
of Seller, no other party to any Assigned Contract is (with or without the
lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default in any
material respect thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Seller
nor Seller Sub has, except as disclosed in the applicable Schedule, received
any notice of the intention of any party to terminate any Assigned Contract
listed in any Schedule. Seller Sub has delivered to Purchaser true and
correct copies of (i) the letter dated January 29, 2002 from Seller Sub to
L.M. Berry and Co. ("BERRY") and countersigned by Berry, pursuant to which
Berry has consented to the assignment to Purchaser of a certain contract
between Seller Sub and Berry and (ii) each Consent to Assignment in favor of
the Bank signed by Berry or Seller.        23   (d) Schedule 3.08
sets forth each Assigned Contract listed on Schedule 3.08 with respect to
which the Consent of the other party or parties thereto must be obtained by
virtue of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Acquisition to avoid the invalidity of the transfer of such Contract, the
termination thereof, a breach, violation or default thereunder or any other
change or modification to the terms thereof. In addition, Schedule 3.08 sets
forth each Assigned Contract not listed on Schedule 3.08 with respect to
which the Consent of the other party or parties thereto must be obtained by
virtue of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Acquisition to avoid the invalidity of the transfer of such Contract, the
termination thereof, a breach, violation or default thereunder or any other
change or modification to the terms thereof, other than such Assigned
Contracts the termination of which by any party thereto, individually or in
the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Business Material
Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.09. PERMITS. (a) Schedule 3.09 sets forth
all material certificates, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals ("PERMITS") issued or granted to Seller or Seller Sub by
Governmental Entities that are necessary or desirable for the operation or
conduct of the Business. All such Permits are validly held by Seller or
Seller Sub, and Seller or Seller Sub has complied in all material respects
with all terms and conditions thereof. During the past 12 months, neither
Seller nor Seller Sub has received notice of any Proceedings relating to the
revocation, default or modification of any such Permits. None of such Permits
will be subject to suspension, modification, revocation or nonrenewal as a
result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and no Consent or approvals must by
obtained by virtue of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to avoid the invalidity
of the transfer of such Permit. This Section 3.09 does not relate to
environmental matters, which are the subject of Section 3.17.   (b) Seller
or Seller Sub possesses all Permits to own or hold under lease and operate
the Acquired Assets and to conduct the Business as currently conducted, other
than such Permits the absence of which, individually or in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 3.10. INSURANCE. The material insurance
policies maintained by Seller and Seller Sub with respect to the Business are
listed in Schedule 3.10. All such policies are in full force and effect in
all material respects, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid
(other than retroactive or retrospective premium adjustments that are not
yet, but may be, required to be paid with respect to any period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date), and no notice of cancelation or termination has
been received with respect to any such policy which has not been replaced on
substantially similar terms prior to the date of such
cancelation.         24   SECTION 3.11. SUFFICIENCY OF ACQUIRED
ASSETS. The Acquired Assets, together with the Excluded Assets, comprise all
the assets employed by Seller or Seller Sub in connection with the Business.
The Acquired Assets, together with the services to be provided pursuant to
the Ancillary Agreements, are sufficient for the conduct of Business
immediately following the Closing in substantially the same manner as
currently conducted and there are no assets that are material to the conduct
of the Business as currently conducted other than the Acquired Assets, the
Assigned Contracts and the services to be provided pursuant to the Ancillary
Agreements.   SECTION 3.12. TAXES. (a) For purposes of this Agreement: 
------   "CODE" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  
"POST-CLOSING TAX PERIOD" means any taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date and that portion of a Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date.   "PRE-CLOSING TAX PERIOD" means any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period

foreign) responsible for the imposition of any such tax (a "TAXING
AUTHORITY").   "TAX RETURN" means any return, declaration, report, claim
for refund, or information return or statement relating to Taxes, including
any schedule or attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof.  
(b) LIENS. There are no material Liens for Taxes (other than for current
Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the Acquired Assets.   (c) CLAIMS.
No material deficiencies for Taxes have been claimed in writing by any Taxing
Authority against Seller.        25   (d) INTERESTS IN ENTITIES. None
of the Acquired Assets constitutes (i) an interest in any joint venture,
partnership, or other arrangement or contract which is treated as a
partnership for Tax purposes, (ii) an interest in a single member limited
liability company which is treated as a disregarded entity for Tax purposes,
or (iii) stock in an entity which is treated as a corporation (or any other
entity taxable as a corporation) for Tax purposes.   (e) WITHHOLDING.
Neither Seller nor Seller Sub is a "foreign person" within the meaning of
Section 1445 of the Code.   (f) MISCELLANEOUS. No Acquired Asset is "tax-
exempt bond financed property" or "tax-exempt use property" within the
meaning of Section 168(g) or Section 168(h), respectively, of the Code or any
equivalent provision of state or local Tax law. Seller or Seller Sub is the
owner for Tax purposes of each Acquired Asset.   SECTION 3.13. PROCEEDINGS.
Schedule 3.13 sets forth a list as of the date of this Agreement of each
pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened Proceeding arising out of
the conduct of the Business or against any Acquired Asset and that could
reasonably be expected to (a) result in aggregate future liability in excess
of $500,000, or (b) prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Neither Seller nor Seller Sub is a party or subject to or
in default under any Judgment applicable to the conduct of the Business or
any Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability, other than for such Judgments that,
individually and in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Business Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.14. BENEFIT PLANS. (a)
Schedule 3.14 contains a list of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA")), maintained or contributed to by Seller or any of
its affiliates for the benefit of any Business Employee ("SELLER PENSION
PLANS") and all "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA), bonus, stock option, stock purchase, deferred compensation plans
or arrangements and other employee fringe benefit plans maintained, or
contributed to, by Seller or any of its affiliates for the benefit of any
Business Employee (all the foregoing, including Seller Pension Plans, being
herein called "SELLER BENEFIT PLANS"). Seller has made available to Purchaser
true, complete and correct copies of (i) each Seller Benefit Plan, (ii) the
most recent annual report on Form 5500 filed with the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to each Seller Benefit Plan (if any such report was
required), (iii) the most recent summary plan description for each Seller
Benefit Plan for which such a summary plan description is required and (iv)
each trust agreement, group annuity contract or other funding and
financing arrangement relating to any Seller Benefit Plan.   (b) Each
Seller Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms, other
than as could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Business Material        26  Adverse Effect. Seller and
all the Seller Benefit Plans are in compliance with the applicable provisions
of ERISA and the Code and all applicable collective bargaining agreements,
other than as could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect.   (c) No Business
Employee is covered by a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA).   (d) Seller has not incurred any cost, fee, expense,
liability, claim, suit, obligation or other damage under Title IV of ERISA
that could give rise to the imposition of any liability, cost, fee, expense
or obligation which would reasonably be expected to become a liability of
Purchaser and, to Seller\'s and Seller Sub\'s knowledge, no facts or
circumstances exist that could give rise to any such cost, fee, expense,
liability, claim, suit, obligation or other damage, which would be reasonably
expected to become a liability of Purchaser.   SECTION 3.15. ABSENCE OF
CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since the date of the Balance Sheet, there has not been
any change that individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. From the date of the
Balance Sheet to the date of this Agreement, Seller and Seller Sub have
caused the Business to be conducted in the ordinary course and in
substantially the same manner as previously conducted, other than as could
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Business Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of the Balance Sheet to
the date of this Agreement, neither Seller nor Seller Sub has, in each case
insofar as the Business is concerned:   (i) sold, leased, licensed or
otherwise disposed of any of the  assets of the Business (or entered into any
contract to do any of the  foregoing), except Inventory and obsolete or worn
out equipment sold in  the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice which was  not otherwise material (individually or in the aggregate)
to the  Business or canceled any material indebtedness or waived any
material  claims or rights of material value; or   (ii) changed the
employee compensation and benefits structure  of the Business in a manner
that materially adversely affects the cost  structure of the Business, taken
as a whole.     SECTION 3.16. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. Since
January 1, 2000, Seller, Seller Sub and their affiliates have been, with
respect to the Business, in compliance with all Applicable Laws, except for
instances of noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. None of
Seller and Seller Sub has received any written communication from a
Governmental Entity that alleges that the Business is not in compliance in
any material respect with any Applicable Law. This Section 3.16 does not
relate to        27  matters with respect to Taxes, which are the
subject of Section 3.12, or to environmental matters, which are the subject
of Section 3.17.   SECTION 3.17. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except for any
matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect, (i) Seller, Seller Sub
and their affiliates have been, with respect to the Business, in compliance
with all laws, rules and regulations relating to protection of the
environment ("ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS"), (ii) Seller possesses and is in
compliance with all permits, licenses and authorizations necessary under
Environmental Laws for the operation of the Business and (iii) there are no
pending, or to the knowledge of Seller or Seller Sub, threatened, claims,
proceedings or investigations against Seller or Seller Sub alleging that the
Business is not in compliance with any Environmental Laws.   SECTION 3.18.
TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. Except for the Ancillary Agreements, none of
the Contracts between the Business, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its
affiliates, on the other hand, will continue in effect subsequent to the
Closing, and all such Contracts shall have been terminated with no liability
to Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date.   SECTION 3.19. INVESTMENTS.
Other than shares of capital stock of Seller Sub, there are no partnership
interests or any other equity interests in any corporation, company, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other business
association ("INVESTMENTS") owned by Seller or Seller Sub on the date of this
Agreement that are used, held for use or intended to be used in, or arise out
of, the operation or conduct of the Business.   SECTION 3.20. RECEIVABLES.
As of the date of this Agreement, all the Receivables that are included in
the Acquired Assets (a) represent actual indebtedness or other obligations
incurred by the applicable account debtors and (b) have arisen from bona fide
transactions in the ordinary course of the Business. As of the date of this
Agreement, all the Receivables that are included in the Acquired Assets, to
the knowledge of Seller and Seller Sub, are good and collectible at the
aggregate recorded amounts thereof, net of any applicable reserves for
doubtful accounts reflected on the face of the Balance Sheet or as will be
set forth on the face of the Closing Statement.   SECTION 3.21. NO OTHER
AGREEMENTS. Neither Seller nor Seller Sub has any legal obligation, absolute
or contingent, to any other Person to sell, directly or indirectly, the
Acquired Assets or to sell the Business or to effect any merger, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation
or other reorganization of Seller Sub or to enter into any agreement with
respect thereto.   SECTION 3.22. EMPLOYEES. Schedule 3.22 sets forth
each employee of Seller or Seller Sub whose employment is primarily related
to the operation of the Business on the date of this       
28  Agreement (each a "BUSINESS EMPLOYEE"). There are no employee unions
(nor any other similar labor or employee organizations) under local statutes,
custom or practice with respect to any Continued Employee. Neither Seller nor
Seller Sub has experienced any attempt by organized labor or its
representatives to make Seller or Seller Sub conform to demands of organized
labor relating to a Continued Employee or to enter into a binding agreement
with organized labor that would cover any such employee. With respect to the
Business, there is no labor strike or labor disturbance pending or, to the
best of Seller\'s or Seller Sub\'s knowledge, threatened against Seller or
Seller Sub nor is any grievance currently being asserted, and neither Seller
nor Seller Sub has experienced a work stoppage or other labor difficulty, and
is not and has not engaged in any unfair labor practice.   SECTION 3.23.
INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS. Seller acknowledges that the Holdco Shares issued
pursuant to Section 2.02(b) have not been registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), and may not be resold absent
registration under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from the
registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act and
that the certificates representing the Holdco Shares will bear a restrictive
legend to the foregoing effect. Seller further acknowledges that neither
Holdco nor Purchaser is under any obligation, nor assumes any obligation
pursuant to the terms hereof, or the terms of any other certificate,
instrument or other document executed and delivered by it in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller is acquiring the Holdco Shares
for its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view toward
any resale or other distribution thereof (within the meaning of
the Securities Act). Seller qualifies as an "accredited investor" as that
term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities
Act. Seller has had an opportunity to discuss the business, management,
operations and finances of Holdco and Purchaser with its officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives and affiliates. Seller has conducted its
own independent investigation of Holdco and Purchaser and has been furnished
by Holdco and Purchaser with all information, documents and other material
relating to Holdco and Purchaser and their business, management, operations
and finances, that Seller has requested.    ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS

it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation by
Purchaser of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(a "PURCHASER MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT"). Purchaser has delivered to Seller

and thereby. The execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is specified to be, a party and
the consummation by Purchaser of the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action. No other corporate proceedings on the part of

Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Purchaser
has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and prior to the Closing will
have duly executed and delivered each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or
is specified to be, a party, and this Agreement constitutes, and each
Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be, a party will after
the Closing constitute, its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable

the execution and delivery by Purchaser of each Ancillary Agreement to which
it is, or is specified to be, a party will not, and the consummation of the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and
compliance by Purchaser with the terms hereof and thereof will not conflict
with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries under, any provision of (a) the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries, (b) any Contract to which Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries
is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound
or (c) any Judgment or Applicable Law applicable to Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than, in
the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, any such items that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. No material Consent of or material
registration, declaration or filing with any Governmental Entity is required
to be obtained or made by or with respect to Purchaser or       
30  any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the
consummation of the Acquisition or the other transactions contemplated hereby

outstanding Judgments against Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries, (b)
Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against

have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.05. AVAILABILITY OF
FUNDS. Exhibit B attached hereto sets forth complete and correct copies of a
commitment letter from Toronto Dominion (Texas), Inc. and TD Securities (USA)
(collectively, the "BANK") for the aggregate amount of $220 million in debt
financing (the "FINANCING COMMITMENT"). As of the date of this Agreement, the
Financing Commitment has not been withdrawn or terminated and Purchaser has
no reason to believe that the Financing Commitment will not lead to the
financing as contemplated by the Financing Commitment. The Financing
Commitment, together with equity funds that Purchaser can obtain without the
prior consent, approval or other discretionary action of any third party,
constitute all of the financing required to be provided by Purchaser for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
payments of all fees and expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection
therewith.   SECTION 4.06. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HOLDCO.
Holdco hereby makes the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained
in the first three sentences of Section 4.02 and the first sentence of
Section 4.03 as to itself (with each reference to Purchaser therein being
deemed to be a reference to Holdco). Holdco, as the sole stockholder of
Purchaser, has duly authorized the issuance of the shares of Holdco common
stock for delivery by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to Section 2.06(b)(ii) and
such shares, when issued, will be fully paid, nonassessable and free of all
Liens.          31   ARTICLE V   COVENANTS   SECTION 5.01.

organizational  documents of any entity in which there is an Investment that
is  included in the Acquired Assets;   (xi) not make any new Investment or
make any loan, advance or  capital contribution to any entity, other than any
such Investment,  loan, advance or capital contribution to Seller or any
subsidiary of  Seller;        33   (xii) enter into, extend,
materially modify, terminate or  renew any Contract or Lease that is, or
would be required to be  disclosed, pursuant to Section 3.06(a) or 3.08;  
(xiii) fail to pay accounts payable related to the Business in  the ordinary
course of business or collect accounts receivable related  to the Business in
the ordinary course of business; or   (xiv) authorize any of, or commit or
agree to take, whether in  writing or otherwise, to do any of, the foregoing
actions;   (b) ADVISE OF CHANGES. Seller shall promptly advise Purchaser in
writing of the occurrence of any matter or event that could reasonably
be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect or that would
constitute a breach of any representation or warranty resulting in the
failure of a condition contained in this Agreement.   SECTION 5.02. NO
SOLICITATION. Seller and Seller Sub shall not, nor shall either of them
authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of or any investment
banker, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by either of
them to, (a) solicit, initiate or encourage any "other bid", (b) enter into
any agreement with respect to any other bid or (c) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any other bid. Seller promptly shall
advise Purchaser orally and in writing of any other bid or any inquiry with
respect to or which could lead to any other bid and the identity of the
person making, and the proposed terms of, any such other bid or inquiry. As
used in this Section 5.02, "other bid" shall mean any proposal to acquire in
any manner, or acquisition of, direct or indirect, any Acquired Asset, other
than (A) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) the acquisition
of Inventory in the ordinary course of Business and (C) any Excluded Asset
described in Section 1.02(b).   SECTION 5.03. ACCESS TO INFORMATION. (a)
Seller and Seller Sub shall afford to Purchaser and its employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives and advisors reasonable
access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Closing, to all the personnel, properties, books, contracts,
commitments, data, files, Tax returns and Records of, and relating to, the
Business (other than the Excluded Assets, other than books and records that
are themselves Excluded Assets), and during such period shall furnish
promptly to Purchaser any information concerning the Business, in the
possession or control of Seller and/or Seller Sub as Purchaser may reasonably
request; provided, however, that such access does not unreasonably disrupt
the normal operations of Seller. Subject to Section 6.05, no investigation or
receipt of information by        34  Purchaser shall operate as a
waiver or otherwise affect any representation or warranty of Seller or Sub or
any covenant (including indemnifications) under this Agreement.   (b) After
the Closing, Seller and Seller Sub will give Purchaser and its employees,
counsel, accountants and other representatives and advisors (collectively,
"REPRESENTATIVES") reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to all books, documents, information, data, files and
other records in the possession or control of Seller relating to (i) the
operation of the Business prior to the Closing, (ii) the Acquired Assets or
(iii) the Assumed Liabilities, and to furnish copies thereof, which
Purchaser or its Representatives reasonably request, including in connection
with claims, proceedings, actions, investigations, audits and other
regulatory or legal proceedings involving (x) the operation of the Business
after the Closing, (y) the Acquired Assets or (z) the Assumed Liabilities,
and Seller and Seller Sub shall furnish reasonable assistance (at Seller\'s
expense other than for out-of-pocket costs and expenses, which shall be
reimbursed by Purchaser) (including access to personnel) to Purchaser and its
Representatives in connection with such claims and other proceedings. Seller
and Seller Sub shall not destroy any such records prior to the fifth
anniversary of the Closing, and in any event will not destroy or permit the
destruction of any such records without providing Purchaser with notice
detailing the contents of such records, and providing Purchaser with the
opportunity to obtain such records, at least 60 days prior to the destruction
thereof.   SECTION 5.04. CONFIDENTIALITY. (a) Purchaser acknowledges
that the information being provided to it in connection with the Acquisition
and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby is subject
to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and Seller
(the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), the terms of which are incorporated herein
by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information
relating solely to the Business and the Acquired Assets; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other information provided to it
by Seller or Seller\'s representatives concerning Seller shall remain subject
to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the
Closing Date.   (b) Seller shall keep confidential, and cause its
affiliates and instruct its and their officers, directors, employees and
advisors to keep confidential, all information relating to the Business,
except as required by law or administrative process and except for
information that is available to the public on the Closing Date, or
thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach
of this Section 5.04(b); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that after the issuance of a
press release regarding the Acquisition Seller may discuss with analysts and
investors the actual or anticipated effect of the Acquisition on the
performance of Seller\'s businesses. The covenant set forth in this Section
5.04(b) shall terminate simultaneously with the Directory
Business Agreement.        35   (c) At the Closing, Seller and
Seller Sub shall assign, or cause their financial advisor to assign, to
Purchaser all rights with respect to the Business or the Acquired Assets
under any confidentiality agreements executed by or on behalf of Seller or
Seller Sub in connection with the potential sale of the Business.   SECTION
5.05. REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Closing to occur, including taking all actions reasonably necessary to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any
of its affiliates with respect to the Closing.   (b) Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten
business days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file
with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United
States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the notification and report form, if
any, required for the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental
information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Any
such notification and report form and supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of
Purchaser and Seller shall furnish to the other such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act.
Seller and Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC and the DOJ and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or
request. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) Prior to the Closing,
each party shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all consents, approvals and
waivers from third parties necessary or appropriate to permit the transfer of
the Acquired Assets to, and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by,
Purchaser, and in connection with the debt financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitment, including to provide the Bank a perfected security
interest in certain Contracts; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the parties shall not
be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in
favor of) any person from whom any such consent, approval or waiver may be
required (other than nominal filing or application fees). Seller hereby
consents to the assignment to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement of any
Assigned Contract to which Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller is the other
party (as opposed to the party representing the Business), including those
Assigned Contracts set forth on Schedule 3.08.   (d) Prior to the Closing,
Seller and Seller Sub agree to provide, and will cause their respective
officers and employees to provide, all reasonably necessary cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of any financing to be consummated
contemporaneous with or at or after the Closing,        36  including
participation in meetings, due diligence sessions, the preparation
of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and
similar documents or other requested certificates, documents or opinions
customarily delivered by a seller in connection with comparable financings,
in each case as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser.   (e) Prior to
and at Closing, Purchaser shall take whatever actions are reasonably
necessary to cause the debt financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments to be funded at the Closing and shall cause its affiliates to
provide the guarantees contemplated by the Financing Commitment subject
to all conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement being satisfied.   (f) Each of Seller and Seller Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consents required by Section
6.01(c) within 45 days of the date of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
Seller and Seller Sub shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any
amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any person from whom any such
consent, approval or waiver may be required (other than nominal filing or
application fees).   SECTION 5.06. EXPENSES; TRANSFER TAXES. (a) Whether or
not the Closing takes place, and except as set forth in Section 5.10 and
Article VIII, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense,
including all costs and expenses incurred pursuant to Sections 1.04 and
5.05.   (b) The responsibility for paying all transfer, documentary, sales,
use, registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including
all applicable real estate transfer Taxes) and related fees (including
any penalties, interest and additions to Taxes) incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be borne by
Seller. Each party shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any
available exemptions from any such Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with the
other parties in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such exemptions.   SECTION 5.07. BROKERS OR FINDERS.
Each of Purchaser and Seller represents, as to itself and its affiliates,
that no agent, broker, investment banker or other firm or person is or will
be entitled to any broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any other commission or
similar fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except, as to Seller and its affiliates, Merrill Lynch and Co.,
whose fees and expenses will be paid by Seller.   SECTION 5.08. COLLECTION
OF RECEIVABLES. From and after the Closing, subject to the terms of any
Ancillary Agreement, Purchaser shall have the right and authority to collect
(including to        37  prosecute any claims or proceedings) for its
own account all Receivables and other related items that are included in the
Acquired Assets and to endorse with the name of Seller or Seller Sub, as
applicable, any checks or drafts received with respect to any Receivables or
such other related items. Subject to the terms of any Ancillary Agreement,
Seller and Seller Sub shall promptly deliver to Purchaser any cash or other
property received directly or indirectly by it with respect to the
Receivables and such other related items, including any amounts payable as
interest.   SECTION 5.09. EMPLOYEE MATTERS. (a) CONTINUATION OF EMPLOYMENT;
CREDITED SERVICE. Effective as of the Closing, except with respect to those
Business Employees listed in Schedule 5.09(a), each of whom shall remain in
the employ of the Seller, Seller Sub or an affiliate of Seller or Seller Sub
after the Closing (the "EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES"), Purchaser shall make offers of
employment to each other Business Employee, in a substantially similar and
suitable position with the same salary and hourly wage rate and
incentive bonus opportunities as that provided to the Business Employees
immediately prior to Closing (subject to the provisions of Section 5.09(b)).
For purposes of this Section 5.09, "Business Employees" shall include those
employees who are not actively at work as of the Closing due to disability or
approved leave of absence (including, without limitation, vacation, jury
duty, medical leave, maternity or paternity leave, and military leave) (in
each case referred to as an "INACTIVE EMPLOYEE"); PROVIDED, that Purchaser\'s
obligation to employ any Inactive Employee upon such Inactive Employee\'s
return from disability or other approved leave of absence shall be subject to
Applicable Law. Purchaser shall assume all liabilities relating to its
failure to employ any such employees in the same positions upon such
employees\' ability to return to work in accordance with Applicable Law.
Business Employees who accept Purchaser\'s offer of employment shall be
referred to as "CONTINUED EMPLOYEES". Continued Employees shall receive
credit for all service with Seller, Seller Sub and their affiliates (and
their predecessors) for all purposes under Purchaser\'s employee benefit
plans to the same extent recognized by Seller, Seller Sub and
their affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that such service shall not result in any duplication of benefits or be
credited for benefit accrual purposes under any Purchaser defined benefit
pension plan.   (b) CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS. Notwithstanding Section
5.09(a), nothing contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to impose
on Purchaser any obligation for the continuation of employment of any
Continued Employee for any period of time following the Closing or limitation
on its ability to modify any compensation or benefits provided to any
Continued Employee; PROVIDED, that for not less than one year following the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain, or shall cause to be maintained,
salary and hourly wage rate and incentive bonus opportunities, and severance
benefit plans and arrangements (other than any plans and arrangements based
on equity securities or any equivalent thereof) and perquisites for Continued
Employees that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided
to Continued Employees by Seller prior to Closing.         38   (c)
401(K) PLAN; ROLLOVERS. Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall have in
effect a profit-sharing plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code ("PURCHASER\'S
401(K) PLAN") that will provide benefits to Continued Employees as of the
Closing. Each Continued Employee participating in Seller\'s
Retirement Savings Plan ("SELLER\'S 401(K) PLAN") as of the Closing shall
become a participant in Purchaser\'s 401(k) Plan as of the Closing. At such
time as Seller is reasonably satisfied that Purchaser\'s 401(k) Plan meets
the requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code, Seller
shall permit, subject to its reasonable interpretation of the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Code, each Continued Employee to effect a "direct
rollover" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder) to Purchaser\'s 401(k) Plan of his or her account
balances (including all outstanding loans) in Seller\'s 401(k) Plan if such
rollover is elected in accordance with Applicable Law by such Continued
Employee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Continued
Employee may elect to effect a "direct rollover" to Purchaser\'s 401(k) Plan
of his or her account balances (including all outstanding loans) in Seller\'s
401(k) Plan, and Purchaser agrees to cause Purchaser\'s 401(k) Plan to accept
such rollover provided that Seller provides evidence reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser under Applicable Law that Seller\'s 401(k) Plan meets the
requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code. Purchaser
also agrees to cause Purchaser\'s 401(k) Plan to accept any "direct rollover"
of benefits distributed to a Continued Employee under Seller\'s Pension Plan,
if elected in accordance with Applicable Law by such Continued Employee;
PROVIDED, that Seller provides evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser
under Applicable Law that Seller\'s Pension Plan meets the requirements for
qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code.   (d) STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION. Seller shall retain liability for all grants of rights to
purchase Seller\'s common stock as well as grants of restricted stock,
restricted units and any other equity or equity-based awards under the
equity-based plans and programs of Seller, Seller Sub and their affiliates
that were granted prior to the Closing to employees of the Business in
accordance with the terms of the plans and programs under which such
grants were made.   (e) WELFARE BENEFIT PLANS. (i) At or prior to the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or designate welfare benefit plans
and arrangements (including, without limitation, plans and arrangements
providing medical, dental, life, and disability insurance coverages) to
provide benefits to Continued Employees and their dependents ("PURCHASER
WELFARE PLANS"). As of the Closing Date, Continued Employees and their
dependents shall commence participation (without any waiting time) in
Purchaser Welfare Plans and shall cease participating in any corresponding
welfare benefit plan maintained by Seller or its affiliates. Seller shall
retain sole liability for all claims incurred under the Seller Benefit Plans
that are welfare benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA
("SELLER WELFARE PLANS") incurred at or prior to the Closing. Reimbursement
of expenses associated with such claims shall be determined in accordance
with the terms of Seller Welfare Plans as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing. Claims under any medical, dental, vision, or prescription drug plan
generally will        39  be deemed to be incurred on the date that
the service giving rise to such claim is performed and not when such claim is
made; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with respect to claims relating to a hospital
stay that commences prior to the Closing and ends following the Closing, the
cost thereof shall be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser, with Seller
responsible for that portion of the cost incurred prior to the Closing and
Purchaser responsible for the balance of such cost. Claims for disability
under any long or short term disability plan will be deemed to be incurred on
the date the illness or injury is certified to have occurred.   (ii) Seller
shall provide any continuation coverage required  under Section 4980B of the
Code, Part 6 of Title 1 of ERISA or  applicable state law ("COBRA") to each
"qualified beneficiary" as that  term is defined in COBRA whose first
"qualifying event" (as defined in  COBRA) occurs on or prior to the Closing
Date.   (iii) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days  to
which each Continued Employee shall be entitled, Purchaser shall  assume and
honor all vacation days accrued but not yet taken by  Continued Employees as
of the Closing. To the extent that a Continued  Employee is entitled to be
paid for any vacation days, Purchaser shall  discharge the liability for such
vacation days.   (iv) Seller and Purchaser intend that the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute a severance of 
employment of any Continued Employee prior to or upon the consummation  of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and that such employees will  have
continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before and  immediately
after the Closing. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold  harmless Seller and
its affiliates, and each of their respective  officers, directors and
employees, from all costs, expenses or other  damages that may result in
respect of claims made by any Continued  Employee for severance or other
separation benefits arising out of or  in connection with Purchaser\'s
employment of, Purchaser\'s failure to  offer employment to, or Purchaser\'s
termination of employment of, any  Continued Employee not in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.   (v) Seller and/or one or more of its
affiliates currently  sponsor a program that provides workers compensation
benefits for  eligible Continued Employees. Seller shall be responsible for
any  claims made with respect to Business Employees or former Business 
Employee for workers\' compensation or similar claims whether or not  insured
or self-insured or mandated by applicable Law ("COMPENSATION  CLAIMS") filed
with an appropriate agency by a Business Employee,  former Business Employee
or a spouse or dependent of a Business  Employee or former Business Employee
("CLAIMING EMPLOYEE") if the  injury or alleged injury occurred, or was
alleged to have occurred, in  its entirety prior to the Closing Date,
irrespective of when such  injury is manifested. Purchaser shall be
responsible for any  Compensation Claim filed on or        40  
after the Closing Date if the injury or alleged injury occurred, or was 
alleged to have occurred in its entirety after the Closing Date. In the 
event a Compensation Claim is filed after the Closing Date by or on  behalf
of a Claiming Employee and the injury occurred or is alleged to  have
occurred prior to and subsequent to the Closing Date, the  liability for such
Compensation Claim, if any, as between Seller and  Purchaser shall be
equitably apportioned between them based upon the  length of exposure of the
Claiming Employee to the product, material,  practice, condition or other
circumstances claimed to have caused the  alleged injury, preceding and
following the Closing.   (f) CAFETERIA PLAN. Purchaser shall have in effect
as of the Closing flexible spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria
plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code which provide benefits to
Continued Employees and former employees of the Business (other than Excluded
Employees) substantially comparable in all material respects to those
provided by the flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the cafeteria
plan portion of the Seller\'s Flexible Benefit Plan, Flex Medical Plan and
Flex Dental Plan (collectively, the "SELLER\'S CAFETERIA PLANS") and
Purchaser agrees to cause such plan to accept a spin-off of the accounts from
Seller\'s Cafeteria Plans and to honor and continue through the end of the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs the elections made by Continued
Employees under such plan which are in effect immediately prior to the
Closing. Purchaser shall assume sole liability for reimbursements under such
flexible spending accounts in respect of all claims incurred during the year
in which the Closing occurs by Continued Employees and former employees of
the Business (other than Excluded Employees), whether incurred prior to, on
or after the Closing Date, that have not been paid in full as of the Closing
Date. Promptly following the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer to Purchaser
the excess, as of the Closing Date, of the accumulated payroll deductions for
such calendar year allocated to such accounts by the Continued Employees and
former employees of the Business (other than Excluded Employees) over the
payouts made for such calendar year from such accounts to such employees.  
(g) ADMINISTRATION. Following the date of this Agreement through the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate fully
in all matters reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated
by this Section 5.09, including exchanging information and data relating to
workers compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverages,
and in obtaining any governmental approvals required hereunder.   SECTION
5.10. POST-CLOSING COOPERATION. (a) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with
each other, and shall cause their officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives to cooperate with each other, for a period of 120 days (or
such longer period as required by Section 5.09) after the Closing to ensure
the orderly transition of the Business from Seller to Purchaser and to
minimize any disruption to the Business and the other respective businesses
of Seller and Purchaser that might result from the transactions contemplated
hereby. After the Closing, upon reasonable written        41  notice,
Purchaser and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and
their employees, counsel, auditors and representatives access, during normal
business hours, to such information and assistance relating to the Business
(to the extent within the control of such party) as is reasonably necessary
for financial reporting and accounting matters. Seller and Seller Sub shall
permit Purchaser to continue to use leased personal property
primarily related to the Business that is currently leased by Seller pursuant
to a lease agreement, which lease is not being assigned to Purchaser pursuant
to this Agreement.   (b) Each party shall reimburse the other for
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting the other
pursuant to this Section 5.10 and Section 5.24 (which costs and expenses
shall not include the salaries or benefits of employees). Neither party shall
be required by this Section 5.10 or Section 5.24 to take any action that
would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or unreasonably
disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case of Purchaser, the
Business).   SECTION 5.11. PUBLICITY. From the date of this
Agreement through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party
without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be
required by law or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
each of Seller, Seller Sub and Purchaser may make internal announcements to
their respective employees that are consistent with the parties\' prior
public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated hereby after
reasonable prior notice to and consultation with the other. Seller and
Purchaser shall have agreed prior to the date of this Agreement on a form of
initial press announcement to be used in announcing the execution of this
Agreement.   SECTION 5.12. NO SOLICITATION; EXCLUSIVE AGENCY. (a)
Seller and Seller Sub, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand,
agree that from the date hereof until the third anniversary of the Closing,
neither of them nor any of their respective affiliates shall solicit the
employment of, in the case of Seller and Seller Sub, any Continued Employee
or, in the case of Purchaser, any employee of Seller or Seller Sub on the
date of this Agreement (other than the Continued Employees). This Section
5.12 shall not be interpreted to prohibit solicitations of employment through
general advertising not specifically directed at the employees of the other
party.   (b) From and after the termination of the Directory
Business Agreement through the 20th anniversary of the Closing Date, in the
event that Seller or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates engages to any
extent in activities which constitute all or a portion of the Business as
conducted by Seller and Seller Sub immediately prior to Closing, such entity
will do so only for the sole benefit of        42  Purchaser. All
revenue received by such entity from the operation of such Business will be
collected by such entity for the account of Purchaser and such entity will
retain 15% of such revenue and Seller will (and will cause its parent,
subsidiary and affiliates to) pay to Purchaser 85% of such revenue.
Such payment shall be made within 10 days after receipt of such revenue.
Purchaser shall be required, subject to Aplicable Law, to accept for
publication any advertising sold by such entity in the operation of such
Business. The obligations and commitments set forth in this Section 5.12(b)
shall terminate upon the termination of the License Agreement pursuant to
Section 4.3 thereof.   SECTION 5.13. MONTHLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION. Prior to
the Closing, promptly after each month-end occurring after the date hereof,
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser such financial reports or other summary
information with respect to the Business for the month ended on such month-
end as Seller has generated for its own internal financial and accounting
purposes the ordinary course of its business consistent with past
practice.   SECTION 5.14. RECORDS. Purchaser recognizes that
certain Records may contain incidental information relating primarily to
subsidiaries or divisions of Seller other than the Business and that Seller
may retain copies of the relevant portions thereof.   SECTION 5.15. BULK
TRANSFER LAWS. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller and Seller Sub
with the provisions of any so-called "bulk transfer law" of any jurisdiction
in connection with the sale of the Acquired Assets to Purchaser.   SECTION
5.16. FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party, each party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such further or other actions, as such other party may reasonably
deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, in the case of Seller and Seller Sub, executing
and delivering to Purchaser such assignments, deeds, bills of sale, consents
and other instruments as Purchaser or its counsel may reasonably request as
necessary or desirable for such purpose.   SECTION 5.17. PURCHASE PRICE
ALLOCATION. Seller, Seller Sub and Purchaser mutually agree to allocate the
Purchase Price (plus Assumed Liabilities to the extent properly taken into
account under the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder)
among the Acquired Assets according to the relative fair market values of
such assets as of the Closing Date in accordance with the provisions of
Section 1060 of the Code (and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder). Purchaser shall provide Seller with a draft of such allocation
on the Closing Date. Seller shall notify Purchaser of any objection Seller
may have to such allocation within fifteen (15) days of its receipt of such
allocation. Seller and Purchaser shall resolve any disagreement with respect
to such allocation in good faith consistent herewith; provided, however, that
if Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on        43  such
allocation within thirty (30) days after Purchaser notifies Seller of
any objections to the draft allocation, Seller and Purchaser shall promptly
elect an independent appraisal firm to determine such allocation. The
conclusions of such appraisal firm shall be conclusive and binding. The fees
and expenses of such appraisal firm shall be shared equally by Seller and
Purchaser. Seller, Seller Sub and Purchaser agree to (i) be bound by the
allocation of the Purchase Price (as agreed upon or, if applicable, as
determined by appraisal), (ii) act in accordance with such allocation in the
filing of all Tax Returns (including, without limitation, filing Form 8594
with their United States federal income Tax Return for the taxable year that
includes the date of the Closing (and any amendments to such form)) and in
the course of any Tax audit, Tax review or Tax litigation relating thereto
and (iii) take no position and cause their affiliates to take no position
inconsistent with such allocation for income Tax purposes, including United
States federal and state income Tax, unless, in each case, otherwise required
by a "DETERMINATION" as defined in Section 1313 of the Code or by similar
applicable state Tax law. Seller, Seller Sub and Purchaser shall cooperate in
the filing of their respective Forms 8594 (and any amendments thereto)
relating to this transaction, and not later than 30 days prior to the filing
of such Forms 8594 relating to this transaction (and any amendments thereto),
each party shall deliver to the other party a copy of its Form 8594 (or
amendment, as applicable).   SECTION 5.18. COOPERATION; ALLOCATION OF TAXES
AMONG ACQUIRED ASSETS.   (a) Purchaser and each of Seller and Seller Sub
agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon request, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, reasonable information and assistance
relating to the Acquired Assets or the Business, including, without
limitation, access to books and records, in connection with the filing of all
Tax Returns by Purchaser or Seller or Seller Sub, the making of any election
relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, the
obtaining of clearance certificates or similar documents from state Taxing
Authorities relating to relief from Taxes that might otherwise be imposed in
respect of the Acquisition, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit
or proceeding relating to any Tax. Purchaser and each of Seller and Seller
Sub shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit,
litigation or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Acquired
Assets.   (b) Seller shall be responsible for and shall promptly pay when
due all Taxes levied with respect to the Acquired Assets attributable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall promptly
pay when due all Taxes levied with respect to the Acquired
Assets attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. Such Taxes for any
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Purchaser and Seller based on
the number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Period
and the number of days of such taxable period included in the Post-Closing
Tax Period. Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes
that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Purchaser shall be
liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the
Post-Closing Tax Period. Upon receipt of any bill for such Taxes, Purchaser
or        44  Seller shall present a statement to the other setting
forth the amount of reimbursement, if any, to which each is entitled under
this Section 5.18(b) together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably
necessary to calculate the proration amount. The proration amount shall be
paid by the party owing it to the other within ten (10) days after delivery
of such statement.   SECTION 5.19. REFUNDS. Seller shall be entitled to any
refunds or credits of Taxes levied with respect to the Acquired Assets
allocable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser shall be entitled to any
refunds or credits of Taxes levied with respect to the Acquired Assets
allocable to any Post-Closing Tax Period. Refunds or credits of any such
Taxes for any Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and Post-Closing Tax Period within such Straddle Period in the
same manner as such Tax with respect to such Straddle Period was apportioned
pursuant to Section 5.18(b). Upon Purchaser\'s or Seller\'s receipt of any
refund or credit of such Taxes, if the other party is entitled to any part of
such refund or credit hereunder, the party receiving such refund or credit
shall present a statement to the other setting forth the amount of the refund
or credit to which each is entitled under this Section 5.19 together with
such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the
proration amount. The proration amount shall be paid by the party owing it to
the other within ten (10) days after delivery of such statement.   SECTION
5.20. SELLER AND SELLER SUB TRANSFERS. Seller and Seller Sub shall cause to
be transferred to Seller or Seller Sub all right, title and interest in all
assets, if any, held by an affiliate of Seller (other than Seller Sub) that

related to directories, yellow, white, pink, blue or any color pages, lists
or any other name or mark that has such a near resemblance to Seller Sub\'s
current name or that is descriptive of the Business as may be likely to cause
confusion or mistake to the public with respect to the ownership and
operation of the Business. Such amendment shall be in a form acceptable for
filing with the Secretary of State of Ohio.   SECTION 5.23. ADVERTISING
SERVICES. From the Closing Date through the fifth anniversary of the Closing

advertising        45  services at then effective rates aggregating
at least $350,000 for each full calendar year and (ii) refrain from
purchasing telephone directory advertising from any competitor of the
Business within the geographic scope set forth in the Directory Business
Agreement. In connection with such purchase, Purchaser will provide to Seller
advertising having a value of $1,050,000 at then effective rates at no

Seller and Seller Sub agree to provide assistance to Purchaser with the goal
of enabling Purchaser to operate independently of Seller and Seller Sub
following the Closing, subject to the Service Agreements, including with
respect to cash management, personnel and employee benefits, information
systems and internet access. Seller and Seller Sub acknowledge that there may
be additional services which have not been identified in this Agreement or in
the Ancillary Agreements but which have been used by the Business prior to
the Closing Date and which shall continue to be required or desired by
Purchaser after the Closing in connection with the operation of the Business.
If any such additional services are identified and requested by Purchaser,
Seller and Seller Sub agree to negotiate in good faith with Purchaser to
provide such services.   (b) Subject to such terms and conditions to be
mutually agreed between the parties as soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, Seller agrees to cause each Excluded Employee, while
employed by Seller or Seller Sub, to be made available following the Closing
Date, for a reasonable period of time, to perform for the benefit of
Purchaser the usual and customary functions and services that were performed

Date, and Purchaser shall pay a fee to Seller in consideration thereof to
reimburse Seller and Seller Sub for any direct payroll costs and out-of-

course of such Excluded Employee\'s performance of his or her duties for the
Purchaser and paid or reimbursed by Seller or Seller Sub, as reasonably
determined by Seller or Seller Sub in the ordinary course of business and
using its usual methods of cost accounting.    ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS

by any other party of its obligations under this Agreement.   SECTION 7.03.
AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. By an

and expenses) ("LOSSES"), as incurred (payable promptly upon written
request), resulting from or arising out of:   (i) any breach of any

cumulative  basis an amount equal to $1,500,000, and then only to the 
extent of any such excess;         51   (ii) under clause (i) of

interest or  rights or options to obtain an equity interest in Purchaser or 
its affiliates).   (c) Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges that its
sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to any and all
claims relating to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the
Business and its assets and liabilities (other than claims of, or causes of
action arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Purchaser hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) it may
have against Seller or Seller Sub arising under or based upon this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection
herewith, any Applicable Law (including any relating to environmental
matters), common law or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Section 8.01).   SECTION 8.02. INDEMNIFICATION
BY PURCHASER. (a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify
Seller, Seller Sub, their affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives against, and
agrees to hold them harmless from, any Loss, as incurred (payable promptly
upon written request), for or on account of or arising from or in connection
with or otherwise with respect to (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Agreement or the certificate delivered at Closing by Purchaser in connection
therewith, (ii) any breach of any covenant of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, (iii) any Assumed Liability,

or in connection with Purchaser\'s employment of, Purchaser\'s failure to

52   (b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or in
any Ancillary Agreement, Seller and Seller Sub acknowledge that their sole
and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to any and all claims
relating to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the Acquisition and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the Business and
its assets and liabilities (other than claims of, or causes of action arising
from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller and Seller Sub
hereby waive, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) it may have
against Purchaser arising under or based upon this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any
Applicable Law (including any relating to environmental matters), common law
or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Section 8.02).   SECTION 8.03. CALCULATION OF LOSSES. The amount of
any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII shall
be net of any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under
insurance policies with respect to such Loss and shall be (a) increased to
take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the indemnified party arising
from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such
increase) and (b) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit realized by
the indemnified party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
Loss. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the
indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income,
gain, loss deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the
receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of
any indemnified Loss. The amount of the Loss arising out of any item included
as a liability in calculating Closing Working Capital shall be calculated net
of the amount so included. The amount of the Loss arising out of any
reduction in value of any Current Asset acquired at the Closing shall be
calculated net of the reported value of such Current Asset used in
calculating Closing Working Capital. Losses shall not be limited to
matters asserted by third parties, but includes Losses incurred or sustained
by an indemnified party (as defined below) in the absence of third party
claims. Payments by an indemnified party of amounts for which such
indemnified party is indemnified hereunder shall not be a condition precedent
for recovery under this Article VIII; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if an
indemnified party subsequently is paid any portion of such amounts by a third
party, that any such portion (net of reasonable costs incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with obtaining such amount) shall be paid to
the indemnifying party.   SECTION 8.04. TERMINATION OF INDEMNIFICATION. The
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any party (a) pursuant to Section
8.01(a)(i) or 8.02(a), shall terminate when the applicable representation or
warranty terminates pursuant to Section 8.06 and (b) pursuant to the other
clauses of Sections 8.01 and 8.02 shall not terminate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which the person to be       
53  indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable
period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating
in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) pursuant to Section 8.05 to the
party to be providing the indemnification.   SECTION 8.05. PROCEDURES. (a)
THIRD-PARTY CLAIM. In order for a person (the "indemnified party"), to be
entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made
by any person other than a party hereto against the indemnified party (a
"THIRD-PARTY CLAIM"), such indemnified party must notify the party against
which indemnity is being sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing (and in
reasonable detail) of the Third-Party Claim within 20 business days after
receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the Third-Party Claim;
provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect
the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying
party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying
party, within five business days after the indemnified party\'s receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third-Party Claim;
provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect
the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying
party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.   (b) ASSUMPTION. If a Third-Party Claim is made against
an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate
in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses and acknowledges its obligation
to fully indemnify, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such counsel is not
reasonably objected to by the indemnified party. Should the indemnifying
party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying
party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified
party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall
control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during
which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the
named parties to a Third-Party Claim include both the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party and the indemnified party have been advised by counsel
that there is a conflict of interest requiring the indemnified party to have
separate counsel, the indemnifying party shall be liable for all reasonable
fees and expenses of one such separate counsel for all indemnified parties in
connection with that Third-Party Claim. The indemnifying party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one local counsel, if
required. If the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-
Party Claim, all the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the indemnifying party\'s request) the provision to the       
54  indemnifying party of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without the indemnifying party\'s prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a
Third-Party Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its
terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the
liability in connection with such Third-Party Claim, which releases the
indemnified party completely in connection with such Third-Party Claim. If
any Third-Party Claim seeks injunctive relief against an indemnified party
and such relief would reasonably be likely to have an adverse effect on such
indemnified party\'s business operations, then notwithstanding the foregoing,
the indemnified party shall be entitled to control the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, including to retain counsel, at the indemnifying party\'s cost
and expense, so long as the indemnifying party has the right to consult
and participate in such defense.     53    (c) OTHER CLAIMS. In the
event any indemnified party should have a claim against any indemnifying
party under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements that does not involve
a Third-Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from
such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such
claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. Subject to
Sections 8.04 and 8.06, the failure by any indemnified party so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any
liability that it may have to such indemnified party under this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
demonstrates that it has been actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party
within 30 calendar days following its receipt of such notice that the
indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under
Section 8.01 or 8.02, such claim specified by the indemnified party in such
notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying
party under Section 8.01 or 8.02 and the indemnifying party shall pay the
amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case
of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion
thereof) becomes finally determined.   (d) MITIGATION. Purchaser and Seller
shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or
liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other
party hereunder, including by making reasonable efforts to mitigate or
resolve any such claim or liability.   SECTION 8.06. SURVIVAL OF
REPRESENTATIONS. The representations, warranties contained in this Agreement
and in any document delivered in connection herewith (except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.02, 3.05(a), 3.12,
3.17 and 4.02) shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of Article VIII
and shall terminate at the close of business two years following the Closing
Date. The representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.02, 3.05(a)
and 4.02 shall remain in full force and effect without regard to time. The
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.12 shall remain in full
force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations plus ninety (90) days with respect to the matters addressed in
such sections. The representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.17

or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
