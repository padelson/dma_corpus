Adjustment Amount (it being understood that the Closing Earnings Adjustment
Amount shall not be subject to negotiation, adjustment or modification absent
manifest error), the Capital Stock Payments Amount, the Company Transaction
Expenses Amount and the Affiliate Agreement Payments Amount. If the Acquiror
and the Sellers' Representative resolve their differences, then, upon their
agreement in writing setting forth such resolution, the Estimated Purchase
Price Statement, as amended to the extent necessary to reflect the resolution
of their differences pursuant to this Section 2.05 and, if applicable, Section

binding and non-appealable.

(b) If the Acquiror and the Sellers' Representative are unable to agree upon
the Purchase Price during the Negotiation Period, then they shall refer their
remaining differences to the dispute resolution department of KPMG LLP or such
other independent accounting firm as the Acquiror and the Sellers'
Representative shall agree (the "Independent Accounting Firm") within a
reasonable period of time but no later than thirty (30) days thereafter, which
Independent Accounting Firm shall determine the Purchase Price; provided,

agree on an accounting firm within the timeframe set forth in this clause,
either the Acquiror or the Seller's Representative may request that the
American Arbitration Association's International Centre for Dispute Resolution
appoint as the Independent Accounting Firm, within ten (10) days from the date
of such request or as soon as practicable thereafter, an internationally
recognized accounting firm that is impartial and not the auditor or
independent accounting firm of any of the parties hereto. The Acquiror and the
Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to
deliver its written determination to the Acquiror and the Sellers'
Representative no later than the forty-fifth (45th) day following the date on
which the remaining differences are referred to the Independent Accounting
Firm or such other date as may be mutually agreed to by the Acquiror and the
Sellers' Representative, which written determination shall (i) be in
accordance with this Agreement, (ii) be based solely on presentations and
written submissions by the Sellers' Representative and the Acquiror to the
Independent Accounting Firm, and not by independent review, which
presentations and written submissions shall include the Sellers' and the
Acquiror's respective positions as to the Purchase Price, (iii) set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the Independent Accounting Firm's final
determination of the Purchase Price and (iv) absent manifest error, be final,
conclusive, non-appealable and binding on the parties. In determining each
disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to such
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either the
Acquiror or the Sellers' Representative or less than the lowest value for such
item claimed by either the Acquiror or the Sellers' Representative. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the
Acquiror, on the one hand, and the Sellers (in proportion to each Seller's
ownership



16



of the Shares immediately prior to the Closing), on the other hand, in
proportion to the ratio represented by: (x) the absolute value of the
difference between such party's position as to the Purchase Price as delivered
to the Independent Accounting Firm and the Purchase Price as determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm to (y) the absolute value of the difference
between such party's position as to the Purchase Price and the other party's
position to the Purchase Price. The Acquiror and the Sellers' Representative
shall make available to the Independent Accounting Firm and to each other all
relevant books and records and working papers (including access to personnel
at the Company, the Acquiror and the Sellers who prepared the Estimated
Purchase Price Statement) and all other items reasonably requested by the
Independent Accounting Firm; provided, however, that neither the Sellers nor
the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary shall be obligated to disclose, or
to be caused to be disclosed, to such Independent Accounting Firm or each
other any work papers of its auditors or independent accountants pursuant to
this Section 2.05(b) unless and until such Independent Accounting Firm or
other party, as applicable, has signed a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to working papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such auditors or independent accountants. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert, not an
arbitrator, and its written determination shall be subject to and governed by
Article 76 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, or such other
provision of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules as may from time to
time so apply.

Sellers' Representative



21



shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or

a majority of the outstanding Shares immediately prior to the Closing (if such
death, incapacity or resignation occurs on or after the Closing Date). The
Sellers appointing such substitute representative pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the appointment of
such substitute representative pursuant to this Section 2.09(d), inform in
writing the Acquiror, the Escrow Agent and the Seller Expenses Escrow Agent of
such appointment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
any resignation by the Sellers' Representative shall not become effective

this Section 2.09(d) and notice of such appointment has been provided to the
Acquiror, the Escrow Agent and the Seller Expenses Escrow Agent.

hereto receiving such payment.

Section 2.11. Withholding Taxes. The payment of any amount specified in this
Agreement shall be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or
withholding on account of, any Tax, except as required by Law. The Sellers
shall provide any statements, forms or other documents reasonably requested by
the Acquiror or its Affiliates to reduce or eliminate such deduction or
withholding (including an applicable IRS Form W-8 or W-9). The Acquiror and
the Sellers believe that if such forms, and the certificate described in
Section 2.08(d)(iii), are provided, the payment of the Purchase Price (and
adjustments thereto) shall not be subject to deduction or withholding on
account of any Tax. If any amount payable under this Agreement is required by
Law to be deducted or withheld on account of any Tax, the payor shall promptly



22



remit such amount to the relevant Tax Authority and such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the payee.

sales, use, documentary, registration, stamp, stock transfer, notarial,
filing, recording, authorization and other similar Taxes ("Transfer Taxes"),
if any, imposed on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
borne by the Company and, if applicable, allocated as Company Transaction
Expenses, and the Company shall reimburse the Sellers or the Acquiror, as the
case may be, for any Transfer Taxes paid directly by the Sellers or the
Acquiror, respectively, in connection with this Agreement.

Transferred Subsidiary (as applicable) that is party thereto and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, each other party to such
Material Contract, except for such failures to be valid and binding as,



31



individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such Material Contract is enforceable
against the Company or the Transferred Subsidiary (as applicable) that is
party thereto and, to the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof,
each other party to such Material Contract in accordance with its terms
(subject in each case to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), except for such

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the
Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
as of the date hereof, any other party to a Material Contract, is in default
or breach of a Material Contract and, to the Knowledge of the Company, as of

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the
date hereof, the Company has made available to the Acquiror a true and
complete copy of each Material Contract (including any amendments,

its terms and with applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, except for
any non-compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be

None of the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan that would subject the Company or
any Transferred Subsidiary or any Benefit Plan to a Tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which
could be material to the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Each Benefit Plan, which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, no event has occurred and no condition exists that would
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of such determination
letter.

defined in ERISA. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate which has not been satisfied in full and no
event has occurred and no condition exists that would reasonably be expected
to result in the Company or any ERISA Affiliate incurring a material liability
under Title IV of ERISA. No Benefit Plan is, or is expected to be, in "at-

(d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder or other
approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement could, either alone or in combination with
another event, (i) entitle any employee, independent contractor or consultant
to any payment or benefit (including severance pay or any material increase in
severance pay (other than severance pay required by any applicable Law)), (ii)
directly or indirectly cause the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary to
transfer or set aside any assets to fund any material benefits under any
Benefit Plan, (iii) otherwise give rise to any material liability under any
Benefit Plan, (iv) result in the payment of any amount that could,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, constitute an

for retiree welfare benefits other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable

Section 4.14. Ceded Reinsurance. Section 4.14 of the Company Disclosure

states in which such Insurance Subsidiary operates, or any fronting
arrangements, in each case, under which any material obligations remain
outstanding. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, none of the Insurance
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company and as of the date hereof,
any of the other parties thereto, is in default under any such Third Party
Reinsurance Contract. Since January 1, 2012 until the date hereof, neither the

Contracts, was duly licensed as required by applicable insurance Law (for the
type of business written, sold, produced or marketed on behalf of the
applicable Insurance Subsidiary), except for such failures to be so licensed
which have been cured, which have been resolved or settled through agreements
with applicable Governmental Authorities, which are barred by an applicable
statute of limitations or which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No Producer,
nor any Affiliate of any Producer, has any right to receive any payment based
on the profitability or financial performance of any of the Insurance

the Insurance Subsidiaries, including (i) all applicable Laws relating to the
disclosure of the nature of insurance products as policies of insurance and

of limitations or which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

"Leased Real Property"). A true and complete copy of the Real Property Lease
(including all amendments, modifications and supplements thereto) has been
made available to the Acquiror prior to the date hereof. The Transferred
Subsidiary that is the lessee with respect to the Real Property Lease has a
valid and enforceable leasehold interest under such Real Property Lease,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and, as of the date hereof,
neither the Company nor such Transferred Subsidiary has received any written
notice of any default under the Real Property Lease, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred and no condition exists that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under the Real Property
Lease, except, in each case, for such invalidity, unenforceability or defaults
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.19. Taxes.

(a) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the

privilege to be lost. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6.02(b) and this
Section 6.02(c) shall not apply to any Third Party Claim.

Section 6.03. Books and Records. Subject to Section 6.04(b), the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates shall have the right to retain copies of all
books, data, files, information and records in any media (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Tax Returns and other information and documents relating
to Tax matters) of each of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries and
their respective businesses relating to periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (i) as required by any legal or regulatory authority, including
any applicable Law or regulatory request or (ii) as is reasonably necessary
for the Sellers and their respective Affiliates to perform their respective
obligations pursuant to this Agreement, in each case subject to compliance
with all applicable privacy Laws; provided, however, that the Sellers shall
not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, utilize such books and records
for any purposes other than the permitted purposes set forth in this Section
6.03 or Section 6.02(b). From and after the Closing Date, with respect to all
original books, data, files, information and records of each of the Company
and the Transferred Subsidiaries existing as of the Closing Date, the Acquiror
shall, and shall cause each of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries
to, (A) comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws, including
the Code, relating to the preservation and retention of records, (B) apply
preservation and retention policies that are no less stringent than those
generally applied by the Acquiror and (C) for the longer of six (6) years
after the Closing Date and the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations for Tax purposes (but only to the extent notice is received from
the Sellers within six (6) years of the Closing Date of a longer applicable
statute of limitations or extension thereof), preserve and retain all such
original books, data, files, information and records.

Section 6.04. Confidentiality.

(a) The terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated March 14, 2014 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), between the Company and Parent are incorporated
into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing, at which time the confidentiality obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If, for any reason, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

(b) From and after the Closing, (x) the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, maintain in confidence any
written, oral or other information relating to the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary or relating to or obtained from the Acquiror or its Affiliates and
(y) the Acquiror shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates and
Representatives to, maintain in confidence any written, oral or other
information relating to or obtained from the Sellers, except that the
foregoing requirements of each party hereto contained in this Section 6.04(b)
shall not apply to the extent that (i) any such information is or becomes
generally available to the public other than (A) in the case of the Acquiror,
as a result of disclosure by any Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of its
Representatives in violation of this Section 6.04(b) and (B) in the case of
the Sellers, as a result of disclosure by the Acquiror, the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary (after the Closing Date) or any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives in violation of this
Section 6.04(b) or the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) any such information is
required by applicable Law,



49



Governmental Order or a Governmental Authority to be disclosed; provided that,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Governmental Order or such
Governmental Authority, the disclosing party shall (A) give prior notice of
such required disclosure to the other party as soon as practicable, (B)
cooperate with the other party to preserve the confidentiality of such
information consistent with the requirements of such applicable Law,
Governmental Order or such Governmental Authority, and (C) use reasonable best
efforts to limit any such disclosure to the minimum disclosure required by
applicable Law, Governmental Order or such Governmental Authority, (iii) any
such information is reasonably necessary to be disclosed in connection with
any Action or in any dispute with respect to this Agreement (including in
response to any summons, subpoena or other legal process or formal or informal
investigative demand issued to the disclosing party in the course of any
litigation, arbitration, mediation, investigation or administrative
proceeding) or (iv) any such information was or becomes available to such
party on a non-confidential basis and from a source (other than a party hereto
or any Affiliate or Representative of such party) that was not bound by a
confidentiality agreement with respect to such information at the time of
receipt by such source. From and after the Closing, information relating to
the Company, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or the Business but not
relating to the Sellers shall no longer be confidential information of the
Sellers, and the Acquiror and its Affiliates shall not be restricted from
disclosing any such information by virtue of this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto shall instruct its Affiliates and Representatives having access
to such information of such obligation of confidentiality; provided, however,
that the parties hereto may disclose information about the Tax treatment and
Tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
any facts or materials relating thereto or reasonably necessary to understand
such treatment or structure).

Section 6.05. Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) The Sellers, the Company and the Acquiror shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities
that may be or may become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Sellers, the Company and
the Acquiror shall take all actions as may be requested by any such
Governmental Authorities to obtain such authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals. The Sellers, the Company and the Acquiror shall cooperate with the
reasonable requests of each other in seeking to obtain as promptly as
practicable all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. None of
the Sellers, the Company nor the Acquiror shall take or cause to be taken any
action that they are aware or should reasonably be aware would have the effect
of materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any such required
authorizations, consents, orders or approvals.

(b) The Sellers, the Company and the Acquiror shall promptly make (which shall
in no event be later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof)
all filings and notifications with all Governmental Authorities that may be or
may become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including (i) the Acquiror causing "Form A" or similar
change of control applications to be filed with the State of New



50



Hampshire with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) the Acquiror causing "Form E" or similar market share notifications to be
filed in each jurisdiction where required by applicable insurance Laws, (iii)
the Company and the Acquiror each making an appropriate filing of a
notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act (which filing, including
the exhibits thereto, need not be shared or otherwise disclosed to the other
party) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iv) the Company and the Acquiror each making any other filing that may be
required under any other antitrust or competition Law or by any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or
competition Laws. The Sellers, the Company and the Acquiror each shall supply
promptly to any Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested by such Governmental Authorities of
them pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Laws. The Acquiror shall
have responsibility for the filing fees associated with its HSR Act filing,
its "Form A" or similar change of control applications and its "Form E" or
similar market share notifications, and the Sellers, the Company and the
Acquiror shall have responsibility for their other respective filing fees
associated with any other required filings.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant to this Section
6.05, each of the Sellers, the Company and the Acquiror shall take or cause to
be taken the following actions: (i) the prompt provision to a Governmental
Authority of non-privileged information, documents or testimony requested by
such Governmental Authority that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the
prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or
other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) the prompt use of its
reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that any permanent, preliminary
or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree is
entered or issued or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued,
in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
and all steps (including the appeal thereof or the posting of a bond)
necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or
remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order,
judgment, determination or decree so as to permit such consummation on a
schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing
in this Section 6.05(c) shall obligate the Acquiror, the Sellers, the Company
or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries to agree to any divestitures or other
remedy not conditioned on the consummation of the Closing.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, each of
the Sellers, the Company and the Acquiror shall promptly notify each other of
any communication it receives from any Governmental Authority and permit the
other party to review in advance any proposed non-routine communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority and shall provide each other with
copies of all non-routine correspondence, filings or



51



communications between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of the staff of any
Governmental Authority, on the other hand, in each case to the extent relating
to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and subject to Section
6.02(c). Other than to provide factual routine information during any
telephone communication initiated by a Governmental Authority, none of the
Sellers, the Company or the Acquiror shall participate in any meeting or
conference call with any Governmental Authority, or submit any request to
engage in or seek to initiate any discussions with a Governmental Authority
with respect to holding or participating in any meeting with such Governmental
Authority, in each case relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement unless it consults with the other parties hereto in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties
hereto the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement and to Section 6.02(c), the Sellers, the Company
and the Acquiror shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing (including in seeking
early termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act);
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require any Seller, the
Company, any Transferred Subsidiary, the Acquiror or any of their respective
Affiliates (i) to disclose any information that in the reasonable judgment of
such Seller, the Company, such Transferred Subsidiary, the Acquiror or any of
their respective Affiliates (as the case may be) would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality or (ii) to disclose any privileged
information or confidential competitive information of such Seller, the
Company, such Transferred Subsidiary, the Acquiror or any of their respective
Affiliates. None of the parties hereto shall be required to comply with any
provision of this Section 6.05(d) to the extent that such compliance would be
prohibited by applicable Law.

(e) The Sellers, the Company and the Acquiror shall use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain any other consents and approvals and make any other
notifications that may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that none of the Sellers,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to
compensate any third party, commence or participate in litigation or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain
any such consent or approval; and provided, further, that none of the Sellers,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to take
any action with respect to any third party in connection with obtaining any
consent or approval unless such action is conditioned upon the Closing.

(f) The parties hereto agree that the "Form A" change of control application
filed by the Acquiror with the New Hampshire Insurance Department (the "NH
Insurance Department") relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (inclusive of all exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto (including
any plan of operations filed therewith), the "Form A") shall not state, imply
or include any proposal, plan or intention to conduct business, or take any
action, that is in any material respect inconsistent with Section 6.05(f) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the written materials relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement provided to the NH Insurance
Department by or on behalf of the Acquiror on June 13, 2014.

Section 6.06. Affiliate Obligations and Arrangements. Except as set forth on
Section 6.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Sellers shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, take such actions, if any, as may be
necessary so that, concurrently with or prior to the Closing, all Affiliate
Agreements are terminated and discharged without any further liability or
obligation of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries thereunder and
deemed to be void and of no further force and effect.

Section 6.07. Intellectual Property.

(a) The Acquiror, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that
the Acquiror is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right,
title or interest in or to any Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to
any Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries) as of the Closing Date. Neither the Acquiror nor any
of its Affiliates (including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
shall have any rights in or to, or make any use of, any such Intellectual
Property, except pursuant to a Contract between the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary and the applicable Intellectual Property owner or licensee.

(b) The Sellers, for themselves and their Affiliates, acknowledge and agree
that, following the Closing, they shall retain no right, title or interest in
or to any Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary as of the Closing. Following the Closing, neither the
Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall have any rights in or to, or make
any use of, any such Intellectual Property, except pursuant to a Contract
between any Seller or any of its Affiliates and the applicable Intellectual
Property owner or licensee.

Section 6.08. Guarantee.

(a) Parent hereby unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees,
undertakes and promises to cause the Acquiror to fully and promptly pay,
perform and observe all of the Acquiror's obligations under, with respect to,
in connection with or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement
(collectively, the "Obligations"), as shall be in effect from time to time
according to the present terms hereof, or pursuant to any change in the terms,
covenants and conditions hereof at any time hereafter made or granted,
including pursuant to any amendments, waivers, extensions or renewals
affecting this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. In the
event that the Acquiror fails in any manner whatsoever to promptly pay,
perform or observe any of the Obligations, Parent will itself duly and
promptly pay, perform or observe, as the case may be, such Obligations, or
cause the same to be duly and promptly paid, performed or observed, in each
case as if Parent were itself the Acquiror with respect to such Obligations.

(b) In regards to monetary obligations, Parent agrees that its guarantee under
this Section 6.08 constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of
collection. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.08 to the contrary, any
Seller may proceed to enforce this Section 6.08 against Parent without first
pursuing or exhausting any right or remedy that such Seller or any of its
successors or assigns may have against the Acquiror, any of its successors or
assigns (or any Affiliates thereof) or any other Person. Any payment by Parent



53



pursuant to this Section 6.08 will, to the extent of actual receipt by the
applicable Seller or Sellers of such payment in accordance with this Agreement
as it relates to any Obligation under this Agreement, discharge such
Obligation of the Acquiror to such Seller or Sellers under this Agreement.

(c) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent waives (i) any
defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Acquiror on account of
lack of power or authority by the Acquiror to execute, deliver or perform this
Agreement; (ii) any right to require the Acquiror, as a condition of payment
or performance by Parent, to (A) proceed against any other guarantor of the
Obligations or any other Person or (B) pursue any other remedy whatsoever;
(iii) notices, demands, presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of
dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, notices of any renewal,
extension or modification of the Obligations or any agreement related thereto
and notices of any of the matters referred to in this Section 6.08(c) and any
right to consent to any thereof; and (iv) except as contemplated by Section
6.08(e), any other legal or equitable defense available to a surety or
guarantor under applicable Law (except, with respect to any Obligation, for
due payment or performance, as the case may be, of such Obligation).

(d) The obligations of Parent under this Section 6.08 shall be valid and
enforceable and shall not be discharged, terminated, reduced or impaired or
otherwise affected by, whether or not Parent shall have had notice or
knowledge of any of them, (i) the failure of any Seller to assert any claim or
demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of this
Agreement or otherwise, (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification
of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement other
than this Section 6.08 (and except and to the extent any rescission, waiver,
amendment, modification or release of or pursuant to this Agreement changes
the Obligations), (iii) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise,
in the payment or performance of the Obligations or (iv) any other act or
omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of
Parent or otherwise operate as a discharge of Parent as a matter of Law or
equity.

(e) Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.08, Parent shall have the
rights, remedies and legal or equitable defenses that are available to the
Acquiror under the terms of this Agreement or applicable Law with respect to
the Obligations.

(f) The obligations of Parent under this Section 6.08 shall not be reduced,
limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any
change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence
of the Acquiror, or any dissolution, insolvency, liquidation, conservation,
rehabilitation, bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, supervision,
arrangement or similar statutory, administrative, judicial or delinquency
proceeding of or affecting the Acquiror or any other guarantor of the
Obligations or by any defense which the Acquiror or any other guarantor of the
Obligations may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court
or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding unless also stayed
in connection with the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Parent.

(g) Parent agrees that its guarantee under this Section 6.08 shall continue to
be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or
any part thereof, of any



54



Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Acquiror or otherwise.

(h) Parent agrees that it shall have no right of subrogation, reimbursement,
contribution or indemnity with respect to payments made under this Section
6.08 until such time as all Obligations have been paid in full. If an amount
shall be paid to Parent on account of such rights at any time in violation of
the preceding sentence, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of
the Sellers and shall forthwith be paid to each Seller in proportion to such
Seller's Pro-Rata Share to be credited and applied to the obligations under
this Section 6.08.

(i) Parent agrees to pay on demand all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses of the Sellers (including the reasonable, documented fees
and expenses of its counsel) for the protection or enforcement of the rights
of the Sellers against Parent under this Section 6.08 (subject to, following
the Closing, Section 10.07(e)).

Section 6.09. Notification. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, the
Sellers and the Company, on the one hand, and the Acquiror and Parent, on the
other hand, shall promptly notify the other and keep it advised as to any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or it failing to perform or
comply with in any material respect any covenant or agreement to be performed
or complied with by it under this Agreement. No notification made pursuant to
this Section 6.09 shall have the effect of satisfying any condition set forth
Article VIII.

Section 6.10. Further Action. At any time after the Closing, each party hereto
shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, such
documents and other instruments as may be reasonably requested by another
party hereto that is required for such requesting party to satisfy its
obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 7.01. Employee Matters.

(a) The Acquiror agrees that, during the period commencing at the Closing and
ending on the second anniversary of the Closing, the Acquiror shall provide,
or shall cause to be provided, with respect to each employee and service
provider of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries who is employed as of
immediately prior to the Closing (each, a "Continuing Employee"), (A) base
salary and bonus opportunities (including annual bonus opportunities and long-
term incentive opportunities) that are no less favorable than the base salary
and bonus opportunities provided by the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing to each such Continuing
Employee, (B) pension and welfare benefits and perquisites that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing to each such
Continuing Employee and (C) severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits set forth on Section 7.01 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.



55



(b) For purposes of vesting, benefit accrual, vacation and sick time credit
and eligibility to participate (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of the Acquiror and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Continuing Employee after the Closing (including the Benefit Plans) (the "New
Plans"), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Closing, to the same extent as such Continuing
Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under
any similar Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Acquiror
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
replacing comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately before the Closing (such plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, any evidence of insurability requirements, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Old Plan. The Acquiror shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Continuing Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year.

(c) The Acquiror acknowledges and agrees to make all payments in respect of
the SARs listed on Section 4.02(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in
accordance with the terms of the SAR Plan as operated by the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course of Business. For the avoidance
of doubt, in calculating the "Exercise Date Book Value" for purposes of
Section 5(a) of the SAR Plan, the "Book Value" as of the "Change in Control"
date (as such terms are defined in the SAR Plan) shall be determined
consistent with the manner in which the Company determines the book value per
share of the Shares at quarter- and fiscal year-end in the Ordinary Course of
Business.

(d) The Acquiror shall, and shall cause any successor thereto to honor,
assume, fulfill and discharge the Company's and the Transferred Subsidiaries'
obligations under all Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms.

(e) The Acquiror shall pay a bonus in respect of the 2014 fiscal year (a "2014
Bonus") to each Continuing Employee at the time annual bonuses would otherwise
be paid by the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary in the Ordinary Course of
Business. With respect to the 2014 Bonuses, (i) the aggregate amount available
to pay 2014 Bonuses shall be at least equal



56



to the amount accrued through the end of calendar year 2014 for 2014 Bonuses
for financial reporting purposes (unless the Chief Executive Officer of the
Insurance Subsidiaries determines to reduce such aggregate payment amount in
his sole discretion) and (ii) the percentage of base salary used to determine
2014 Bonuses for all Continuing Employees who are officers and for all
Continuing Employees who are not officers shall be at least equal to
percentage of base salary used to determine the annual bonuses for officers
and non-officers, respectively, of the Transferred Subsidiaries for annual
bonuses in respect of calendar year 2013 (unless the Chief Executive Officer
of the Insurance Subsidiaries determines to reduce such percentage of base
salary in his sole discretion). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Acquiror hereby agrees to honor the recommendations made by the
Chief Executive Officer of the Insurance Subsidiaries with respect to the
amount of each individual Continuing Employee's 2014 Bonus. In addition, the
Acquiror shall pay to any Continuing Employee who is terminated by the Company
or a Transferred Subsidiary for any reason other than the Continuing
Employee's fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence prior to the payment
of the 2014 Bonuses an amount at least equal to such Continuing Employee's
bonus in respect of the 2013 fiscal year (unless the Chief Executive Officer
of the Insurance Subsidiaries determines to reduce such amount in his sole
discretion), prorated to reflect the number of days such Continuing Employee
was employed during the 2014 bonus year, such payment to be made no later than
the second payroll period after the date of such termination.

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.01 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, is intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or
adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA
or otherwise be treated as an amendment or modification of any Benefit Plan,
New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement, (ii) limit the right
of the Acquiror, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit
plan, agreement or arrangement following the Closing or (iii) create any
third-party beneficiary or other right (x) in any Person, including any
current or former employee of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, any
participant in any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or
arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) other than with respect
to Section 7.01(e), with respect to which the Company, the Sellers and the
Acquiror hereby expressly acknowledge and agree the Continuing Employees have
third-party beneficiary rights, or (y) to continued employment with the
Acquiror, the Company or any other their respective Subsidiaries.

representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in Section 3.04 and
the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 4.02(a)
shall be true and correct in all respects (except, in the case of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 4.02(a),
for any failures to be true and correct that, individually or in the
aggregate, are de minimis in nature and amount) as of the Closing Date, as if
made on such date (other than such representations and warranties made as of
another stated date, which representations and warranties shall have been true
and correct in all respects as of such date), (y) each of the representations
and warranties of the Sellers contained in Section 3.01 and the
representations of the Company contained in Section 4.01, Section 4.02(b) and
Section 4.25 shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the

limitations as to materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein) and (z) each of the other representations and warranties of the
Sellers and the Company contained in Article III and Article IV shall be true
and correct as of the Closing Date, as if made on the Closing Date (other than
such representations and warranties made as of another stated date, which
representations and warranties shall have been true and correct as of such
date) (without giving effect to any limitations as to materiality or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), except, in the case of this
clause (z), for those failures of such representations and warranties to be so
true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, or
would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect;
(ii) each of the covenants and agreements of the Sellers and the Company to be
performed or complied with on or prior to the Closing (other than the
covenants and agreements contained in Section 6.09) shall have been performed

ARTICLE IX 

TERMINATION

Section 9.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing:



59



(a) by the mutual written consent of the Acquiror and the Sellers;

(b) by either the Sellers or the Acquiror if the Closing has not occurred on
or before December 31, 2014 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that
if the sole reason that the Closing has not occurred is that one or more of
the approvals of the Governmental Authorities required pursuant to Section
8.01(b) have not been obtained on or prior to such date, such date may be
extended by either party hereto to a date not beyond March 31, 2015 (which
shall then be the "Termination Date"); and provided, further, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(b) shall not be available
to any party hereto whose failure to take any action required to fulfill any
of such party's obligations under this Agreement has caused or resulted in the
failure of the Closing to occur prior to the Termination Date;

(c) by either the Sellers or the Acquiror in the event of the issuance of a
final, non-appealable Governmental Order restraining or prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(d) by the Acquiror (but only so long as the Acquiror is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement) if there has been a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Sellers or the
Company, which breach would result in the failure to fulfill one or more of
the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.03, and such
breach shall be incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall
not have been cured prior to the earlier of (i) twenty (20) Business Days
after providing written notice of such breach to the breaching party and (ii)
the day immediately preceding the Termination Date; or

(e) by the Sellers (but only so long as the Sellers and the Company are not in
material breach of their obligations under this Agreement) if there has been a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Acquiror,
which breach would result in the failure to fulfill one or more of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02, and such
breach shall be incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall
not have been cured prior to the earlier of (i) twenty (20) Business Days
after providing written notice of such breach to the Acquiror and (ii) the day
immediately preceding the Termination Date.

Section 9.02. Notice of Termination. Any party hereto desiring to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01 shall give written notice of such
termination. In the case of any such termination by the Acquiror, such written
notice shall be given to the Sellers and in the case of any such termination
by the Sellers, such written notice shall be given to the Acquiror.

Section 9.03. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto;
provided, however, that (i) no such termination shall relieve any party hereto
of any liability to the other party hereto resulting from fraud or any
intentional breach of this Agreement and (ii) Article XI and the agreements
contained in Section 6.04(a) and this Section 9.03 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE X 

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 10.01. Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement (and the
Indemnified Parties' respective rights to claim indemnification under this
Article X in respect thereof), other than (a) the covenants and agreements
contained in Section 6.02 (Access to Information), Section 6.03 (Books and
Records), Section 6.04 (Confidentiality), Section 6.07 (Intellectual
Property), Section 6.10 (Further Action) and Article VII, which shall survive
the Closing in accordance with their terms, and (b) the covenants and
agreements contain in Section 6.09 (Notification), which shall terminate at
the Closing, shall survive and continue in full force and effect until the
earlier of (i) the date that is thirty (30) days from the date on which
Parent's 2014 audit of its consolidated financial statements has been
completed and (ii) March 31, 2015 (such earlier date, the "Survival End
Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for indemnification under
this Article X in respect of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Sellers or the Company that is made on or prior to the
expiration of the Survival End Date shall survive until such claims are
finally resolved.

Section 10.02. Indemnification by the Sellers.

(a) From and after the Closing and subject to this Article X, each Seller
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror and its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) and their respective Representatives (collectively, the
"Acquiror Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all Losses incurred
or suffered by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties arising out of, resulting from
or relating to:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any Seller Representation of such Seller
contained in this Agreement as of the Closing Date as though made on such date
(or, in the case of any such Seller Representation made as of another stated
date, only as of such date);

(ii) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in this Agreement as of the Closing Date as though made on such date
(or, in the case of any such representations and warranties made as of another
stated date, only as of such date);

(iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers or of any Pre-
Closing Covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement; or

(iv) the amount of any Capital Stock Payments, Affiliate Agreement Payments or
Company Transaction Expenses to the extent not included in the calculation of
the Purchase Price as finally determined either pursuant to Section 2.04 or
Section 2.05; provided, however, that the Sellers shall have no
indemnification obligations under this Section 10.02(a)(iv) with respect to
any amounts that (x) the Acquiror asserted, during the negotiation and dispute
resolution process pursuant to Section 2.04 or Section



61



2.05, were Capital Stock Payments, Affiliate Agreement Payments or Company
Transaction Expenses and (y) were not included in the Purchase Price as
finally determined either pursuant to Section 2.04 or Section 2.05;

provided, that the Sellers shall only be liable to the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties for such Losses pursuant to this Section 10.02(a) in proportion to
their respective Pro-Rata Share of such Losses; provided, that nothing in this
Agreement shall restrict the Sellers from allocating responsibility for claims
pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i) solely amongst themselves in a different
manner; and provided, further, that for purposes of determining the inaccuracy
or breach of any representations or warranties of the Sellers or the Company
contained in this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 4.05(c) and Section 4.06), any materiality or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" qualifications in such representations and warranties
shall be disregarded.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall recover the amount of any Losses for which
they are finally determined to be entitled to indemnification under this
Article X solely from the Escrow Account and (ii) the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement for any
Losses in excess of the amounts then remaining in the Escrow Account;
provided, however, that this limit shall not apply to any Losses in respect of
claims for fraud, in which case the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall have
all rights available to them under applicable Law to recover the amount of
such Losses directly from the Sellers (which Sellers shall be severally and
not jointly liable for such Losses).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 10.02(a)(ii) (other than for indemnification for any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in Sections 4.01, 4.02
or 4.25): (i) with respect to any claim (or series of related claims arising
from the same underlying facts and circumstances) unless such claim (or series
of related claims arising from the same underlying facts and circumstances)
involves Losses in excess of $250,000 (nor shall any such excluded claim or
series of related claims be applied to or considered for purposes of
calculating whether the Indemnification Threshold has been satisfied under
clause (ii) below of this Section 10.02(c)); and (ii) unless and until the
aggregate amount of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties' Losses for which the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties are finally determined to be otherwise entitled
to indemnification under Section 10.02(a)(ii) exceeds an amount equal to
$6,900,000 (the "Indemnification Threshold"), in which case the Sellers shall
be responsible (with respect to each such Seller, in proportion to such
Seller's Pro-Rata Share) for all Acquiror Indemnified Parties' Losses for
which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties are finally determined to be otherwise
entitled to indemnification under Section 10.02(a)(ii) subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement.

Section 10.03. Indemnification by the Acquiror.

(a) From and after the Closing and subject to this Article X, the Acquiror
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and each of its Affiliates
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, will not include the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary) and



62



Representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and
against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified
Parties arising out of, resulting from or relating to:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Parent or
the Acquiror contained in this Agreement as of the Closing Date as though made
on such date (or, in the case of any such representations and warranties made
as of another stated date, only as of such date); or

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent or the Acquiror or any
Post-Closing Covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement;

provided, that for purposes of determining the inaccuracy or breach of any
representations or warranties of Parent or the Acquiror contained in this
Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in Section
5.09), any materiality or "Acquiror Material Adverse Effect" qualifications in
the representations and warranties shall be disregarded.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 10.03(a)(i) (other than for indemnification for any breach or
inaccuracy of any Acquiror Specified Representation): (i) with respect to any
claim (or series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts and
circumstances) unless such claim (or series of related claims arising from the
same underlying facts and circumstances) involves Losses in excess of $250,000
(nor shall any such excluded claim or series of related claims be applied to
or considered for purposes of calculating whether the Indemnification
Threshold has been satisfied under clause (ii) below of this Section
10.03(b)); and (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of the Seller
Indemnified Parties' Losses for which the Seller Indemnified Parties are
finally determined to be otherwise entitled to indemnification under Section
10.03(a)(i) exceeds an amount equal to the Indemnification Threshold, in which
case the Acquiror shall be responsible for all Seller Indemnified Parties'
Losses for which the Seller Indemnified Parties are finally determined to be
otherwise entitled to indemnification under Section 10.03(a)(i), subject to
the limitations set forth in this Agreement; and (iii) in a cumulative
aggregate amount exceeding the Escrow Amount, provided, however, that the
limit in clause (iii) shall not apply to any Losses in respect of claims for
indemnification involving fraud.

Section 10.04. Notification of Claims.

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
"Indemnified Party") shall promptly upon becoming aware notify the party or
parties liable for such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing
of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Article X,
including any pending or threatened claim or demand by a third party that the
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or
threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified
Party) (each, a "Third Party Claim"), describing in reasonable detail, to the
extent practicable, the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim or demand; provided, however, that the failure to



63



provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article X except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. The parties hereto
agree that (i) notices for claims in respect of a breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty or a breach of a covenant or agreement must be
delivered prior to the date of the expiration of any applicable survival
period, if any, specified in Section 10.01 for such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement and (ii) any claims for indemnification for which notice
is not delivered in accordance with clause (i) of this Section 10.04(a) prior
to the expiration of any such applicable survival period shall be expressly
barred and are hereby waived; provided, however, that if, prior to such
applicable date, if any, an Indemnified Party shall have notified an
Indemnifying Party in accordance with the requirements of this Section
10.04(a) of a claim for indemnification under this Article X (whether or not
formal legal action shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such
claim shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with this
Article X notwithstanding the passing of any such applicable date.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 10.04(a) in respect of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may, by written notice (a "Third Party Claim Notice") to
the Indemnified Party delivered within fifteen (15) Business Days of the
receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, assume and control the defense of
such Third Party Claim, with its own counsel and at its own expense, but shall
allow the Indemnified Party to participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim with its own separate counsel and at its own expense; provided, however,
that if the Indemnified Party shall have received written advice from outside
counsel (which need not be in the form of a formal written opinion of such
counsel and which may be in the form of an email indication of such counsel's
advice) that an actual or potential conflict of interest (including one or
more legal defenses or counterclaims available to such Indemnified Party or to
other Indemnified Parties which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party) would make it inappropriate for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
with respect to the Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party chooses to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own separate
counsel, then the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend a Third
Party Claim prior to the time the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for such
period. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Acquiror or the Sellers (as the case may be) shall, and shall cause
each of its or their Affiliates and Representatives to, reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such Third Party Claim. All
costs and expenses incurred in connection with such reasonable cooperation
shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld), consent to a settlement, compromise or
discharge of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim, unless (A) such settlement, compromise, discharge or entry of any
judgment (1) does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of Law
or admission of any wrongdoing by or on behalf of the



64



Indemnified Party or any violation of the rights of any Person by or on behalf
of the Indemnified Party and does not include a statement or admission of
fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
and (2) does not subject the Indemnified Party to any injunctive relief or
other equitable remedy and does not encumber any of the assets of any
Indemnified Party or result in any restriction or condition that would apply
to or affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Party's
business, and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall (1) pay or cause to be paid all
amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the
effectiveness of such settlement or judgment (unless otherwise provided in
such judgment and, in such case, in accordance with such judgment) and (2)
obtain, as a condition of any settlement, compromise, discharge, entry of
judgment (if applicable), or other resolution, a complete and unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party from any and all liabilities in respect of
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any Third Party Claim or
admit to any liability with respect to such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed in the case of any Third Party
Claim that the Indemnifying Party has elected not to defend); provided,
however, that any such consent provided by an Indemnifying Party shall not
prejudice such Indemnifying Party's ability to dispute whether an Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification for such Third Party Claim under this
Article X.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Sellers' Representative's assumption of
the defense of a Third Party Claim on behalf of the Sellers, the Acquiror
shall, and shall cause the Company to, retain books, data, files, information
and records in any media that are then within the Acquiror's or the Company's
possession or control and reasonably related to such Third Party Claim for a
period of time that the Sellers reasonably determine, in consultation with the
Acquiror, after taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances
related to the Third Party Claim that is the subject of such Third Party Claim
Notice (each such period, a "Third Party Claim Notice Period"). All reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the undertakings in this
Section 10.04(c) shall be promptly reimbursed to the Acquiror. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to
Section 10.04(b), the Indemnifying Party may direct the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim to take during the Third Party Claim Notice
Period reasonable measures (which measures shall be at least substantially
comparable to measures employed by the Indemnified Party (and, if applicable,
in the case of an Acquiror Indemnified Party, the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary) with respect to its own materials following the Closing) designed
to preserve attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product immunity to the
extent then existing in respect of Subject Materials reasonably relating to
such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall, upon the reasonable
written request of the Indemnifying Party, make reasonably available to the
Indemnifying Party such books, records or other documents and employees and
Representatives reasonably relating to such Third Party Claim that are within
the Indemnified Party's possession or control that are necessary or
appropriate for litigation related to such Third Party Claim. Solely in
connection with any Third Party Claim Notice where the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim referenced in such notice, each
of the Acquiror and each Seller mutually acknowledges, on behalf of itself and
its Indemnified Parties, that during



65



the applicable Third Party Claim Notice Period to the extent permitted under
applicable Law (x) each will share a common legal interest in preparing for
the defense of legal proceedings, or potential legal proceedings, arising out
of, relating to or in respect of the Third Party Claim or any counterclaim
reasonably related to such Third Party Claim (other than counterclaims against
any other party hereto or any such party's Affiliates) that is the subject of
such Third Party Claim Notice, (y) the sharing of Subject Materials reasonably
relating to such Third Party Claim will be for the purpose of furthering such
common legal interest and (z) by disclosing any Subject Materials reasonably
relating to such Third Party Claim to and/or sharing any Subject Materials
reasonably relating to such Third Party Claim with the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party is not intending to waive the attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product immunity or any other privilege or protection that may
be applicable to such Subject Materials. Except with respect to any sharing of
privileged materials under any common interest agreement or joint defense
agreement entered into by the Sellers and the Acquiror, the Indemnified Party
shall not be required to make available to the Indemnifying Party any
information to the extent it (I) is subject to an attorney-client or other
applicable legal privilege or any confidentiality agreement or obligation
prohibiting its disclosure or (II) might reveal any such privileged or
confidential information; provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party
has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
request, but shall not be required to obtain, a waiver of any such
confidentiality obligations upon the reasonable written request of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of privileged
information pursuant to this Section 10.04(c) without causing such privilege
to be lost.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article X
(including Section 10.02 and Section 10.03), no Indemnifying Party shall have
any liability under this Article X for any Losses arising out of or in
connection with any Third Party Claim that is settled or compromised by an
Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party consented to such
settlement or compromise or (ii) solely in the case of any Third Party Claim
that the Indemnifying Party has elected not to defend, it has been finally
determined that the Indemnifying Party unreasonably withheld its consent to
such settlement or compromise.

(e) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.04(a) that does not
involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days following its receipt of
such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this Article X.

Section 10.05. Payment.

(a) In the event a claim or any Action for indemnification under this Article
X has been finally determined, the amount of such final determination shall be
paid:

(i) if the Indemnified Party is an Acquiror Indemnified Party, to the
Indemnified Party from the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement and this Article X, on demand to the Sellers' Representative; and



66



(ii) if the Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified Party, to the
Indemnified Party by the Acquiror on demand (which demand may be made by the
Sellers' Representative) in immediately available funds.

(b) A claim or an Action, and the liability for and amount of damages
therefor, shall be deemed to be "finally determined" for purposes of this
Article X when the parties hereto have so determined by mutual agreement or,
if disputed, when a final, non-appealable Governmental Order has been entered
into with respect to such claim or Action.

Section 10.06. Exclusive Remedies. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees
that following the Closing, (a) the indemnification provisions of this Article
X shall be, in the absence of fraud, the sole and exclusive remedies of the
parties hereto for any breach or inaccuracy of the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or any breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, except, in each case, for the remedies
of injunction and specific performance under Section 11.12, and (b)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give
rise to any right on the part of any party hereto to rescind this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 10.07. Additional Indemnification Provisions.

(a) The Sellers and the Acquiror agree, for themselves and on behalf of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, that with respect to the amount of
any Losses that are subject to an indemnification obligation set forth in this
Article X, such Losses: (i) shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis, (ii)
shall be reduced by any insurance or other proceeds actually received in cash
by the Indemnified Party from any non-Affiliated third party (including
reinsurance or insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment actually recovered by any Indemnified Party from any such
third party, and after taking into account any deductibles, copayments or
other cost sharing arrangements) on account of the Losses, in each case, net
of the present value of any increase in insurance premiums or other charges
paid or reasonably expected to be paid by the Indemnified Party resulting from
such Losses and all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnified
Party in recovering such proceeds from such third party (such proceeds,
"Eligible Third-Party Proceeds"), (iii) shall not include (A) any punitive
damages other than punitive damages recovered by third parties in connection
with a Third Party Claim, (B) any Losses to the extent not the reasonably
foreseeable result of any failure of any representation or warranty of an
Indemnifying Party to be true and correct or a failure by an Indemnifying
Party to perform or comply with any of its covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement (provided that this clause (B) shall not apply to any Losses
that are recovered by third parties in connection with a Third Party Claim)
and (C) without limiting Section 10.07(e), any costs and expenses of
investigation, assertion, dispute, enforcement, defense or resolution,
including attorneys', actuaries', accountants' and other professionals' fees,
disbursements and expenses, to the extent incurred in connection with any
claim or dispute among the parties hereto as to whether a Seller Indemnified
Party, on the one hand, or an Acquiror Indemnified Party, on the other hand,
is entitled to indemnification under this Article X for any particular Loss or
Losses or to specific performance under Section 11.12



67



(for the avoidance of doubt, the limitations in this clause (C) shall not
apply with respect to costs and expenses relating to the investigation,
assertion, dispute, enforcement, defense or resolution of any Third Party
Claim, including attorneys', actuaries', accountants' and other professionals'
fees, disbursements and expenses incurred in connection with or in resolution
of any Third Party Claim); and (iv) shall be reduced by any amount
specifically reflected and reserved for such Loss on the Financial Statements
as of March 31, 2014.

(b) Any amount payable by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article X
shall be paid promptly and payment shall not be delayed or reduced pending any
determination of Eligible Third-Party Proceeds. In any case where an
Indemnified Party recovers any Eligible Third-Party Proceeds, such Indemnified
Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such
Eligible Third-Party Proceeds, but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified
Party in respect of such claim and (ii) any amount expended by the
Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such
matter.

(c) The parties hereto agree to treat and report (and cause their Affiliates
to treat and report) any payments received pursuant to this Article X as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law.

(d) If the Indemnified Party becomes aware that any portion of Losses
reimbursed or to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party may be covered, in
whole or in part, by third party insurance coverage provided by a non-
Affiliated insurer or by indemnification or other contribution provided by a
non-Affiliated third party under a Contract between or among the Indemnified
Party and such non-Affiliated third party, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party so requests in writing, the Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable
efforts at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party to collect such insurance
or other recoverable proceeds with respect to any such Losses.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.07(a)(iii)(C), in
the event of any claim or dispute among the parties hereto as to whether an
Acquiror Indemnified Party, on the one hand, or a Seller Indemnified Party, on
the other hand, is entitled to indemnification under this Article X for any
particular Loss or Losses or to specific performance under Section 11.12, the
non-prevailing party in such claim or dispute shall reimburse the prevailing
party for reasonable costs and expenses of investigation, assertion, dispute,
enforcement, defense (including any reasonable counterclaim) or resolution,
including reasonable attorneys', actuaries', accountants' and other
professionals' fees, disbursements and expenses, incurred by the prevailing
party in connection with such claim or dispute.

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the same Loss may be subject
to indemnification under more than one subsection of Section 10.02(a) or
Section 10.03(a), respectively; provided, however, that, in no event shall the
Seller Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, or the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties, on the other hand, be entitled to duplicative recoveries for the same
underlying Loss.

Sellers' Representative has full power and authority to give and receive any

made or taken by the Sellers pursuant to this Article X.

Section 10.10. Disbursement of Escrow Account Funds. All amounts distributed
from the Escrow Account to the Sellers, whether on the Survival End Date or
upon final resolution of any outstanding claims against the Escrow Account
under this Article X, shall be distributed to each Seller in proportion to its
respective Pro-Rata Share, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

Section 10.11. No Right to Contribution. From and after the Closing, (a)
neither the Sellers' Representative nor any Seller shall make any claim for
indemnification, contribution, reimbursement, set-off or similar rights of
recovery from the Acquiror, the Company, any Transferred Subsidiary or any of
their respective officers, directors or employees with respect to any Losses
of an Acquiror Indemnified Party arising under or in connection with Section
10.02(a), and (b) the Sellers' Representative, on its own behalf and on behalf
of all Sellers, hereby waives and relinquishes any and all rights to
indemnification, contribution, reimbursement, set-off or similar rights of
recovery, whether known or unknown, against the Acquiror, the Company, any
Transferred Subsidiary or any of their respective officers, directors or
employees that it has or may have in the future with respect to any breach by,
default or non-performance by the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary under
any representation, warranty or Pre-Closing Covenant contained in this
Agreement or any action or omission occurring prior to the Closing that may be
alleged to have resulted in any Losses of an Acquiror Indemnified Party
arising under or in connection with this Agreement.

Section 11.03. Public Announcements. No party hereto or any Affiliate or
Representative of such party shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or public announcement or otherwise communicate with any news media in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party hereto (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as may
be required by Law or applicable securities exchange rules, in which case the
party hereto required to publish such press release or public announcement
shall allow, to the extent reasonably practicable, the other parties hereto a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or public announcement
in advance of such publication or (b) to the extent reasonably necessary for a
party hereto to enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement. Prior to
the Closing, none of the parties hereto, nor any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, shall make any disclosure concerning plans or
intentions relating to the customers, agents, Producers or employees of, or
other Persons with significant business relationships with, the Company or any
of the Transferred Subsidiaries without first obtaining the prior written
approval of the other parties hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.



71



Section 11.04. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a
matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible. Nothing in this Section 11.04
shall affect the Acquiror's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01.

Section 11.05. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, other than the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent not in
conflict with this Agreement, between or on behalf of the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and shall be interpreted
without reference to any prior drafts hereof.

Section 11.06. Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of
the parties hereto. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section
11.06 shall be void; provided, however, that the Acquiror may, upon written
notice to the Sellers, assign to any Affiliate all or a portion of its rights
and obligations hereunder (including becoming a party to this Agreement)
without the consent of the other parties hereto; provided, further, that any
such assignment by the Acquiror to an Affiliate shall not, unless otherwise
agreed to by the parties hereto, (a) relieve the Acquiror or Parent of their
respective obligations under this Agreement or (b) delay the Closing;
provided, further, that following any such assignment, Parent shall guarantee
the obligations of such Affiliate as if such Affiliate was the Acquiror. This
Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns.

Section 11.07. No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns, and,
except as provided in Section 7.01(f), nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person (including any
policyholder of the Company or any of the Insurance Subsidiaries) any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

Section 11.08. Amendment; Waiver. No provision of this Agreement may be
amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument signed by all
of the parties thereto. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by
a written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the



72



exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law.

Section 11.09. Disclosure Schedules. Matters reflected in any section or
subsection of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, the Company Disclosure Schedule
or the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters
of a similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter
in any section or subsection of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, shall be construed as
an admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Acquiror
Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or
disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or
Governmental Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

Section 11.10. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial.

(a) This Agreement, all transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all
claims and defenses arising out of or relating to any such transactions or
agreements or the formation, breach, termination or validity of any such
agreements, shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflicts
of Law principles of such state that would apply the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

(b) Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally:

(i) submits for itself and its property to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery, or if the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks
jurisdiction of the subject matter, the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, or if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware lack jurisdiction of the
subject matter, any court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the State of
Delaware, in any Action directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the
formation, breach, termination or validity of this Agreement and agrees that
all claims in respect of any such Action shall be heard and determined solely
in such court;

(ii) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and
waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue or
jurisdiction of any such Action in such court or that such court is an
inconvenient forum for the Action and agrees not to assert, plead or claim the
same;

(iii) agrees that the final judgment of such court shall be enforceable in any
court having jurisdiction over the relevant party or any of its assets;



73



(iv) irrevocably waives any right to remove any such Action from the Delaware
Court of Chancery to any federal court;

(v) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in Section 11.02; and

(vi) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the applicable rules of
procedure.

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FORMATION, BREACH,
TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY
HERETO UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III)
EACH PARTY HERETO MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS SECTION 11.10. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.

Section 11.11. Rules of Construction. Interpretation of this Agreement shall
be governed by the following rules of construction: (a) words in the singular
shall be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender
shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires; (b)
references to the terms Preamble, Recitals, Article, Section, paragraph,
Schedule and Exhibit are references to the Preamble, Recitals, Articles,
Sections, paragraphs, Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement unless
otherwise specified; (c) references to "$" shall mean U.S. dollars; (d) the
word "including" and words of similar import shall mean "including without
limitation," unless otherwise specified; (e) the word "or" shall not be
exclusive (for example, the phrase "A or B" means "A or B or both," not
"either A or B but not both"), (f) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder"
or "hereby" and similar terms are to be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any specific Section; (g) the headings are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement; (h) this Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party
drafting or causing any instrument to be



74



drafted; (i) if a word or phrase is defined, the other grammatical forms of
such word or phrase have a corresponding meaning; (j) references to any
statute, listing rule, rule, standard, regulation or other law include a
reference to (A) the corresponding rules and regulations and (B) each of them
as amended, modified, supplemented, consolidated, replaced or rewritten from
time to time; (k) references to any section of any statute, listing rule,
rule, standard, regulation or other law include any successor to such section;
(l) references to any Person include such Person's predecessors or successors,
whether by merger, consolidation, amalgamation, reorganization or otherwise;
and (m) unless otherwise indicated, when calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating
such period is excluded.

Section 11.12. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, without the necessity of posting bond
or other undertaking, the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party
is entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any Action is brought in
equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall
allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense or counterclaim that
there is an adequate remedy at law.

Section 11.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties to each such agreement in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or other means of electronic transmission shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
