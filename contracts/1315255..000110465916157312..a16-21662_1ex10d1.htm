Closing Statement and not specifically disputed in a timely delivered
Objection Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If
Seller Representative does not timely deliver an Objection Notice with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to the Closing Statement within such thirty (30) day period, the
Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If an
Objection Notice is timely delivered within such thirty (30) day period, the
Purchaser and Seller Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
each dispute raised therein (each, an " _Objection_ "). If the Purchaser and
Seller Representative, notwithstanding such good faith efforts, fail to
resolve any Objections within fifteen (15) days after Seller Representative
delivers an Objection Notice, then the Purchaser and Seller Representative
shall jointly engage the dispute resolution group of Duff and Phelps Corporation
(the " _Resolution Firm_ ") to resolve such disputes (acting as an expert and
not an arbitrator) in accordance with this Agreement (including _Section
1.8_) as soon as practicable thereafter. The Purchaser and Seller
Representative shall direct the Resolution Firm to deliver a written report
containing its final determination of the subject matter of the disputed
Objections (which determination shall be within the range of dispute in
respect of each Objection between the amounts set forth on the Closing
Statement and the Objection Notice) within sixty (60) days after engagement of
the Resolution Firm.

 



 

The Resolution Firm shall make a final determination of each Objection based
solely on the definitions and other applicable provisions of this Agreement
(and shall not conduct an independent investigation) and on presentations
consisting of (i) a single written presentation submitted by each of the
Purchaser and Seller Representative (which the Resolution Firm shall be
instructed to distribute to the Purchaser and Seller Representative upon
receipt of both such presentations), (ii) a single written response of the
Purchaser and Seller Representative to each such presentation so submitted
(which the Resolution Firm shall be instructed to distribute to the Purchaser
and Seller Representative upon receipt of such responses) and (iii) at the
Resolution Firms discretion, a one-day conference concerning the dispute, at
which conference each of the Purchaser and Seller Representative shall have
the right to present their respective positions with respect to the dispute
and have present their respective advisors, counsel and accountants. For the
avoidance of doubt, neither the Purchaser nor Seller Representative shall have
any _ex parte_ communications with the Resolution Firm relating to this
_Section 1.5_ or this Agreement, and the Resolution Firm shall not conduct an
independent investigation in respect of its determination. All Objections that
are resolved between the Parties or are determined by the Resolution Firm will
be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties absent manifest error or
fraud. For the avoidance of doubt, assuming the procedure for resolving
disputes in this _Section 1.5_ is available, it shall be the sole and
exclusive procedure through which the Parties resolve any dispute under this
_Section 1.5_, but nothing contained herein shall preclude the Parties from
seeking other judicial remedies if a dispute arising under this _Section 1.5_
cannot be resolved through the procedure described herein; provided that the
party seeking other judicial remedies shall not have caused the failure of the
procedures herein to resolve the dispute. The costs and expenses of the
Resolution Firm shall be borne by the Purchaser and Seller Representative in
proportion as is appropriate to reflect their relative success in the
resolution of the dispute. For example, if Seller Representative challenges
the Purchasers calculation of the Final Purchase Price in the Closing
Statement (as the same has been updated as of the Purchasers submission to
the Resolution Firm) by an amount of $100,000 (as the same has been updated as
of Seller Representatives submission to the Resolution Firm), but the
Resolution Firm determines that Seller Representative has a valid claim for
only $60,000, then the Purchaser shall bear sixty percent (60%) of the fees
and expenses of the Resolution Firm and Seller Representative shall bear the
other forty percent (40%) of such fees and expenses.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.6 _Post-Closing Access_. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause each
Target Company to, make its financial records, accounting personnel and
advisors reasonably available to Seller Representative, its accountants and
other representatives pursuant to the terms of a customary confidentiality
agreement upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times during the review by
Seller Representative of, and the resolution of any Objections with respect
to, the Closing Statement to the extent related to the Objections. To the
extent the Sellers or Seller Representative retain any relevant financial
records, accounting personnel or advisors after the Closing, then Seller
Representative shall make such financial records, accounting personnel and
advisors reasonably available to the Purchaser, its accountants and other
representatives pursuant to the terms of a customary confidentiality agreement
upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times during the preparation and
review by the Purchaser of, and the resolution of any Objections with respect
to, the Closing Statement to the extent related to the Closing Statement or
the Objections, as applicable.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.5_
(the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause a Target Company to, pay to Sellers (as
instructed by Seller Representative) an amount equal to such excess by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after
the date on which the Final Purchase Price is finally determined.

 



 

(b) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Final Purchase
Price is finally determined, then Seller Representative and the Purchaser
shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse to the Purchaser a portion of the Working Capital
Escrow Fund equal to the amount of such shortfall; provided, that if the
Working Capital Escrow Fund does not contain sufficient funds to satisfy such
payment in full, then each Seller, severally, and not jointly, shall pay to
the Purchaser (to an account designated by the Purchaser) its Equity Interest
Percentage of the amount required to satisfy the shortfall contemporaneously
with the release of the funds in full from the Working Capital Escrow Fund to
the Purchaser.

 



 

(c) Within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Final Purchase
Price is finally determined, Seller Representative and the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction directing the Escrow
Agent to release and pay to Sellers (as instructed by Seller Representative),
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account designated
in such joint written instruction no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day
after the date on which the Final Purchase Price is finally determined an
amount, if any, equal to the Working Capital Escrow Fund remaining in the
Escrow Account after giving effect to any payment required pursuant to
_Section 1.7(b)_.

 



 

Section 1.8 _Accounting Procedures_. The Estimated Closing Statement, the
Closing Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein
shall be prepared and calculated on a consolidated basis for the Target
Companies in accordance with GAAP; _provided, however_ , such statements,
calculations and determinations: (i) shall not include any purchase accounting
or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) shall follow the defined terms contained
in this Agreement whether or not such terms are consistent with GAAP; and
(iii) the calculation of the Purchase Price shall be consistent with the
sample calculations set forth on _Exhibit A_, including any exclusions from
such calculation as specifically listed therein.

 



 

Section 1.9 _Indemnification Escrow_. The Indemnification Escrow Deposit,
together with any earnings or interest thereon (collectively, the "
_Indemnification Escrow Funds_ "), will be held until the first anniversary of
the Closing Date (the period from the Closing Date until such date, the "
_Indemnification Escrow Period_ ") to serve as an escrow fund for any
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Article VII_. The Indemnification Escrow
Funds will be released in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.10 _Seller Representative_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 5.9(i)_, each Seller hereby
designates and appoints Seller Representative as the representative and
attorney in fact of such Seller for the sole purpose of acting on such
Sellers behalf with respect to this Agreement, the Subscription Agreements,
the Escrow Agreement and the other documents to be executed and delivered by
such Seller under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Seller Documents_ "),
including full power and authority on behalf of such Seller: (i) to take all
actions Seller Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection
with the pre-Closing covenants and agreements of the Sellers set forth in this
Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of Closing conditions under this
Agreement, including exercise of the power, authority and discretion conferred
on the Sellers under this Agreement to waive any conditions of this Agreement;
(ii) to take all actions Seller Representative deems necessary or appropriate
in connection with the post-Closing implementation of this Agreement,
including defending, negotiating, settling, compromising and otherwise
handling any claims for indemnification made by a Purchaser Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Article VII_ (including authorizing the delivery to the
Purchaser of any portion or all of the Indemnification Escrow Deposit in
satisfaction of any such indemnification claims), pursuing or responding to
litigation and complying with orders of courts with respect to any claims made
hereunder; and (iii) to take all other actions Seller Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in connection with the foregoing, including entering
into or providing any amendments, modifications or waivers with respect to
this Agreement and the other Seller Documents and giving and receiving
notices, requests, demands, waivers and other communications on behalf of the
Sellers. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on all statements, representations and decisions of Seller
Representative as those of the Sellers, without any independent investigation
or verification. Seller Representative may resign at any time by giving thirty
(30) days notice to the Purchaser and the Sellers, and Seller Representative
may be removed at any time by the Sellers; provided, however, in no event
shall Seller Representative resign or be removed without the Sellers having
first appointed a new Seller Representative who shall assume such duties
immediately upon the resignation or removal of Seller Representative. If
Seller Representative is dissolved, resigns or otherwise becomes incapable of
fulfilling its obligations under any of the Seller Documents, the Sellers
shall promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days appoint a new
Seller Representative. Sellers shall promptly, but in any event within five
(5) Business Days after appointing a new Seller Representative deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Purchaser a notice identifying the

 



      
 

 



 

new Seller Representative. Any notice sent by the Purchaser to Seller
Representative prior to receipt of a notice identifying a new Seller
Representative shall be binding on the Sellers.

 



 

(b) Seller Representative shall not be liable to Sellers for actions taken
pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent such actions shall have been
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted gross
negligence or involved fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith (it being
understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel,
accountants and other professionals and experts retained by Seller
Representative shall be conclusive evidence of good faith and an absence of
gross negligence). Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
Representative from and against, compensate it for, reimburse it for and pay
any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, arising out of and in
connection with its activities as Seller Representative under this Agreement
(the " _Representative Losses_ "), in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided that in the event it is finally adjudicated
that a Representative Loss or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the
gross negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith of Seller
Representative, Seller Representative shall reimburse Sellers the amount of
such indemnified Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence,
fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith. Representative Losses shall be
satisfied (i) from the Cash Reserve; and (ii) to the extent the amount of
Representative Losses exceeds amounts available to Seller Representative under
(i), from the Sellers (other than Seller Representative), severally and not
jointly in accordance with their respective Equity Interest Percentage.

 



 

Section 1.11 _Withholding_. The Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to or as
contemplated by this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under the Code or Treasury
Regulations or any other provision of applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Purchaser agrees that it shall not deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement any
amounts under Section 1445 of the Code to the extent (i) the Company has
delivered to the Purchaser prior to Closing the properly completed and
executed certificate contemplated by _Section 1.4(b)(viii)_ and (ii) CVC has
delivered to the Purchaser prior to Closing the properly completed and
executed certificate contemplated by _Section 1.4(b)(vii)_. Such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. The Purchaser
and the Sellers shall cooperate with each other and the Company in the
preparation and filing of any forms or other documentation claiming exemption
or relief from any requirement to withhold.

 



 

ARTICLE II 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE TARGET COMPANIES

 



 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing, as follows:

 



 

Section 2.1 _Formation; Existence; Good Standing; Authority; Enforceability_.
The Company is a private company limited by shares, duly incorporated and
validly existing under the laws of Ireland and has all required corporate
power and authority to own or lease its

 



      
 

 



 

properties and other assets and to conduct its business as presently
conducted. The Company is duly qualified and in good standing (or the
equivalent thereof) in Ireland. The nature of the Companys business,
including its ownership and leasehold interests in properties and assets, if
any, does not require it to be qualified as a foreign corporation in any other
jurisdiction. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Share Purchase
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action with respect to the Company. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company.
This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
for the Equitable Exceptions. The Company is not in breach of its
Organizational Documents. Each of Hibernia Atlantic (NI) Limited and Hibernia
Local Fibre Limited (collectively, the " _Dormant Subsidiaries_ ") are in the
process of being wound down. Neither of the Dormant Subsidiaries owns any
assets, conducts any business or generates any revenue.

 



 

Section 2.2 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, assuming the Seller Required Consents are filed and, if applicable,
obtained prior to the Closing, the execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement and any other documents required to be executed and delivered
by the Company under this Agreement do not, the performance by the Company and
the other Target Companies, as applicable, under this Agreement and each such
other document to which the Company is a party will not, and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder will not: (i)
violate or conflict with the Organizational Documents of any Target Company;
(ii) with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both,
constitute a material breach of or result in a material default (or an event
which might, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both,
constitute a material default) under, or result in any other party thereto
having a right of termination, modification, cancellation or acceleration
under, any Material Contract to which any Target Company is a party or by
which any of their respective assets or properties are bound; (iii) result, in
any material respect, in a violation of any applicable Law; (iv) result in the
creation or imposition of any Liens on any of the properties or other assets
of any Target Company or on the Shares (other than Liens arising from actions
of the Purchaser) or (v) result in the termination, suspension, revocation,
impairment, forfeiture, nonrenewal or other adverse modification of any
License or Rights of Way or give any Governmental Authority the right to
revoke, suspend, modify or termination any material License or Right of Way.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the notices and consents set forth therein, collectively the "
_Seller Required Consents_ "), no consent, approval, waiver, order, License or
authorization of, or registration, application, qualification, designation,
declaration, filing or notification with or to, any Governmental Authority or
any other Person that is a party to a Material Contract to which any Target
Company is a party or by which any material assets or properties of any Target
Company are bound, is required to be obtained or made by any Target Company in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Company or
either Seller of this Agreement or any

 



      
 

 



 

other Seller Documents to which the Company or either Seller will be a party
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Capitalization_. The Shares collectively constitute all of the
issued and outstanding equity interests of the Company, and the Shares are
legally and beneficially owned as set forth in _Section 2.3_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid up. None of such Shares are subject to, or have been issued
in violation of, preemptive rights, rights of first offer or first refusal or
similar rights or in violation of applicable securities Law. Except as set
forth in _Section 2.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no
Contracts to which a Target Company is a party that relate to the ownership,
voting or transfer of the Shares. Except as set forth in _Section 2.3_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Shares are subject to any rights of
first offer or first refusal or similar rights. Except as set forth in
_Section 2.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, pre-emptive rights, options, warrants, purchase rights,
conversion rights, exchange rights or other Contracts of any kind to acquire
(including securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into)
from the Company any equity interest of the Company, or obligating the Company
to issue any equity interest of the Company or, giving any Person the right to
receive from the Company any benefits or rights similar to any benefits or
rights enjoyed by or accruing to the benefit of the holders of any equity
interests of the Company (solely in their capacity as such holders). Except as
set forth in _Section 2.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company is
not subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to redeem, call,
retire or otherwise repurchase any equity interests of the Company. None of
the Target Companies has any authorized or outstanding bonds, debentures,
notes or other Indebtedness the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for
or acquire securities having the right to vote) with the equityholders of any
Target Company on any matter.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) _Section 2.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the legal name
and jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or formation (as applicable)
of all Company Subsidiaries and the authorized (if applicable), issued and
outstanding equity interests of each Company Subsidiary. Each of the Company
Subsidiaries is an entity duly incorporated, organized or formed (as
applicable) and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, organization or formation (as applicable) and has all required
power and authority to own or lease its properties and to conduct its business
as presently conducted. Each Company Subsidiary is qualified to do business
and is in good standing (or the equivalent thereof, if any, for any non-U.S.
Company Subsidiaries) in each jurisdiction where its assets or the nature of
its business and operations requires such qualification and authorization,
except in each case, in jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
in good standing (if applicable) could not be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. _Section 2.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true, correct and complete list of each jurisdiction in which
each Company Subsidiary is qualified as a foreign entity to do business. No
Company Subsidiary is in breach of its Organizational Documents in any
material respect.

 



 

(b) All of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each Company
Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid
and, to the extent

 



       
 

 



 

such concept is recognized in the applicable jurisdiction, non-assessable
(with the exception of the equity interests of Hibernia Atlantic
Communications (Canada) Company, a Nova Scotia unlimited company, the
assessability of which is subject to the Companies Act (Nova Scotia)), and
none of such equity interests are subject to or were issued in violation of
any pre-emptive rights, rights of first offer or first refusal or similar
rights, or in violation of any applicable securities Law. Except as set forth
in _Section 2.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of such equity
interests is subject to any rights of first offer, first refusal or preemptive
or similar rights. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
purchase rights, conversion rights, exchange rights or other Contracts of any
kind to acquire (including securities exercisable or exchangeable for or
convertible into) from any Company Subsidiary any equity interests of any
Company Subsidiary, obligating such Company Subsidiary to issue any equity
interests of such Company Subsidiary or giving any Person the right to receive
from any Company Subsidiary any benefits or rights similar to any benefits or
rights enjoyed by or accruing to the benefit of the holders of equity
interests of such Company Subsidiary (solely in their capacity as such
holders). None of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to any obligation
(contingent or otherwise) to redeem, call, retire or otherwise repurchase any
of its equity interests. Except as set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no Contracts to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party with respect or by which it is bound with
respect to the: (i) voting of any equity interests of any Company Subsidiary;
or (ii) transfer of, or transfer restrictions on, any equity interests of any
Company Subsidiary. All of the outstanding equity interests of each Company
Subsidiary are directly owned of record by the Company or another Company
Subsidiary, and, except as set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, are free and clear of any Liens other than Liens to be
released on or prior to the Closing. Except for the Company Subsidiaries, the
Company does not own, and the Company Subsidiaries do not own, any capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, any Person.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) Attached as _Section 2.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule are: (i)
the audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as at December 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, together with the related audited consolidated
statements of income, equity and cash flows of the Company for each of the
years then ended, together with all related notes and schedules thereto,
accompanied by the reports thereon of the Companys independent auditors (the
" _Audited Financial Statements_ "); and (ii) the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as at September 30, 2016 (the " _Balance Sheet
Date_ "), together with the related unaudited consolidated statements of
income, equity and cash flows of the Target Companies for the nine-month
period then ended (the " _Unaudited Financial Statements_ " and, together with
the Audited Financial Statements, the " _Financial Statements_ "). Each of the
Financial Statements has been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied as at the date thereof and for the periods covered thereby (subject,
in the case of the Unaudited Financial Statements, for normal year-end audit
adjustments, none of which adjustments will, individually or in the aggregate,
be material, and the omission of footnotes). The Financial Statements fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial condition of the
Company as of such dates and the consolidated results of operations for the
periods then ended. No Target Company is a party to, and no Target Company has
any commitment to become a party to, any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except (i) as disclosed in the balance sheet included in the Unaudited
Financial Statements, (ii) as set forth in _Section 2.5(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or (iii) with respect to the obligation of any Target
Company to repurchase a fiber pair under the terms of the Microsoft Documents,
none of the Target Companies had at the Balance Sheet Date, or has incurred
since such date, any liabilities or obligations that would be required to be
disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except for such liabilities or obligations that: (A)
were incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business
(none of which results from or relates to any breach of Contract, tort,
infringement or violation of Law or arose out of any Proceeding except to the
extent otherwise disclosed herein); (B) are expressly permitted by this
Agreement; or (C) have been discharged or paid in full as of the date of this
Agreement, or will have been discharged or paid in full at or prior to the
Closing.

 



 

(c) Each Target Company maintains books and records that fairly and accurately
reflect in all material respects its assets and liabilities of a type normally
reflected in such books and records. The Target Companies have established and
documented, and maintained, adhered to and enforced a system of internal
accounting controls which have been designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements (including the Financial Statements), including policies
and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that (i)
transactions have been executed only in accordance with managements
authorization, (ii) transactions have been recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Company in
accordance with the GAAP and to maintain accountability for the assets and
liabilities of the Target Companies, (iii) receipts and expenditures of the
Target Companies have been executed only in accordance with managements
authorization, (iv) unauthorized acquisition, disposition or use of assets is
prevented or timely detected, and (v) accounts, notes and other receivables
are recorded accurately, and procedures are implemented to effect the
collection thereof on a current and timely basis. To the Knowledge of the
Company, such internal accounting controls are appropriate for a private
company with operations of the size and scope of the operations of the Target
Companies. None of the Target Companies, the Companys independent auditors
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any current or former employee,
consultant or director of the Target Companies, has identified or been made
aware of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves any Target
Companys management or other current or former employees, consultants,
directors of any Target Company who have a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by the
Target Companies, or any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

 



 

(d) Attached as _Section 2.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a
listing of the intercompany Indebtedness of the Company Group as of September
30, 2016.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2015 (i) there
has been no Material Adverse Effect and (ii) except to the extent permissible
during the Pre-Closing Period pursuant to _Section 5.2_, the Target Companies
have operated, in all material respects, in the ordinary course of business,

ARTICLE IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER

 



 

The Purchaser represents and warrants to the Sellers, as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing, as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Formation; Existence; Good Standing; Authority; Enforceability_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser is a corporation duly incorporated, organized or formed and
validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all required
corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and other assets
and to conduct its business as

 



      
 

 



 

presently conducted. The Purchaser is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction
where its assets or the nature of its business and operations requires such
license, qualification or good standing (if applicable), except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Subscription Agreements and the other documents to be executed
and delivered by the Purchaser under this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Documents_ ") or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser has all required corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the other Purchaser Documents, to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by

Without limiting the foregoing, the execution of this Agreement and the

require the approval of the Purchasers equity holders.

 



 

(c) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Purchaser, and each other Purchaser Document will be duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Purchaser. Assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Company, the Sellers and Seller Representative, this Agreement
constitutes, and each other Purchaser Document will constitute, a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in
accordance with its terms, except for the Equitable Exceptions.

 



 

Section 4.2 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

 



 

(a) Assuming the Purchaser Required Consents are filed and, if applicable,
obtained prior to the Closing, the execution and delivery by the Purchaser of
this Agreement does not, the execution and delivery by the Purchaser of the
other Purchaser Documents will not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby will not: (i) violate or conflict with the
Organizational Documents of the Purchaser; (ii) with or without the giving of
notice or the lapse of time, constitute a material breach of or result in a
material default under, or result in any other party thereto having a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration under, any material Contract to

and other assets are bound; or (iii) result, in any material respect, in a
violation of any Law applicable to the Purchaser.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.2(b)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule (the notices and consents set forth therein, collectively the "
_Purchaser Required Consents_ "), and filings and notifications to the SEC,
The New York Stock Exchange or the Purchasers transfer agent incidental to
the Purchasers status as a public company with shares listed on The New York
Stock Exchange, no consent, approval, waiver, Order, license or authorization
of, or registration, application, qualification, designation, declaration,
filing or notification with or to,

 



      
 

 



 

any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required to be obtained or
made by the Purchaser in connection the execution, delivery and performance by
the Purchaser of this Agreement and the other Purchaser Documents, the
performance by the Purchaser under this Agreement and each other Purchaser
Document, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Purchaser, threatened against the Purchaser, that: (a) could affect the
enforceability of this Agreement or any other Purchaser Document or any action
taken or to be taken by the Purchaser in connection herewith or therewith; (b)
seeks to enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby; or (c) would reasonably be expected to have, individually or together
with any other such Proceedings, a material adverse effect on the ability of
the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Brokers_. Except as set forth on _Section 4.4_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, the Purchaser is not and will not be obligated to pay any
brokerage, finders or similar fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Financial Ability to Perform_.

 



 

(a) Attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ is a true and complete copy of an executed
debt commitment letter and related term sheets (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_
"), entered into on or prior to the date hereof, from the Debt Financing
Sources pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which,
the Debt Financing Sources have committed, subject to the Debt Financing
Conditions, to provide loans in the amounts set forth therein for the purposes
of consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing
Date, and to pay the fees and expenses of the Purchaser in connection with the
negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the definitive
documents contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (the " _Debt Financing_ ").
The net proceeds from the Debt Financing (including after giving effect to all
"flex" provisions contained therein), together with cash on hand of the
Purchaser, will be sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including without limitation, the payment of any fees and
expenses payable hereunder on the Closing Date by the Purchaser.

 



 

(b) The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect as of the date of
this Agreement and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser
and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each of the other parties thereto, and
enforceable in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, except as may
be limited by the Equitable Exceptions. As of the date of this Agreement, (i)
the Debt Commitment Letter has not been terminated, amended, supplemented or
modified in any respect, and no amendment to the Debt Commitment Letter is
contemplated, and (ii) none of the commitments set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the
date of this Agreement, no Debt Financing Source has notified Purchaser of (A)
its intention to terminate the Debt Commitment Letter or not to provide any or
all of the Debt Financing or (B) any fact, condition, event or circumstance
that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Debt Financing from being

 



      
 

 



 

consummated and funded in full in accordance with, and within the time periods
set forth in, the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser is not in breach of any of the terms set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, and as of the date of this Agreement, to the Purchasers
Knowledge, no fact, condition, event or circumstance has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part of Purchaser, or any other parties thereto, under any term of the
Debt Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the consummation and funding of the full amount of
the Debt Financing at the Closing, other than the conditions expressly set
forth in this Agreement and the Debt Financing Conditions (collectively, the "
_Disclosed Conditions_ "). Except for this Agreement, standard fee letters
with respect to fees and related arrangements with respect to the Debt
Financing and the engagement letter and fee credit letter for the offering of
Notes (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, none of which amend or modify the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Disclosed Conditions in any respect, there are no side letters,
understandings or other Contracts or arrangements to which Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates is a party which in any way affect, amend, modify or relate to
the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser
has no reason to believe that any of the Debt Financing Conditions which are
within its control or influence will not be satisfied on or before the
Closing. The Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment and other fees
and other amounts that have been incurred in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letter and are due and payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing, and will pay, from the date
hereof through the Closing, all such commitment and other fees and other
amounts as they become due. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition
to Closing under this Agreement for the Purchaser to obtain the Debt Financing
or any alternative financing.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Investment Representations_. The Purchaser is purchasing the
Shares for investment purposes and not with a present view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof, within the meaning of the
Securities Act. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares have not been
registered under the Securities Act or qualified under applicable securities
Laws of any jurisdiction and understands the restrictions on resale of the
Shares imposed by the Securities Act and such applicable securities Laws. The
Purchaser also acknowledges that the Sellers and the Company have no
obligation to register the Shares, that there is no public market for the
Shares, that there may never be a public market for the Shares, and that, even
if such a market develops, the Purchaser may never be able to sell or dispose
of the Shares and, accordingly, the Purchaser must bear the economic risk of
this investment potentially indefinitely. The Purchaser is an "accredited
investor," as that term is defined in Rule 501 under Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Projections_. The Purchaser acknowledges that, other than as
expressly set forth in Articles II and III, none of the Company, the Sellers,
or any of their respective Affiliates, or any of the Companys, the Sellers
(or any of their respective Affiliates) respective agents, advisors or other
representatives has not made nor will be making any representations and
warranties with respect to: (a) any projections, estimates or budgets
delivered or made available to the Purchaser or any agent, advisor or other
representative of the Purchaser with respect to future revenues, future
results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or

 



      
 

 



 

future financial condition (or any component thereof) of any Target Company;
(b) any due diligence report delivered or made available to the Purchaser or
any agent, advisor or other representative of the Purchaser in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (c) any other information
or documents delivered or made available to the Purchaser or any agent,
advisor or other representative of the Purchaser with respect to any Target
Company, or their respective businesses, operations or any other matter
(except, as to each Seller, as provided in the other Seller Documents to which
such Seller is a party).

 



 

Section 4.8 _Independent Investigation; No Other Representations and
Warranties_. The Purchaser has conducted its own independent investigation,
review and analysis of the businesses, operations, results of operation,
financial condition and properties and other assets of the Target Companies.
The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that in making its decision to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, it
has relied solely upon its own investigation and upon the representations and
warranties of the Company and the Sellers expressly set forth in _Articles II_
and _III_ ; provided, that this disclaimer of reliance shall not be deemed a
waiver of or in any way impair, and shall not apply, in the case of Excluded
Fraud. The Purchaser acknowledges that any announcement by Sellers of their
intention to sell the Shares (as well as the execution of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) might affect one or
more of the customer relationships of the Company, and that any such effects
which clearly and demonstrably result from such announcement, do not and will
not constitute a breach of any of the Companys representations and warranties
whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly set forth in _Articles
II_ and _III_ and in the other Seller Documents. THE PURCHASER SPECIFICALLY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
THE COMPANY AND THE SELLERS SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE II_ AND _ARTICLE III_,
RESPECTIVELY, AND IN THE OTHER SELLER DOCUMENTS, NONE OF THE COMPANY, THE
SELLERS OR ANY OTHER PERSON (INCLUDING, ANY SHAREHOLDER, MEMBER, OFFICER,
DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER IN ANY
INDIVIDUAL, CORPORATE OR ANY OTHER CAPACITY) IS MAKING, AND THE PURCHASER IS
NOT RELYING ON, ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO ANY MATTER CONCERNING THE
TARGET COMPANIES, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and assuming (a) the representations and
warranties of the Company and the Sellers set forth in _Article II_ and
_Article III_ will be true and correct as of the Closing Date as though made
on and as of the Closing Date (to the extent relevant to the subject matter of
this _Section 4.9_), (b) the Company and the Sellers will have performed and
complied in all material respects with all covenants required to be performed
or complied with by the Company and the Sellers under this Agreement on or
prior to the Closing Date, and (c) immediately prior to the Closing, none of
the Target Companies will (i) be insolvent (either because its financial
condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the fair value of
its assets or because the fair salable value of its assets is less than the
amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts as they
mature) or (ii) have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay as they become
due, then the Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries (including the

 



      
 

 



 

Target Companies) shall be able to pay their respective debts as they become
due, shall own property which has a fair saleable value greater than the
amounts required to pay their respective debts (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities) and shall have adequate
capital to carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of property is
being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay
or defraud either present or future creditors of the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Target Companies).

 



 

Section 4.10 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of the
Purchaser consists of 80,005,000 shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of which
80,000,000 are designated as common stock (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ ")
and 5,000 are designated as preferred stock. At the close of business on
November 6, 2016, 37,198,778 shares of Purchaser Common Stock were issued and
outstanding, and (ii) 1,841,378 shares of Purchaser Common Stock were reserved

warrants, and other securities convertible into Purchaser Common Stock. At
the close of business on the date hereof, no shares of such preferred stock
were issued and outstanding, and no shares of such preferred stock were
reserved for any purpose.

 



 

(b) The rights, privileges and preferences of the Purchaser Common Stock are
as stated in the Purchasers Organizational Documents as filed with or
incorporated by reference into the Purchasers SEC Documents (as defined
below) through the date hereof. All of the outstanding shares of Purchaser
Common Stock have been duly authorized, are fully paid and nonassessable and

Stock issued or issuable pursuant to _Article I_ will be, when issued, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to,

refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any
provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Purchaser
Organizational Documents or any Contract to which the Purchaser is a party or
otherwise bound. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of the Sellers contained in this Agreement and the Subscription Agreements,
issuance of the Purchaser Stock to the Sellers in the manner contemplated by
this Agreement does not require registration under the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 4.12 _SEC Documents; Exchange Compliance_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits included therewith and
financial statements and schedules thereto and other information incorporated

period by the Purchaser on a voluntary basis on a Current Report on Form 8-K
being collectively referred to as the " _SEC Documents_ "). As of the date of
this Agreement, the

 



       
 

 



 

Purchaser has not received any written comments from the SEC staff with
respect to the SEC Documents that have not been resolved to the satisfaction
of the SEC staff.

 



 

(b) As of their respective dates, the SEC Documents complied as to form with
the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as applicable, and
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder in all
material respects. As of their respective dates, and as of the date any
information from the SEC Documents has been incorporated by reference, the SEC
Documents did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein made, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of their respective dates, the consolidated audited
financial statements of the Purchaser included in the SEC Documents, including
the notes thereto, complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the securities laws with respect
thereto. Such consolidated audited financial statements have been prepared in

position of the Purchaser as of the dates thereof and the results of its or

periods for Tax purposes, request any Tax ruling, enter into any Tax sharing
or similar agreement or arrangement (excluding, for this purpose, any
agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business that is not
primarily related to Taxes), or settle any Tax claim or assessment;

 



 

(xvii) not issue, grant or sell (x) any capital stock of any Target Company
(other than in connection with a recapitalization required to comply with any
applicable thin capital rules) or (y) any options, warrants, rights of
conversion, agreements, arrangements or commitments obligating any Target
Company to issue, deliver or sell any capital stock of any Target Company, or
make any other changes in the equity capital structure of any Target Company;
or

 



 

(xviii) not enter into any Contract or otherwise become obligated to take any
action prohibited under the foregoing _subsections (i)-(xvii)_.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Control of Operations_. Nothing in this _Article V_ shall give
the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Target Companies prior to Closing. Prior to Closing, the
Target Companies shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their respective
operations.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Efforts to Consummate; Regulatory and Other Approvals_.

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser shall, and the Sellers shall
(and shall cause the Target Companies to), in good faith and in a timely
manner, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions, do or cause to be done all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable, and execute and deliver such documents, as may
be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement,
consummate the Closing hereunder and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the provisions of _Section
5.4(c)_, the parties shall use their commercially

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable efforts to make all filings with any Governmental Authority
(including the HSR Act filings discussed in _Section 5.4(c)_ and filings
under any applicable U.S. Communications Laws or Foreign Communications Laws
or foreign antitrust or competition Laws) and to obtain all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals from, and to take all necessary actions to avoid any
Proceeding by, any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.4(a)_, during the Pre-
Closing Period, the Purchaser shall, and the Sellers shall (and shall cause
the Target Companies to), in good faith and in a timely manner, use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) cause the Closing
conditions contained in _Article VI_ applicable to such party to be
satisfied, and refrain from taking any actions that would have the effect of
delaying, impeding or preventing satisfaction of any of the Closing conditions
contained in _Article VI_ applicable to such party; and (ii) defend against
any Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any temporary
restraining order, preliminary injunction or other legal restraint or
prohibition entered or imposed by any Governmental Authority and that is not
yet final and non-appealable to be vacated or reversed. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall obligate any party to waive or
amend any condition set forth in _Article VI_ or any underlying
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

(c) Each of the Purchaser and the Sellers shall file or cause to be filed as
promptly as reasonably practicable with the United States Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice, in each case pursuant
to the HSR Act: (i) the notification and report form required for the
transactions contemplated hereby, which form shall be filed not later than
five (5) Business Days following the date of this Agreement; and (ii) any
supplemental information requested in connection therewith, which information
shall be filed as soon as reasonably practicable after the request therefor.
Any such notification and report form and supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act.

 



 

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser shall not, and it shall cause
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to not, enter into any letter of intent or
agreement to acquire, directly or indirectly: (A) any assets constituting a
line of business; (B) a controlling equity interest; or (C) any assets or
equity interests, in each case that would require a filing under the HSR Act
or any foreign antitrust or competition Laws or affect any existing filing
made by the parties hereunder under the HSR Act or any foreign antitrust or
competition Laws or any regulatory approval obtained in connection therewith.

 



 

(e) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall each
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of the
notices and requests referred to in this _Section 5.4_ and any filing or
approval process that is necessary under the HSR Act, U.S. Communications Laws
or Foreign Communications Laws, foreign antitrust and competition Law and any
other applicable Law. Except to the extent limited by applicable Law, the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall: (i)
each keep the other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, any

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Authority in connection with this process; (ii) in connection
therewith, provide each other the right to review in advance, and to the
extent applicable consult with each other on, all written materials submitted
to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Share Purchase and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably
practicable); and (iii) comply as promptly as reasonably practicable and in
any event in accordance with applicable Law with any such inquiry or request.
Any party may, as it reasonably deems advisable and necessary, designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other party under this
_Section 5.4_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials.

 



 

(f) Each of the Purchaser and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the
notice periods under the HSR Act and its commercially reasonable efforts to
take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice
periods under the U.S. Communications Laws or Foreign Communications Laws,
foreign antitrust and competition Law and any other applicable Laws with
respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of
this Agreement and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
Order in any suit or preceding, that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Target
Companies, the Sellers, the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall
not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or other
applicable Laws or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority
not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior
written consent of the Purchaser (in the case of the Target Companies, the
Sellers or their respective Affiliates) or Seller Representative (in the case
of the Purchaser or its Affiliates).

 



 

(g) The Purchaser shall pay one-half (½) of all filing fees related to the
filings contemplated by this _Section 5.4_ under the HSR Act and other
applicable Laws and the Company (on behalf of itself and the Sellers as a
Transaction Expense) shall pay the other one-half (½) of all such filing fees.
Any costs or expenses incurred by the Sellers and the Company in connection
with any inquiries by, or negotiations with, a Governmental Authority or any
legal proceedings regarding any necessary approvals under the antitrust Laws,
including without limitation costs and expenses related to a "second request"
under the HSR Act shall be a Transaction Expense.

 



 

(h) Purchaser has determined in accordance with 16 C.F.R. § 801.10(c)(3)) that
the fair market value of the non-exempt assets of the Company, determined as
of September 30, 2016, as determined in accordance with 16 C.F.R. § 802.51 is
less than $78,200,000.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Access and Information_.

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to the restrictions set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of June 22, 2016 between the Purchaser
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the Sellers shall cause
the Target Companies to permit the

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser and its representatives to have reasonable access, during normal
business hours and after reasonable prior notice to the Company, to (i) the
facilities, assets, properties, books and records of the Company, other than
any personnel information protected by applicable privacy Laws, and (ii) the
directors (or the equivalent position with respect to foreign Subsidiaries)
and the C-Level Officers, agents and representatives of the Target Companies
(collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ "), and shall make available
such information and documents in the Companys possession relating to any
Target Company as the Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided, however,_
that any such access by the Purchaser or its representatives shall not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the Hibernia Business by the Target
Companies or be reasonably likely in the written opinion of counsel to the
Target Companies to result in the waiver of any legal privilege. All
information provided or obtained pursuant to the foregoing shall be held by
the Purchaser in accordance with and subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to making any physical inspection of the Real
Property, the Purchaser shall provide to the Company: (A) reasonable advance
notice of the date and approximate time that the applicable inspection will be
conducted; and (B) the name of each individual who will be conducting such
inspection.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
during the Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser (and all of the representatives
and Affiliates thereof and any employees, directors and officers thereof)
shall not contact or communicate with employees (other than the C-Level
Officers), customers, suppliers and others having a business relationship with
the Target Companies in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
except with the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may be
withheld, conditioned or delayed at its sole discretion, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement or as otherwise
agreed by the Company in writing.

 



 

(c) Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Target Companies to, retain the books and records in existence as of the
Closing Date relating to the Target Companies and the Hibernia Business for a
period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, and during such period the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Target Companies to, afford promptly to
the Sellers, Seller Representative and their representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours to properties, books, records and employees of
the Target Companies to the extent necessary in order for the Sellers to
fulfill duties related to financial reporting, Tax return preparation or Tax
compliance of the Sellers or third-party claims that are not the subject of,
and would not reasonably be expected to become (assuming for this purpose the
on-going survival of all representations and warranties and pre-Closing
covenants and agreements of the Company set forth in this Agreement) the
subject of an indemnification claim under this Agreement and which cannot
reasonably be obtained from any other Person or in any other manner. The
Purchaser and the Sellers agree that any access or other rights under this
_Section 5.5(c)_ shall be provided only after reasonable advance written
request by a Seller and the Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with the
Purchaser and the Target Companies so that such access or other rights do not
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Target Companies. The parties agree
and acknowledge that the Purchaser may condition its obligations under this
_Section 5.5(c)_ on receipt from the Sellers, the Seller Representative and
their representatives, as applicable, of a customary agreement restricting use
and disclosure by such Persons of the information provided by the Purchaser or
the Target Companies to such Persons or otherwise obtained by them in Sellers
exercise of their rights under this _Section 5.5(c)_. The foregoing
provisions of this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 5.5(c)_ shall not apply with respect to the matters set forth in
_Section 5.9_, which shall be governed thereby.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Notification of Breaches_.

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, (a) the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers
and the Seller Representative as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of any breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or of any fact or condition that would
cause a condition to the Sellers obligations to consummate the Closing set
forth in _Article VI_ to not be satisfied, and (b) Seller Representative
shall notify the Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of any material breach of any of the Companys or either Sellers
representations and warranties, or the Companys or the Sellers covenants or
agreements, contained in this Agreement or of any fact or condition that would
cause a condition to the Purchasers obligation to consummate the Closing set
forth in _Article VI_ to not be satisfied. Except as provided in _Section
5.6(b)_, such notice shall not (i) be deemed to supplement or amend the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company, Sellers or the
Purchaser for the purpose of determining whether any of the conditions set
forth in in _Article VI_ have been satisfied or (ii) affect the right of any
Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party to indemnification
pursuant to _Article VII_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.6(a)_:

 



 

(i) if any notice delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section 5.6(a) _(A)
is only with respect to _Section 2.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(relating to Material Contracts, but solely with respect to the additions to
or deletions of any Material Contracts arising in the ordinary course of
business), _Section 2.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (relating to
Real Estate Leases, but solely with respect to the additions to or deletions
of any Real Estate Lease arising in the ordinary course of business), _Section
2.14(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (relating to Employee Benefit
Plans, but solely with respect to the additions to or deletions thereto
arising in the ordinary course of business), _Section 2.19(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (relating to the list of insurance policies, but solely
with respect to the additions to or deletions of any insurance policies
thereon arising in the ordinary course of business), _Section 2.25(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure or _Section 2.25(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(relating to customers and suppliers), (B) such disclosure is solely as to
changes that do not result from a non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant of
the Company set forth in this Agreement (or, with respect to deletions from
_Section 2.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, that do not result from
or relate to any breach or other non-performance of any Contract), and (C)
such disclosures are solely as to breaches other than the failure of a
representation or warranty of the Company to be true and correct on and as of
the date of this Agreement, then from and after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights it and all other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may have arising from or relating to a breach of
representation or warranty with respect to such sections that are described in
such notice (including any right to indemnification pursuant to _Article
VII_), and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) with regard to matters arising during the Pre-Closing Period, if any and
all notices delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_, in the
aggregate, disclose breaches that, in the aggregate, are reasonably expected
to result in Losses to the Target Companies of $1,500,000 or less, then from
and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any and
all rights it and all other Purchaser Indemnified Parties may have arising
from or relating to a breach of representation or warranty with respect to
such sections that are described in such notices (including any right to
indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_).

 



 

Section 5.7 _Publicity_. Except to the extent required by applicable Law: (a)
the Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly, make or cause to be made any
public announcement or issue any notice in respect of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
without the prior written consent of the Company; and (b) the Company, the
Sellers and Seller Representative shall not, directly or indirectly, make or
cause to be made any such public announcement or issue any such notice without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall consult with
Seller Representative, and each Seller shall consult with the Purchaser, prior
to issuing, or, in the case of the Sellers prior to the Closing and the
Purchaser after the Closing, permitting any Target Company to issue, any press
releases or otherwise making public statements with respect to this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
and prior to making any filings with any national securities exchange with
respect thereto. If Purchaser and the Company agree on a press release, then
each of the Company, the Purchaser, the Sellers, Seller Representative and
their respective Affiliates may issue further press releases and similar
announcements without the consent of Purchaser or the Company, as applicable;
_provided_ that each such press release or similar announcement contains, with
respect to the information concerning this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, no more
information than is contained in the initial press release. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, CVC and Murosa and their
respective owners may provide (a) financial results achieved by such Persons
and their Affiliates with respect to their beneficial interest in the Target
Companies and (b) a general description of the Target Companies in connection
with such Persons or their Affiliates fund raising, marketing, informational
or reporting activities (and for the avoidance of doubt CVC and Murosa shall
not be precluded from disclosing any information that is or becomes publicly
available after the date of this Agreement through the public filings required
to be made by the Purchaser). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, in no event will Purchaser or, after the Closing, the Target
Companies have any right to use such members or their Affiliates names or
marks, or any abbreviation, variation or derivative thereof, in any press
release, public announcement or other public document or communication without
the express written consent of such member or Affiliate thereof, except to the
extent necessary for the purpose of making a disclosure that is required by
Law or the rules, regulations or listing standards of the SEC or any national
securities exchange.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) With respect to each employee of the Target Companies as of the Closing
Date (each a " _Company Employee_ "), from the Closing Date through the period
ending on the earlier of the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date or
the termination of employment of such

 



      
 

 



 

Company Employee with the Purchaser or any Subsidiary of the Purchaser
(including the Target Companies), the Purchaser shall not reduce in any
material amount the compensation, employee benefits or incentive compensation
opportunities (other than equity-based, retention and pension compensation and
any stock appreciation right or other similar plan) to such Company Employee,
taken as a whole, below the compensation, employee benefits and incentive
compensation (other than equity-based, retention and pension compensation and
any stock appreciation right or other similar plan), taken as a whole, that
was provided to such Company Employee by the Target Companies as of the
Closing.

 



 

(b) For all purposes (other than benefit accrual under any defined benefit
plan) under each of the employee benefit plans of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Target Companies)
providing benefits to Company Employees in the applicable Company Employees
geographical area after the Closing (each, a " _New Plan_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited, to the maximum extent permitted by such New Plan,
with his or her years of service with the Company before the Closing to the
same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to
credit for such service under any similar Employee Benefit Plans; provided,
however, that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits or was not credited for the same
purpose with respect to such Company Employee under the analogous Employee
Benefit Plan, as applicable, immediately prior to the Closing or to the extent
that credit for such service is not available to similarly situated employees
of the Purchaser. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable New Plan: (i)
each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, as
promptly after the Closing as practical and commercially reasonable, in any
and all New Plans appropriate for such Company Employees geographical
location; (ii) the Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived in each New
Plan for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents; and (iii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, the Purchaser or its applicable
Affiliate shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents,
during the portion of the plan year of the Employee Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the Closing ending on the
date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins, to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year of the New Plan as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(c) The provisions contained in this _Section 5.7_ are for the sole benefit
of the respective parties hereto and no current or former employee, director,
consultant or service provider or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Employee, director, consultant or other service provider of any
Target Company any right to continued employment or continued service, as
applicable, for any period or continued receipt of any specific employee
benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any
New Plan, Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan. Nothing

 



       
 

 



 

contained herein shall limit the ability of Purchaser or its applicable
Affiliate to amend or terminate any New Plan or Employee Benefit Plan
(including any Foreign Plan) pursuant to its terms, so long as such amendment
or termination does not result in a breach of any of the obligations of
Purchaser under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(i) No later than sixty (60) days after the determination of the Closing
Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.5_, the
Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller Representative (a) a schedule allocating
the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price (any assumed liabilities not
already included in the definition of Purchase Price and other relevant items
treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the
assets of the Company and each Company Subsidiary that is treated as
disregarded for U.S. federal income Tax purposes in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code, (the " _Allocation_ ") and (b) a copy of any appraisals (or
drafts thereof) that Purchaser has commissioned in connection with its
assessment of the Allocation (the " _Appraisals_ "). The Seller Representative
shall have twenty (20) days upon its receipt of such Allocation to review the
Allocation, and if the Seller Representative does not notify Purchaser of any
objections thereto within such period, the Allocation shall become final and
binding on the parties. If the Seller Representative timely delivers a notice
of objection to the Allocation prepared by the Purchaser within thirty (30)
days of receipt of such Allocation, the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall consult and attempt to resolve in good faith any such
objection. If the Purchaser and Seller Representative, notwithstanding such
good faith efforts, fail to agree upon an allocation, then the Purchaser and
Seller Representative shall jointly engage the Resolution Firm to resolve
whatever disputes the Purchaser and the Seller Representative have regarding
the Allocation (the " _Allocation Disputes_ ") (acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator) in accordance with this _Section 5.9(a)_ as soon as practicable
thereafter. The Purchaser and Seller Representative shall direct the
Resolution Firm to deliver a written report containing its final determination
of the subject matter of such disputes within twenty (20) days after
engagement of the Resolution Firm. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the
Purchaser nor the Seller Representative shall have any ex parte communications
with the Resolution Firm relating to this _Section 5.9(a)_ or this Agreement.
All Allocation Disputes that are resolved between the Parties or are
determined by the Resolution Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties absent manifest error or fraud. The costs and expenses of the
Resolution Firm shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Purchaser and fifty
percent (50%) by the Sellers.

 



 

(ii) The Allocation as agreed between the Sellers and the Purchaser, or as
resolved by the Resolution Firm, shall be binding upon the Purchaser, the
Sellers, the Company and their respective Affiliates for all Tax purposes, and
each such Person, as applicable, (i) shall file, or cause to be filed, all
applicable Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8308 and the informational
statements required pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(a)(3), in
accordance with such allocation and (ii) shall not take or permit its
Affiliates to take any position on any Tax Return or in any Proceeding
relating to

 



      
 

 



 

Taxes that is inconsistent with such allocation, in each case, unless
otherwise required under applicable Law and provided that the Purchaser may
use an alternate allocation for financial reporting purposes.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding the above-specified timelines, Purchaser will make
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Sellers a draft of the Appraisal
within ninety (90) days after the date hereof.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges that the existence of the Company as a
partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes will terminate at the Closing
and that the Company will file a final IRS Form 1065 for the Tax year ending
on the Closing Date. For all Tax purposes, including Code Section 706(d), all
items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Target Companies for
the taxable year in which the Closing occurs shall be allocated between the
period ending on the Closing Date and the period commencing the day after the
Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books of the Target Companies
on the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of such
allocation, transactions occurring or actions taken on the Closing Date but
after the Closing by the Purchaser or by, or with respect to, any Target
Company that are outside the ordinary course of business and not expressly
contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as occurring after the Closing
Date; provided, further, however, for the avoidance of doubt, all Transaction
Expenses shall be allocated to the period ending on the Closing Date to the
extent permitted under applicable Law. Without the prior written consent of
the Seller Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or
permit any of its Affiliates to, amend any Tax Returns for any taxable period
ending on or before or including the Closing Date, or make or change and
material Tax election for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date not expressly contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall not amend the Companys final Form 1065.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser shall be responsible for any Transfer Taxes imposed under
Irish Law. All other Transfer Taxes, if any, shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers. From and after
the Closing, the Purchaser shall file or cause the Target Companies to file
all required Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, and if required by
applicable Law or to the extent reasonably requested, the Sellers shall
cooperate in the preparation and filing and join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation.

 



 

(d) The Sellers, at the Sellers sole cost and expense, shall (i) prepare and
timely file or cause to be filed (A) all Tax Returns of the Target Companies
that are due prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Returns_ ") and (B)
all required U.S. federal and applicable state Income Tax Returns for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period of those Target Companies for which the items of income,
deductions, credits, gains or losses are passed through to the Sellers under
applicable Law that are due after the Closing Date, including the final Form
1065 for the Company for the period ending on the Closing Date (the " _Flow-
Thru Returns_ " and, together with the Pre-Closing Returns, the " _Seller
Prepared Returns_ ") and (ii) timely pay all Taxes that are shown as payable
with respect to any Seller Prepared Returns. All Seller Prepared Returns
shall be prepared in accordance with existing procedures, practices, and
accounting methods of the Target Companies, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law. Each Seller Prepared Return

 



      
 

 



 

shall be submitted to Purchaser for Purchasers review and comment at least
twenty (20) days prior to the due date of such Seller Prepared Return (taking
into account extensions). The Sellers shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments made by Purchaser in such Seller Prepared Return prior to
filing.

 



 

(e) The Purchaser shall cause the applicable Target Company to prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns of the Target Companies (other than the Seller
Prepared Returns) for the taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date or a Straddle Period that are due after the Closing Date (the "
_Purchaser Prepared Returns_ "). Each Purchaser Prepared Return shall be
submitted to the Sellers for the Sellers review and comment at least twenty
(20) days prior to the due date of such Purchaser Prepared Return (taking into
account extensions). The Purchaser shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments made by the Sellers in such Purchaser Prepared Return
prior to filing. The Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser those Taxes shown on
any Purchaser Prepared Return (and with respect to any Tax Returns for any
Straddle Period, Taxes allocated to Sellers in a manner consistent with
_Section 5.9(f)_) no later than five (5) Business Days before the Purchaser
is required to file such Purchaser Prepared Returns with the applicable
Governmental Authority (taking into account any extensions timely filed by the
applicable Target Company), except to the extent the amount of any such Taxes
was included as a Current Liability in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital, as finally determined.

 



 

(f) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes of the Target
Companies (i) based on or measured by income or receipts, sales or use,
employment, or withholding for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or
other pass-through entity in which the Company holds a beneficial interest
shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and (ii) the amount of other Taxes
of the Target Companies for a Straddle Period for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period prior to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. Notwithstanding anything
in the foregoing to the contrary, any Taxes relating to or resulting from any
transaction occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the
ordinary course of business (other than as explicitly contemplated by this
Agreement) shall be deemed to arise after the end of the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) The Purchaser shall notify Seller Representative within thirty (30) days
upon the receipt of any notice, or becoming aware, of any audit or Proceeding
with respect to Taxes for which the Sellers would reasonably be expected to be
liable pursuant to this Agreement (a " _Tax Contest_ "); _provided however_ ,
that no failure or delay of the Purchaser in providing such notice shall
reduce or otherwise affect the obligations of the Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement, except to the extent that the Sellers are materially and adversely
prejudiced as a result of such failure or delay. The Purchaser shall control,
or cause the applicable Target Company to control, the conduct of any Tax
Contest; _provided_ , that if a Tax Contest relates solely to a Flow-Thru
Return, the Seller Representative shall have the right to assume control, at
Sellers expense, of such Tax Contest if within ten (10) days of receiving
notice of the Tax Contest, the Seller Representative notifies the Purchaser of
its intent to take control of such Tax Contest. If the Seller Representative
does not elect to control such Tax Contest, or for any other

 



      
 

 



 

Tax Contest that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Purchaser shall
control such Tax Contest; _provided_ , that (x) Seller Representative, at
Sellers cost and expense, shall have the right to participate in any such Tax
Contest, including without limitation, appointing a person selected by the
Seller Representative to be included on any power of attorney with a right to
receive all correspondence and attend all meetings (telephonic and in person)
and hearings with a taxing authority; and (y) the Purchaser shall not settle
any such Tax Contest without the Seller Representatives written consent, not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the Seller
Representative is given a reasonable period of time to consider the terms of
any proposed settlement. To the extent that the provisions of this _Section
5.9(g)_ conflict with the provisions of _Section 7.8_, this _Section 5.9(g)_
shall control.

 



 

(h) The parties shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon
written request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to the Target Companies, and their respective assets and activities,
as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return (including the
filing of the Companys final IRS Form 1065 by the Sellers under _Section
5.9(d)_), the determination of any Tax liability or benefit or, subject to
_Article VII_, the participation in any Proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such information and assistance shall include providing access to books and
records; providing copies of relevant Tax Returns and related work papers; and
making employees reasonably available, on a mutually convenient basis during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to provide explanations of
any documents or information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.9(h)_. The
Purchaser shall retain or cause to be retained in its possession or in the
possession of its Affiliates all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Target Companies and their respective assets and activities
that relate to any taxable period ending on or before or including the Closing
Date, until the later of (i) the expiration of the applicable period for
assessment under applicable Law (giving effect to any and all extensions or
waivers) and (ii) seven (7) years following the due date (without extension)
of the applicable Tax Return, and shall abide by, or cause to be abided by,
all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority
with respect to Taxes.

 



 

(i) _Section 338 Election_.

 



 

(i) The Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Target Companies), to make or cause to be
made an election under Code Section 338 or Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-3 (or any state, local or foreign Law or regulation analogous or
similar to such section of the Code or the Treasury Regulations), with respect
to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or with respect to any
Target Company effective for, or during, any Tax year of any Target Company in
which the Closing occurs. Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall not
directly or indirectly permit any Company Subsidiary that is a CFC to enter
into, participate in, or be the subject of (or be deemed to enter into,
participate in, or be the subject of) any distribution, election, or
transaction outside the ordinary course of business that may increase the
amount included in income under Code Section 951(a) (or any successor
provision or any state, local or foreign Law or regulation analogous or
similar to such section of the Code) by any Seller or any direct or indirect
equity holder of a Seller. Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall not
directly or indirectly permit any Company Subsidiary that is a CFC to enter
into, participate in, or be the subject of

 



      
 

 



 

(or be deemed to enter into, participate in, or be the subject of) any
distribution, election, or transaction outside the ordinary course of business
that may affect the earnings and profits of the Company Subsidiary without the
written consent of Seller Representative, which consent may be given or
withheld in Seller Representatives sole discretion. With respect to each such
Company Subsidiary, within thirty (30) days of the end of the Tax year in
which the Closing occurs, the Purchaser shall provide Seller Representative
with access to such Company Subsidiarys books and records and shall furnish
Seller Representative with information sufficient to permit each Seller (or
its direct or indirect equity holders) to calculate their Tax liabilities
resulting from the activities of such Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(ii) The Purchaser and the Seller Representative agree to cooperate and work
together in good faith prior to the Closing Date to determine whether any
adjustments can be made to the transaction structure that would be beneficial
to Purchaser or the Sellers and that would not adversely affect Purchaser or
any Seller or any direct or indirect equity holder of a Seller, including by
analyzing structural alternatives for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If, and only if, the Purchaser and each Seller agree that any such
adjustments can be made without adversely affecting Purchaser or any Seller or
any direct or indirect equity holder of a Seller, then they may mutually agree
to pursue such adjustments notwithstanding the provisions of _Section
5.9(i)(i)_. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this _Section 5.9(i)(ii)_
shall be deemed to require or otherwise obligate Purchaser or any Seller or
any equity holder of a Seller to consider or undertake any change to the
structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including as
contemplated in _Section 5.9(i)(i)_, and neither Purchaser nor any Seller
shall have any obligation whatsoever under this _Section 5.9(i)(ii)_ unless
it determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the proposed
adjustment would not result in any additional cost or other adverse
consequence to it.

 



 

(j) The Sellers will be entitled to all refunds, credits for overpayment of
Taxes or reductions of Tax of the Target Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period. If the Purchaser or any Target Company receives any refund, credit
for overpayment of Taxes or benefit from any reduction in Tax to which the
Sellers are entitled pursuant to this _Section 5.9(j)_, the Purchaser or the
applicable Target Company will promptly pay the amount of such refund
(including interest received from a taxing authority thereon), credit or
reduction in Tax to the Sellers, net of the amount of any Taxes and out-of-
pocket expenses that the Purchaser, the applicable Target Company or any
Affiliate thereof incur with respect to such refund, credit or reduction in
Taxes. In the event that any Tax refund or credit is subsequently determined
by any taxing authority to be less than the amount paid by the Purchaser, the
applicable Target Company or any of their Affiliates to the Sellers pursuant
to this _Section 5.9(j)_, the Seller shall promptly return any such
disallowed amount (plus any interest or penalties in respect of such
disallowed amount owed to any taxing authority) to the Purchaser.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.9(j)_ shall require
that the Purchaser, any Target Company or any of their Affiliates make any
payment with respect to any Tax refund (and such refund shall be for the
benefit of the Purchaser) that is with respect to (i) any refund that is the
result of the carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute
or Tax credit incurred in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date, (ii) any refund resulting from the Purchasers payment
of Taxes on or after the Closing Date where the Sellers have not borne or
provided

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification for such Taxes, (iii) any refund that gives rise to a payment
obligation by the Target Companies to any Person under applicable Law or
pursuant to a provision of a Contract or other agreement entered (or assumed)
by the Target Companies on or prior to the Closing Date or (iv) any refund
that is reflected as a Current Asset in the Closing Working Capital, as
finally determined.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
cause the Target Companies to, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and the respective Organizational Documents of the Target
Companies as in effect on the date of this Agreement, maintain the existing
exculpation, indemnification and related advancement of expenses provisions of
such Organizational Documents of the Target Companies with respect to each
director or officer or former director or officer of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Indemnified Directors and Officers_
"); _provided_ that if any claim or claims are asserted or made within such
period, all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until final disposition
of such claim or claims. In the event any Target Company fails to make any
payment when due under the provisions referred to in this _Section 5.10(a)_,
the Purchaser shall make, or cause to be made, such payment. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Indemnified Directors and Officers shall be
entitled to indemnification or exculpation or advancement of expenses pursuant
to this _Section 5.10_ to the extent any Purchaser Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_ except, and solely, to
the extent of any payments made directly from the insurers under the DandO Tail
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, after payment of any applicable deductible
thereunder).

 



 

(b) Contemporaneously with the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company
to, and the Company shall, purchase and maintain in effect a "tail" insurance
policy providing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the
benefit of the Indemnified Directors and Officers with respect to matters
occurring on or before the Closing Date on substantially similar terms to the
directors and officers liability insurance policy or policies maintained by
any Target Company as of the date of this Agreement (including coverage
amounts and limitations) (the " _D andO Tail_"); _provided_ that the Purchaser
shall not be required to pay for such "tail" insurance policy an annual
premium in excess of 250% of the Target Companies aggregate current annual
premium for directors and officers insurance policy (the " _Premium Cap_ "),
and to the extent the annual premium for such DandO Tail would exceed the
Premium Cap, the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Company to maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a
period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date for the Indemnified
Directors and Officers, a directors and officers insurance policy with the
best overall terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage reasonably
available for an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap; _provided further,
however_ , that the Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous
to the beneficiaries thereof so long as such substitution does not result in
gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The covenants set forth in this _Section 5.10_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Directors and
Officers and his or her respective heirs and legal representatives, and each
of the Indemnified Directors and Officers shall be third party beneficiaries
of this Agreement, with the right to enforce the provisions of this _Section
5.10_ against the Parties.

 



 

(d) If, after the Closing, the Purchaser, any Target Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns shall: (i) merge or consolidate with or merge
into any other Person, or otherwise enter into any business combination with
any other Person, and shall not be the surviving or continuing Person of such
merger, consolidation or business combination; or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its respective properties and assets to any Person, then
in each such case, the Purchaser shall take all necessary actions to ensure
that the successors or assigns of the Purchaser or any Target Company shall
assume all of the obligations of their predecessors set forth in this _Section
5.10_.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Special Indemnified Matter_. Following the Closing the Sellers
may assume and pursue the prosecution and defense of the Special Indemnified
Matter at their own expense and with counsel selected by the Seller
Representative and reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser may assume the defense of the Special Indemnified
Matter if a party to such Special Indemnified Matter demands injunctive or
other equitable relief that, if granted, would have a material and adverse
effect on the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses. During any period in which the Sellers are prosecuting and
defending the Special Indemnified Matter the Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense or prosecution of the Special Indemnified Matter,
including the retention and (upon the Seller Representatives request) the
provision to the Seller Representative of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Special Indemnified Matter, and making employees
and other representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Sellers shall not settle the Special Indemnified Matter without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); unless (A) the compromise or settlement
does not involve any statement, finding or admission of any fault of, or
violation of Law by, the Purchaser or the Target Companies, (B) the sole
relief provided to any third party in the compromise or settlement is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Sellers and does not include any
requirement that the Purchaser or the Target Companies take or refrain from
taking any actions other than compliance with any non-disclosure obligations
related to the terms of such settlement contained in the settlement agreement,
(C) the compromise or settlement includes an unconditional and irrevocable
release of the Purchaser or the Target Companies with respect to the subject
matter of the Special Indemnified Matter, (D) the settlement agreement
includes a reasonable confidentiality obligation by any third party claimant
of the terms of the settlement and (E) the Purchaser or one of the Target
Companies is a party to, or an express third party beneficiary of, the
settlement agreement, entitled to enforce such settlement agreement. The
Purchaser and the Target Companies shall have no Liability with respect to any
compromise or settlement of the Special Indemnified Matter made without its
consent (if such consent is required by this _Section 5.11_), and any such
compromise or settlement shall be void. Any monetary relief paid to the
Purchaser or the Target Companies in connection with the prosecution or
settlement of the Special Indemnified Matter shall be paid by or on behalf of
the

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser to the Seller Representative within two (2) Business Days after it
is received by the Purchaser or any of its representatives or Affiliates, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 



 

Section 5.12 _No Solicitation_. During the Pre-Closing Period, no Seller
shall, and the Sellers shall cause the Company, Seller Representative and each
of the Company Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate, encourage, entertain, facilitate or participate in any inquiries,
proposals or offers from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any information
to, or enter into any letter of intent, term sheet or Contract with, any
Person (other than the Purchaser), in each case relating to (a) any sale,
assignment or transfer of any of the Shares or any direct interest therein,
(b) any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination or other
similar transaction involving a Seller or any of the Target Companies, (c) any
sale of any assets or properties of any of the Target Companies outside of the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices or (d) any issue by
any of the Target Companies of any capital stock or other equity securities,
or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
(including any rights, warrants or options to acquire) any such capital stock,
other equity securities or other securities, (any such transaction referred to
in the preceding clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d), an " _Alternative Transaction_
"). If, during the Pre-Closing Period, any Seller or any of the Company
Representatives (including Seller Representative) receives any inquiry, offer
or proposal concerning a proposed Alternative Transaction, such Seller shall
not (and shall cause the Target Companies and the Company Representative
(including the Seller Representative) to not) make any written or oral
response to such inquiry, offer or proposal (other than to state that a
contractual obligation precludes a substantive response) and shall provide
written notice to the Purchaser, promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) of receipt of such inquiry, offer or proposal by such Seller,
any Target Companies or any of the Company Representatives (including the
Seller Representative), which notice shall include a reasonably detailed
description of the material terms and conditions of the proposed Alternative
Transaction (including the identity of the Person making the inquiry, offer or
proposal) and copies of all documents supplied by such Person in connection
with the proposed Alternative Transaction. The Sellers shall, and shall cause
the Target Companies and the Company Representatives (including the Seller
Representative) to, cease immediately any discussions regarding any potential
Alternative Transactions that were ongoing as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Purchaser Obligations in Respect of the Debt Financings_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
reasonably advisable or proper to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all terms,
conditions, representations and warranties applicable to the Purchaser set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter that are within its control, (ii) maintain
in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions (including any
"flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or enforce its
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter (including in the event that all
conditions to the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied, using its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources and the other
Persons providing such Debt Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt
Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated herein (which
shall not include taking enforcement

 



      
 

 



 

action) to cause such Debt Financing Sources and the other Persons providing
such Debt Financing to fund such Debt Financing), (iii) timely prepare the
necessary offering documents and materials, including prospectuses, private
placement memoranda, information memoranda and packages, lender and investor
presentations, rating agency presentations, and similar documents and
materials, in connection with the Debt Financing and (iv) consummate the Debt
Financing at the Closing (including, if necessary, pursuant to any "flex"
provisions); __provided_ , _however__ , that if funds in the amounts and on
the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter become unavailable to the
Purchaser on the terms and conditions set forth therein (including pursuant to
any "flex" provisions), the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain alternative debt financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in amounts
and otherwise on terms and conditions not substantially less favorable in the
aggregate (and with respect to the Debt Financing Conditions, no less
favorable) to the Purchaser than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any "flex" provisions); __provided_ ,_ that if the Purchaser
proceeds with Alternative Financing, it shall be subject to the same
obligations as set forth in this _Section 5.13(a)_ with respect to the Debt
Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, all references herein to the Debt
Financing shall be deemed to include the Alternative Financing, if any, and
all references to Debt Financing Sources, Debt Financing Sources Related
Parties, Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Financing Conditions shall be deemed
to refer to the equivalent concepts under the Alternative Financing. For the
further avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing under this
Agreement for the Purchaser to obtain the Financing or any alternative
financing.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser shall keep the Company and Seller Representative reasonably
and promptly apprised of material developments relating to the Debt Financing
and shall give the Company and Seller Representative prompt written notice of
any material adverse change with respect to such Debt Financing, including
prompt written notice (i) of any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time,
would constitute such a breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letter, (ii) if and when the Purchaser becomes aware that any portion of the
Debt Financing may not be available to consummate the funding of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) of the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect to
any (x) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter or (y) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, and (iv) of any
expiration or termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall keep the Company and Seller Representative
informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to the Company and
Seller Representative executed copies of the definitive documents related to
the Debt Financing and copies of any of the written notices or communications
described in the preceding sentence; _provided_ , that none of the Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to disclose (x)
ordinary course negotiations of the terms of the Debt Financing, or (y) any
information to the extent that (1) such information is subject to attorney-
client or similar privilege (but only if such privilege is asserted in good
faith) or (2) the disclosure of which would be prohibited or restricted by
applicable Law. The Purchaser shall not replace, amend or waive the Debt
Commitment Letter (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any provision of the
fee letter or the engagement letter) without the Companys prior written
consent if such replacement, amendment or waiver (A) reduces the aggregate or
net amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of

 



      
 

 



 

fees to be paid or original issue discount thereof) or amends the Debt
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the Closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing less
likely to occur; provided that, without the Companys prior written consent,
the Purchaser may amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements to add lenders,
lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had
not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (but
not make any other changes), but only if the addition of such additional
parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in any reduction
of the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing or
similar fee), (B) impose new or additional conditions, including amending the
Debt Financing Conditions, or otherwise expand or adversely amend any
conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing, (C) prevent or materially
delay the Closing, (D) adversely impact the likelihood of the funding of the
Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) or (E) adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the ability
of the Purchaser to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Purchaser shall provide to the Company and Seller Representative copies of
any commitment letter associated with an Alternative Financing as well as any
amendment or waiver of any debt commitment letter (including the Debt
Commitment Letter) that is permitted hereunder.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Company Obligations in Respect of the Debt Financing_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
(and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable
best efforts) to provide to the Purchaser, and shall use each of their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, employees and
advisors to provide to the Purchaser, such commercially reasonable and
customary cooperation reasonably requested by the Purchaser in connection with
arranging and obtaining the Debt Financing (which Debt Financing shall for the
purposes of this _Section 5.14(a)_ be deemed to include one or more offerings
of customary "high yield" non-convertible debt securities to be issued or
incurred in lieu of any bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter or pursuant to any market flex or securities demand provisions in the
related fee letter) (or, if applicable, any Alternative Financing)
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (provided that such requested
cooperation is consistent with applicable Law and does not unduly interfere
with the operations of the Target Companies), including using reasonable best
efforts in connection with (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable,
preparing and furnishing the Purchaser the Company Financing Information as
and when it becomes available, (ii) participating in a reasonable number of

sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection
with the Debt Financing, in each case at reasonable times and locations to be
mutually agreed with reasonable advance notice, (iii) assisting the Purchaser
with the preparation by the Purchaser of (A) offering documents and
confidential information memoranda for any portion of the Debt Financing and
(B) reasonable and customary materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda and similar documents reasonably and customarily
required in connection with the Debt Financing (including the delivery of any
consents of accountants for use of their reports); _provided, however_ , that
any offering

 



       
 

 



 

memorandum, offering documents, confidential information memorandum, rating
agency presentations, bank information memoranda or similar documents required
in connection with the Debt Financing shall contain disclosure reflecting the
Purchaser as the obligor(s) other than as set forth in the customary
representation letters to the Companys accountants as contemplated by clause
(v) below, (iv) assisting with the pledging of collateral (it being understood
that no such pledging of collateral will be effective until at or after the
Closing) and obtaining any necessary intercreditor agreements solely to the
extent required by the Debt Financing Sources in the Debt Commitment Letter to
be in effect at Closing (including, without limitation, if so required, any
intercreditor agreement or subordination, non-disturbance and attornment
required to be delivered in connection with the Microsoft Documents), (v)
obtaining customary accountants comfort letters (including customary
"negative assurance" comfort) (including the delivery of customary
authorization letters and representation letters to the Companys accountants

Company as is reasonably requested in connection with the Debt Financing that
relates to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA Patriot Act; _provided, however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (A)
irrespective of the above, nothing in this _Section 5.14(a)_ shall require
the Company or any of the Target Companies to incur any liability or enter
into any binding certificate, agreement, document or instrument (or to take
any action under any certificate, agreement document or instrument) that is
not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Closing (other than certain authorization letters or representation letters
described in the immediately preceding clause (v)), (B) nothing in this
Agreement (including this _Section 5.14(a)_) shall require such cooperation
or actions to the extent it would (x) interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of any Target Company, (y) require the Company or any of the
Target Companies to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the Companys or any Target
Companys charter document or bylaws or other comparable organizational
documents, any Applicable Laws or violate any Material Contract which
violation results in a Lien on the property of the Target Companies, or (z)
require the Target Companies to provide any solvency or other similar
certificate of the chief financial officer or similar representative of any
Target Company, (C) the Company shall not be required to issue any offering
document, (D) nothing in this _Section 5.14(a)_ shall require the Sellers,
Seller Representative or the Company to make any representation or warranty,
or incur any liability, in connection with the Debt Financing or the marketing
or arrangement thereof (except, in the case of the Company, any such
representation or warranty that is effective only at or following the Closing
or, solely to the extent necessary to be delivered to the accountants of the
Company in connection with any comfort letters with respect to the Company
Financing Information and other financial information of the Company required
hereunder), (E) the Company shall not be required to prepare or deliver any
financial statements or other financial information or data under this
_Section 5.14(a)_ other than the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Financing Information (provided, that the Company and the Target
Companies shall have no obligation to prepare or provide any projections or
information in connection with the potential purchase price accounting
treatment of the Share Purchase, provided that none of the following shall be
considered Company Financing Information and the Company shall have no
obligation to provide any such information: (1) any post-Closing or pro forma
cost savings, capitalization and other post-Closing or (and the assumptions
relating thereto) desired by the Purchaser to be reflected in such pro forma
data, (2) any projections or any information in connection with the potential
purchase price accounting treatment of the Share Purchase, (3) in the case of
clause (iv) of the definition of Company Financing Information, any other
information concerning the assumptions underlying the post-Closing or pro
forma adjustments to be made in such pro forma adjustments or (4) in the case
of clause (iv) of the definition of Company Financing Information, any
adjustments to any pro forma financial information required to be provided in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, (F) prior to the Closing, neither
the Companys board of directors nor any of the Target Companies boards of
directors (or equivalent bodies with respect to foreign Subsidiaries) shall be
required to approve or adopt any Financing or agreements related thereto (or
any Alternative Financing) and (G) no personal liability shall be imposed on
the officers, directors, managers, employers or agents of the Company or any
of the Target Companies.

 



 

(b) In addition to the requirements contained in _Section 5.14(a)_, in the
event that the Purchaser is required, in connection with the Debt Financing,
to order (or make available) title reports or similar materials regarding any
parcel of Company Owned Real Property, the Sellers and the Company shall
cooperate with (and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
cooperate with) the Purchaser and any applicable title companys efforts to
produce such reports or materials. Further, the Sellers and the Company shall
(and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) use their reasonable
best efforts to assist the Purchaser in efforts to obtain title insurance
policies with regard to any of the Owned Real Property in connection with the
Debt Financing, including by providing customary affidavits, indemnities and
similar instruments reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(c) The Company shall not be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or make any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or
incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in
connection with the Debt Financing or any of the foregoing that would be
effective prior to the Closing or would be treated as a Transaction Expense.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.14_, the Target
Companies shall not be required to undertake any obligation or execute any
agreement (other than authorization letters in connection with syndication
efforts) that would be effective prior to the Closing, or deliver, or cause to
be delivered, any legal opinion by its counsel (other than by using
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Purchaser in obtaining local
counsel opinions) or corporate authorizations or approvals (including board or
shareholder resolutions). The Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the
Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the cooperation of the
Company and its Affiliates contemplated by this _Section 5.14_ (the "
_Financing Cooperation Costs_ ") and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Affiliates and their respective representatives from and against
any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information
provided or

 



      
 

 



 

used in connection therewith, except in the event such losses arose out of or
resulted from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any such Person
except to the extent such losses arose out of or resulted from the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of any such Persons. All information provided
by the Company or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that the Purchaser shall
be permitted to disclose such information to the sources of the Debt
Financing, rating agencies and prospective lenders during syndication of the
Debt Financing subject to the sources of the Debt Financing, ratings agencies
and prospective lenders entering into customary confidentiality undertakings
with respect to such information.

 



 

(d) The Company hereby consents to the reasonable and customary use of the
Target Companies names, marks and logos in connection with the Debt
Financing; _provided,_ that such names, marks and logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended or not reasonably likely to harm, disparage or
otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of the Target Companies or the
reputation and goodwill of the Company or any of the Target Companies. The
Purchaser hereby agrees that any products, materials or other items
(regardless of the form or media) that bear the Target Companies names, marks
and logos shall include, as applicable, ® or  as is customary or required
under applicable Law or as otherwise requested by the Sellers or the Company.

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser acknowledges that it is not a
condition to Closing under this Agreement for the Purchaser to obtain the Debt
Financing or any alternative financing.

 



 

Section 5.15 _WARN Act_. On or before the Closing Date, Seller Representative
shall deliver, or cause the Company to deliver, to the Purchaser a list of
each employee of the Target Companies terminated during the ninety (90) day
period preceding the Closing Date in any jurisdiction in which the WARN Act is
applicable (or within any other relevant period under any similar Law in any
jurisdiction in which the Target Companies operate). In reliance on such
information (a) the Purchaser and the Target Companies will comply fully, if
applicable, with the WARN Act and all other applicable Laws, including those
prohibiting discrimination and requiring notice to employees, in any
termination or layoff of any employees by the Purchaser or the Target
Companies on or after the Closing and (b) the Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause the Target Companies not to, at any time prior to ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms
are defined in the WARN Act affecting in whole or in part any facility, site
of employment, operating unit or employee of the Target Companies without
complying fully with the requirements of the WARN Act. The Purchaser and the
Target Companies will bear the cost of compliance with (or failure to comply
with) any such Laws unless the cost of such compliance would not have been
incurred if the information provided to the Purchaser pursuant to the first
sentence of this _Section 5.15_ was correct, in which case the Sellers will
bear the cost of such compliance.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Restrictive Covenants of the Sellers_.

 



 

(a) _General Acknowledgement_. Each Seller agrees and acknowledges that (i)
the Target Companies have spent and will continue to spend substantial money,
time and

 



      
 

 



 

effort in developing and solidifying their relationships with the customers,
suppliers, vendors and payors of the Target Companies and in maintaining and
developing the Confidential Information of the Target Companies, (ii) long-
term relationships with customers, suppliers, vendors and payors often can be
difficult to develop and require a significant investment of time, effort and
expense, (iii) the Purchaser is acquiring the Target Companies and agreeing to
pay the Purchase Price based upon (A) the business information, customer,
supplier, vendor and payor goodwill of the Target Companies, (B) the loyalty
of the customers, suppliers, vendors and payors of the Target Companies and
(C) the customer, supplier, vendor and payor contacts of the Target Companies
and (iv) the Purchaser would not enter into this Agreement without the
Sellers agreement to the covenants set forth in this _Section 5.15_.
Accordingly, as a material inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each Seller on behalf of itself and not the other Seller hereby agrees to the
following provisions of this _Section 5.15._

 



 

(b) _Confidentiality_. Until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
such Seller shall not, and shall cause each of such Sellers Affiliates to
not, at any time after the Closing, disclose to any Person or use for any
purpose any Confidential Information; _provided, however_ , that such Seller
and such Sellers Affiliates may make such disclosures of Confidential
Information (i) as are required under applicable Law, in each case as long as
such Person (A) provides reasonable advance notice to the extent practical and
legally permissible of such requirement to the Purchaser so that the Purchaser
may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, (B) reasonably
cooperates with the Purchaser at Purchasers expense to obtain an appropriate
protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment shall
be accorded to such information and (C) discloses only such information as
such Person is advised by outside legal counsel in writing that such Person is
legally required to disclose or (ii) as permitted by or as necessary for
purposes of exercising such Persons rights or remedies under this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents to which such Person is a party or any other written
agreement between such Person and the Purchaser or the Target Companies. The
Purchaser acknowledges that: (1) the Sellers and certain of their Affiliates
make investments in companies in the ordinary course of business, and, as a
result of such investments, such companies may be deemed to be affiliated or
associated with the Sellers and such Affiliates; (2) certain other Persons
that may be deemed to be directly or indirectly affiliated or associated with
a Seller represent institutions over which such Seller has no or limited
control; and (3) the Sellers and their Affiliates ownership of the Target
Companies has served to give the Sellers and their Affiliates increased
knowledge and understanding of the Target Companies industry and business in
a way that cannot be reasonably expected to be forgotten or separated from the
Sellers and their Affiliates overall knowledge base. Therefore,
notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.15_ to the contrary, the
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, agrees that, (x) to the
extent a Seller has not disclosed and does not disclose, directly or
indirectly (including through one or more of its Affiliates), any Confidential
Information to, and has not used and does not use Confidential Information for
the benefit of such affiliated companies or other Persons in violation of this
_Section 5.15_, none of the terms of this _Section 5.15_ shall apply to such
affiliated companies or other Persons, and (y) without in any way limiting the
obligations of the Sellers under this Agreement, the Sellers will not be
deemed to be in breach of this _Section 5.16(b)_ by reason of remembering,
retaining, and using in their business their increased knowledge as described
in item (3) of the preceding sentence.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Non-Solicitation of Business Relations_. Such Seller shall not, and shall
cause each of such Sellers Restricted Affiliates to not, directly or
indirectly, at any time during the Restricted Period: (a) solicit, attempt to
solicit, or assist any other Person to solicit or attempt to solicit any
business from any Person who is a customer of any of the Target Companies as
of the Closing Date or who was a customer of any of the Target Companies at
any time during the six (6) month period preceding the Closing Date or (b)
take any action that is intended to discourage any Person who is or has been
within the past six (6) months a lessor, licensor, customer, supplier,
licensee, subcontractor or other business associate or relation of any of the
Target Companies in connection with the Target Companies business prior to
the Closing Date from entering into or maintaining, or to terminate, cease or
otherwise adversely change, its relationship with any of the Target Companies
or in any other way deliberately interfere with the relationship between any
of the Target Companies, on the one hand, and any such lessor, licensor,
customer, supplier, licensee, subcontractor or other business associate or
relation, on the other hand.

 



 

(d) _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. Each Seller shall not, and shall cause
each of such Sellers Restricted Affiliates to not, at any time during the
Restricted Period, directly or indirectly, solicit or attempt to solicit for
employment or attempt to hire or engage or in any other way induce or attempt
to induce to leave the employ of or engagement by any of the Target Companies,
any individual who is, on the Closing Date or who was, during the six (6)
month period preceding the Closing Date, a manager, officer, director (or
equivalent), employee or Contractor (in this case limited to Contractors who
are either individuals or where the services to the Target Companies, or any
of them, of a particular individual on behalf of such Contractor are
contemplated) to any of the Target Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
general advertisement or general solicitation for employment not targeted to
the managers, officers, directors (or the equivalent position with respect to
foreign Subsidiaries), employees or consultants of the Target Companies shall
be deemed to be in violation of this _Section 5.16(d)_; _and provided,
further_ , that this _Section 5.16(d)_ shall not apply to any such Persons
from and after such date, if any, that their employment or engagement with the
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Target Companies) is
terminated other than for cause.

 



 

(e) _Appropriate Restrictions; Authority for Judicial Enforcement and
Revision_. Such Seller agrees and acknowledges that the covenants of such
Seller set forth in this _Section 5.15_ (i) are reasonable in duration,
geographic scope, area and nature of restrictions and in all other respects
and (ii) have been made in order to induce the Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and the
Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement or consummated the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case but for the covenants of the
Sellers contained in this _Section 5.15_, which are necessary to protect the
goodwill, trade secrets and business of the Target Companies. If, at any time
of enforcement of any of the provisions of this _Section 5.15_ a Governmental
Authority determines that the duration, geographic scope or area or nature of
restrictions stated in this Agreement are not enforceable under applicable
Law, the parties agree that the maximum duration, geographic scope and area or
nature of restrictions (as applicable) permitted by applicable Law shall be
substituted for the duration, geographic scope and area or nature of
restrictions (as applicable) stated herein and the Governmental Authority
shall be authorized by the parties to revise the restrictions contained herein
to cover such maximum duration, geographic scope and area or nature of
restrictions (as applicable). This _Section 5.16(e)_ shall be read in
conjunction with (and

 



      
 

 



 

not to the exclusion of) _Section 10.8_ (Severability), but in the event of
any conflict between the immediately preceding sentence of this _Section
5.16(e)_, on the one hand, and the first sentence of _Section 10.8_, on the
other hand, the immediately preceding sentence of this _Section 5.16(e)_ will
control and govern.

 



 

(f) _Injunctive Relief_. The parties agree that any breach or attempted breach
of this _Section 5.15_ would cause irreparable injury to the Purchaser, which
cannot be adequately compensated in monetary damages. Therefore, the Purchaser
shall have, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any of the other rights and
remedies available hereunder, the right to have the provisions of this
_Section 5.15_ specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction
by way of an injunction or other equitable relief. The Purchaser shall not be
required to post a bond or other security or to prove actual damages or the
inadequacy of monetary damages in connection with its efforts to obtain
equitable relief concerning this _Section 5.15_.

 



 

(g) _Non-Exclusive Obligations_. Each Seller agrees and acknowledges that such
Sellers obligations set forth in this _Section 5.15_ are in addition to, and
not in lieu of, any obligations such Seller has to any of the Target Companies
pursuant to any other Contract between such Seller and any of the Target
Companies or at common law.

claim of Excluded Fraud brought by a Purchaser Indemnified Party against such
Seller (but with respect to this clause (C), only (i) if such manager,

entitled to indemnification from the Purchaser or any Target Company as a

to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G. No later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser evidence (i) that a vote of the stockholders was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G, and (ii) either (A) the requisite stockholder

pursuant to Rules 144, 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act), and it
will take any such further action as reasonably requested to the extent
required from time to time to enable the holders of the Purchaser Stock to
sell the Purchaser Stock without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rules 144, 144A or Regulation
S under the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or
(ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the
reasonable request of a holder of the Purchaser Stock, Parent will deliver to
such stockholder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such
requirements and, if not, the specifics of any compliance deficits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be deemed a breach of this
_Section 5.20_ by Purchaser if Purchaser is late in making any required
filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act as a result of its audit
of the Companys and its Subsidiaries books and records following Closing.

 



 

Section 5.21 _Express Note; CVC Contract_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall determine the manner in which that certain Second

of May 31, 2016, by Hibernia Express Ireland and payable to the Company (the "
_Express Note_ ") and the repayment (or other satisfaction) of all amounts due
thereunder shall be terminated prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that the
Company shall deliver notice to the Purchaser of the proposed manner in which
the Express Note will be terminated no later than thirty (30) days prior to
the Closing and _provided further_ that no such termination shall have adverse
Tax consequences to the Purchaser or the post-closing Target Companies, or if
it does, the Sellers shall have the right

 



      
 

 



 

to compensate the Purchaser therefor. The Company and the Purchaser shall work
together in good faith to determine the manner in which the Express Note shall
be terminated prior to the Closing and the Company shall take no action with
respect to such termination without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(b) The Company may, but is not required to, cause the CVC Contract to be
terminated or amended prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that, no such
termination or amendment shall result in any adverse Tax consequences to the
Purchaser or the post-closing Target Companies, or if it does, the Sellers
shall have the right to compensate the Purchaser therefor. Nor shall it result
in the CVC Contract being materially worse for the Target Companies post-
Closing, without the Purchasers prior written consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld. In the event that the CVC Contract is not terminated or amended
appropriately in accordance herewith, then all Indebtedness arising under the
CVC Contract shall be paid in full at closing pursuant to a Payoff Letter
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.

received or, with respect to any Purchaser Required Consent from a
Governmental Authority, reasonably satisfactory written or oral notification
shall have been received from the applicable Governmental Authority that its
consent to the Closing is not required.

 



 

(e) There shall not be in effect any injunction or other Order restraining or
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE VII 
SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION; WAIVER AND RELEASE

 



 

Section 7.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Other
Agreements_.

 



 

(a) The respective representations, warranties and covenants of the Company,
the Sellers and the Purchaser in this Agreement shall survive until the end of
the Indemnification Escrow Period and shall thereupon expire (except to the
extent a Notice of Claim has been submitted with respect to such
representation or warranty prior to such date); _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_ (but not
the second sentence thereof); _Section 2.1(b)_, _Section 2.3_, _Section
2.4(a) _(but only the first two sentences thereof), _Section 2.22_, _Section
3.1_, _Section 3.3_, _Section 3.5_, _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.4_ and
_Section 4.11_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely and (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.15_ shall survive the
Closing and shall terminate on the sixtieth (60th) day after the running of
the applicable statute of limitations for the matters described in such
representations and warranties (except to the extent a Notice of Claim has
been submitted with respect to such representation or warranty prior to such
date) (the representations and warranties set forth in this _clause (ii)_ ,
collectively with the representations and warranties set forth in the
preceding _clause (i)_ , the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), (iii) this
_Section 7.1(a)_ shall not limit any covenant or other agreement that by its
terms is required to be performed after such Indemnification Escrow Period,
including for greater certainty _Sections 5.5(c)_ , _5.7_ , _5.8_ , _5.10_ ,
_5.12_ , _5.16_ , this _Article VII_ and _Article X_, which shall survive in
accordance with their terms, and (iv) the covenants set forth in _Section
5.9_ shall terminate on the sixtieth (60th) day after the running of the
applicable statute of limitations for the matters described in such covenants;
_provided further, however_ , that the covenants and agreements referred to in
_Section 7.2(b)(ii)_ and _(iii)_ shall survive until the end of the
Indemnification Escrow Period and shall thereupon expire (in each case for
this sentence,

 



      
 

 



 

except to the extent a Notice of Claim has been submitted with respect to such
covenant or agreement prior to such date).

 



 

(b) No claim for indemnification may be asserted against any of the parties
for a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or a breach of
any covenant or agreement made by or to be performed by a party set forth in
this Agreement or any of the matters referred to in _Section 7.2(b)(v)_
through _(vii)_ unless a Notice of Claim has been received by the Purchaser,
if the Purchaser is the Indemnifying Party, or by Seller Representative, if
either of the Sellers is the Indemnifying Party, prior to the date on which
such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other matter expires as
set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_; and if a Notice of Claim has been received by
the Purchaser, if the Purchaser is the Indemnifying Party, or by Seller
Representative, if either of the Sellers is the Indemnifying Party, prior to
the date on which such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other
matter expires as set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_, then the claim for
indemnification with respect to the matters set forth in such Notice of Claim
will survive until such later date as such claim for indemnification has been
fully and finally resolved in accordance with this _Article VII_. In
furtherance of the foregoing, upon expiration of the applicable survival
period set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_, any and all claims shall irrevocably
expire and be waived, except any claims properly brought before such time in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, this
will not limit the damages that can be asserted in a properly brought claim).
The Parties intend for the periods during which Parties may make claims
hereunder as set forth in in _Section 7.1(a)_ and _(b)_ to supersede any
otherwise applicable periods of time during which claims might otherwise be
available to the Parties with regard to the foregoing matters, whether
pursuant to applicable statutes of limitation or otherwise.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Indemnification Obligations_.

 



 

(a) [Intentionally omitted].

 



 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VII_, from and after the
Closing, the Sellers shall, severally in proportion to their respective Equity
Interest Percentages, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, and pay on behalf of and reimburse each of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of, any and all Losses incurred,
suffered, sustained, or required to be paid by or imposed upon, any Purchaser
Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or relating to: (i) the
breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty set forth in
_Article II_; (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement in which the Sellers agree to cause the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to take or not take some action; (iii) the breach of any
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement to be performed by the
Company prior to the Closing; (iv) the breach of any covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to be performed by
Seller Representative in its capacity as such; (v) any Indemnified Taxes, (vi)
any Closing Date Indebtedness that is not repaid in full at the Closing or
accounted for in the determination of the Final Closing Statement pursuant to
_Section 1.7_, (vii) any Seller Transaction Expenses that are outstanding
after the Closing and not accounted for in the determination of the Final
Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 1.7_ or (viii) the Special Indemnified
Matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, no
Seller

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party will be a Purchaser Indemnified Party by reason of such
Seller Indemnified Partys position with the Target Companies or otherwise.

 



 

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VII_, from and after the
Closing, each Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, and pay on behalf of and reimburse each of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of, any and all Losses incurred,
suffered, sustained, or required to be paid by or imposed upon, any Purchaser
Indemnified Party arising out of or resulting from: (i) the breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of such Seller set forth in
_Article III_; or (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of such Seller
set forth in this Agreement (other than those referred to in _Section
7.2(b)(ii)_) or any Seller Document.

 



 

(d) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VII_, from and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify defend and hold harmless each of the
Seller Indemnified Parties, and pay on behalf of and reimburse each of the
Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, any and all Losses incurred,
suffered, sustained, or required to be paid by, or imposed upon, any Seller
Indemnified Party arising out of or resulting from: (i) the breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the Purchaser set forth in
_Article IV_; or (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement or any Purchaser Document. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall indemnify each
of the Seller Indemnified Parties for any increase in Tax liability resulting
from any breach of _Section 5.9(i)_.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article VII_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event shall any Seller be required to
provide indemnification with respect to any claim for indemnification made
pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.2(c)(i)_: (i) if the Losses
associated with such claim (or group of related claims arising out of the same
or similar circumstances) are less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000)
(the " _De Minimis Claim Amount_ "); or (ii) unless and until the aggregate
dollar amount of all Losses of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for all such
claims that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(i)_
or _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ (but without giving effect to any Loss or Losses below
the De Minimis Claim Amount) exceeds One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($1,500,000) (the " _Indemnification Deductible_ "); _provided, however_ ,
that if the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the Indemnification
Deductible, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification for the full amount of all such Losses and not just the amount
in excess of the Indemnification Deductible; and _provided further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the De Minimis Claim Amount and the
Indemnification Deductible shall not apply to the Fundamental Representations
and, accordingly, any claims by a Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of a
Fundamental Representation of the Company or the Sellers shall be indemnified
hereunder from the first dollar of any applicable Losses.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article VII_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event shall any Seller be required to
provide indemnification (i) with respect to any claim for indemnification made
pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ (other than with
respect to the Fundamental Representations), in an amount exceeding such
Sellers allocable portion of the Indemnification Cap, determined by such
Sellers Equity Interest

 



      
 

 



 

Percentage; _provided, however_ , the Indemnification Cap shall not apply to
Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties as a result of
inaccuracies in or breaches of the Fundamental Representations of the Sellers,
which shall be excluded in calculating when the Indemnification Cap is
reached, (ii) with respect to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to
_Section 7.2(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ for any Losses suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties as a result of inaccuracies in or breaches of
the Fundamental Representations of the Sellers, in an amount exceeding such
Sellers allocable portion of Purchase Price, determined by such Sellers
Equity Interest Percentage and (iii) with respect to any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(v)_ through _(viii)_ , in an
amount exceeding such Sellers allocable portion of Purchase Price, determined
by such Sellers Equity Interest Percentage. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Indemnification Cap shall not apply to the matters referred to in _Section
7.2(b)(ii)_ through _(viii)_ or _Section 7.2(c)(ii)_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article VII_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement in no event shall the Purchaser be required to
provide indemnification with respect to any claim for indemnification made
pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)(i)_: (i) if the Losses associated with such claim
(or group of related claims arising out of the same or similar circumstances)
are less than the De Minimis Claim Amount; or (ii) unless and until the
aggregate dollar amount of all Losses of the Seller Indemnified Parties for
all such claims that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to _Section
7.2(c)(i)_ (but without giving effect to any Loss or Losses below the De
Minimis Claim Amount) exceeds the Indemnification Deductible; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the
Indemnification Deductible, the Seller Indemnified Parties shall only be
entitled to indemnification for the full amount of all such Losses and not
just the amount in excess of the Indemnification Deductible; and _provided
further_ , however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the De Minimis Claim
Amount and the Indemnification Deductible shall not apply to the Fundamental
Representations and, accordingly, any claims by a Seller Indemnified Party in
respect of a Fundamental Representation of the Purchaser shall be indemnified
hereunder from the first dollar of any applicable Losses.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article VII_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement in no event shall the Purchaser be required to
provide indemnification with respect to any claim for indemnification made
pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ in an amount exceeding the Indemnification
Cap; _provided, however_ , the Indemnification Cap shall not apply to Losses
suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties as a result of inaccuracies in or
breaches of the Fundamental Representations of the Purchaser, which shall be
excluded in calculating when such Indemnification Cap is reached and instead
shall be subject to a separate indemnification cap equal to the Purchase
Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnification Cap shall not apply to
the matters referred to in _Section 7.2(d)(ii)_.

 



 

(e) _Excluded Fraud_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that the preceding provisions of
this _Section 7.3_ shall not apply with respect to any Losses arising out of
or resulting from any action or inaction that constitutes Excluded Fraud (as
determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction), and that nothing in this Agreement shall limit (i) any partys
rights vis-a-vis the party committing such Excluded Fraud, or (ii) the amount
of Losses recoverable by a party against the party committing such Excluded
Fraud (as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.4 _Determination of Loss Amount; Reliance_.

 



 

(a) _Recourse Against Insurance_. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Target Companies to, in good faith, diligently seek recovery, at its or their
own expense (which shall be a Loss), of all insurance proceeds from insurers
with respect to all Losses with respect to which any Purchaser Indemnified
Party makes a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_. No
Indemnifying Party shall delay making any payment under this _Article VII_
pending resolution of any insurance claim. To the extent that the Purchaser or
the Target Companies receive any amount under insurance coverage with respect
to a matter for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party has previously obtained
payment in indemnification under this _Article VII_, the Purchaser shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such insurance proceeds, pay
and reimburse to the Escrow Agent (if such reimbursement is to be delivered
prior to the release of the Indemnification Escrow Funds) or to Seller
Representative (if such reimbursement is to be delivered after the release of
the Indemnification Escrow Funds), for any prior indemnification payment (up
to the amount of the insurance proceeds, less any premium increases directly
attributable thereto).

 



 

(b) _Mitigation_. Each of the Purchaser and, after the Closing, the Target
Companies shall make commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate the amount of
any Losses for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party, as applicable, makes a claim for indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(c) _No Double Recovery_. No Indemnified Party shall be able to recover any
Loss for which it is otherwise entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement if such Loss has already been taken into account in determining the
Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness (including Funded Debt), Seller
Transaction Expenses or Closing Working Capital in connection with
determination of the Final Closing Statement in accordance with _Section
1.7_. In addition, notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Party may
have the right to assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of
more than one provision of this Agreement in respect of any fact, event,
condition or circumstance, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
the amount of any Losses suffered by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
more than once, regardless of whether such Losses may be as a result of a
breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

(d) _Reliance_. The representations and warranties made by the Company and the
Sellers in _Articles II_ and _III_ , respectively, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser in _Article IV_, on the other hand, in this Agreement are made with
the knowledge and expectation that the Sellers are (in the case of
representations and warranties made by the Purchaser) and the Purchaser is (in
the case of representations and warranties made by the Company, the Sellers or
either of them) placing complete reliance thereon in entering into, and
performing its obligations under, this Agreement. No investigation made by or
for the benefit of a party, nor any knowledge of information held or obtained
by such party either in the course of such investigation or otherwise, shall
negate or limit the effect of the representations and warranties made for the
benefit of such party in this Agreement or any right to indemnification with
respect to any breach of or inaccuracy therein.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _No Exemplary or Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Article VII_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event
shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to receive indemnification under this
_Article VII_ for any Losses relating to exemplary or punitive damages;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this limitation shall not apply if, and solely
to the extent that, an Indemnified Party is seeking to obtain through
indemnification reimbursement of such Losses resulting from an award in a
Third Party Claim against such Indemnified Party of such Losses.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Indemnification Procedure  Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified
Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this _Article VII_ not involving
a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall provide to the Purchaser, if
the Purchaser is the Indemnifying Party, or to Seller Representative, if
either of the Sellers is the Indemnifying Party, notice of such claim, which
notice shall describe in reasonable detail, including the nature of the
matter, the basis for the claim that such matter is subject to indemnification
and, to the extent known, the amount and nature of the Losses purported to
result therefrom (a " _Notice of Direct Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure of an Indemnified Party to timely provide a Notice of Direct
Claim or to provide any particular details therein shall not relieve any
Indemnifying Party from any obligation to indemnify such Indemnified Party
except to the extent that such Indemnified Partys failure to provide or delay
in providing a Notice of Direct Claim or any detail required to be included
therein prejudices the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend against or
contest such matter. If the amount of Losses set forth in a Notice of Direct
Claim are estimated or not fully known at the time the Notice of Direct Claim
is delivered, the Indemnified Party shall from time to time notify the
Purchaser, if the Purchaser is the Indemnifying Party, or Seller
Representative, if either of the Sellers is the Indemnifying Party, of the
revised amount of Losses with respect to such indemnification claim as the
same are finally determined).

 



 

Section 7.6 _Indemnification Procedure  Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) With respect to any matter for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification from an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VII_ that
relates to a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall provide to the
Indemnifying Party notice describing such matter in reasonable detail and the
basis for the claim that such matter is subject to indemnification (a "
_Notice of Third Party Claim_ " and, together with a Notice of Direct Claim, a
" _Notice of Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of an
Indemnified Party to timely provide a Notice of Third Party Claim shall not
relieve any Indemnifying Party from any obligation to indemnify such
Indemnified Party except to the extent that such Indemnified Partys failure
to provide or delay in providing a Notice of Third Party Claim prejudices the
ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend against such matter.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and pursue the
defense of any claim or Proceeding by a third party for which any Indemnified
Party has provided a Notice of Third Party Claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ")
with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party upon delivery to the Indemnified Party, within thirty
(30) days after the notice of Third Party Claim has been delivered to the
Indemnifying Party, of an irrevocable acknowledgement and agreement that (i)
any Losses resulting therefrom are indemnifiable Losses for which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this _Article VII_
(subject to the limitations set forth in this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Article VII_) and (ii) that the Indemnifying Party shall post any bond or
other security to the extent required in connection with the defense or appeal
of such Third Party Claim (an " _Assumption of Defense Notice_ "); _provided_
that the Indemnifying Party shall have an additional sixty (60) days after the
delivery of such notice to revoke such acknowledgement and agreement with
respect to any portion of such Losses based on matters that become known to
the Indemnifying Party during such period and which indicate that such Losses
would not be indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification under this _Article VII_ (and if a notice of such
revocation is not delivered by the Indemnifying Party during such sixty (60)
day period, such Losses shall conclusively be deemed indemnifiable Losses).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim if (A) such Third Party Claim
involves a purported class action, (B) such Third Party Claim involves
criminal allegations, (C) such Third Party Claim demands injunctive or other
equitable relief that, if granted, would have an adverse effect on any of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or their respective businesses (if a Purchaser
Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Party) or any of the Seller Indemnified
Parties or their respective businesses (if a Seller Indemnified Party is the
Indemnified Party), (D) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the
Losses associated with such Third Party Claim are likely to exceed the then-
remaining amount of the Indemnification Cap, (E) the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines that it would be inappropriate for a single counsel to
represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in connection
with such Third Party Claim under applicable standards of legal ethics or (F)
there are legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(c) Unless and until the Indemnified Party receives, with respect to any Third
Party Claim, an Assumption of Defense Notice from the Indemnifying Party
within the thirty (30)-day period provided above or if, at any time after the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party fails diligently to defend such Third Party Claim (i) the
Indemnified Party may, but shall not be obligated to, fully assume, commence
and pursue its defense of such Third Party Claim in any such manner as it may
deem appropriate, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall thereafter promptly inform
the Indemnifying Party of all material developments related to such Third
Party Claim (including copying the Indemnifying Party on court filings and
correspondence); _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not be
obligated to turn over any attorney-client privileged information, (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of
such Third Party Claim, including the retention and (upon the Indemnified
Partys request) the provision to the Indemnified Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees and other representatives and advisors available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder and (iv) the Indemnified Party shall not
settle any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, any attorneys fees and
expenses and other costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with a Third Party Claim prior to the time at which such Third
Party Claim has been assumed by the Indemnifying Party as provided herein or
during any subsequent time in which the Indemnified Party is conducting its
own defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 7.6_
shall be Losses hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, it
shall control and direct the defense of such Third Party Claim, but the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. During any period in which the
Indemnifying Party is defending a Third Party Claim (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly inform the Indemnified Party of all material developments
related to such Third Party Claim (including copying the Indemnified Party on
court filings and correspondence) and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim,
including the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees and other
representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying
Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless (A) the compromise or settlement does not
involve any statement, finding or admission of any fault of, or violation of
Law by, the Indemnified Party, (B) the sole relief provided in the compromise
or settlement is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party and does not include any requirement that the Indemnified Party take or
refrain from taking any actions other than compliance with any non-disclosure
obligations related to the terms of such settlement contained in the
settlement agreement, (C) the compromise or settlement includes an
unconditional and irrevocable release of the Indemnified Party, (D) the
settlement agreement includes a reasonable confidentiality obligation by the
third party claimant of the terms of the settlement and (E) the Indemnified
Party is a party to, or an express third party beneficiary of, the settlement
agreement, entitled to enforce such settlement agreement. The Indemnified
Party shall have no Liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of
any Third Party Claims made without its consent (if such consent is required
by this _Section 7.6_), and any such compromise or settlement shall be void.

 



 

(e) For purposes of _Section 7.6(d)_, all actions to be taken (or not taken),
the exercise (or failure to exercise) of any rights and all notices to be
delivered by the Indemnifying Party shall be taken (or not taken), exercised
(or not exercised) or delivered by Seller Representative on behalf of the
Sellers or either of them, and each of the Sellers shall be bound thereby as
if each applicable Seller had taken (or omitted to take) such action,
exercised (or failed to exercise) such rights or delivered such notice.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Payment of Amounts Due_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the application of _Section 7.3_ and _Section 7.4_, any
amount due to any Purchaser Indemnified Party under _Section 7.2_ shall be
satisfied, first, by release to such Purchaser Indemnified Party from the
Indemnity Escrow Funds an amount equal to the lesser of (i) such amount or
(ii) the full Indemnity Escrow Funds then remaining, and, second, if such
amount due exceeds the then remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds, such excess
shall be paid by the applicable Seller or Sellers directly. Any amount payable
by the Sellers to a Purchaser Indemnified Party under this _Section 7.7_
shall be paid to such Purchaser Indemnified Party within five (5) Business
Days after it is determined pursuant to this _Article VII_ that such

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to such amount, in each case by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

 



 

(b) Subject to the application of _Section 7.3_ and _Section 7.4_, any
amount is due to any Seller Indemnified Party under _Section 7.2_ shall be
paid by the Purchaser to such Seller Indemnified Party within five (5)
Business Days after it is determined pursuant to this _Article VII_ that such
Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to such amount, in each case by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

 



 

(c) If any payment required by Sellers or the Purchaser under this _Section
7.7_ is not made in full within five (5) Business Days after it is determined
under this _Article VII_ that such payment is due, the unpaid payment shall
thereafter bear simple interest at a rate equal to the prime rate in effect
from time to time (as published in The Wall Street Journal) plus two (2)
percentage points, until paid in full.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Subrogation_. Upon the making of payment for any Losses of a
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VII_, the Sellers
shall, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of such
Purchaser Indemnified Party (and of the Purchaser and its Affiliates, if the
Purchaser is not the Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to such payment)
to which the payment relates (including without limitation any claims against
third parties); _provided, however_ , such subrogation shall not apply if and
to the extent that the exercise would reasonably be expected to have any
adverse impact on the business of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(including the Purchaser and the Target Companies). For the avoidance of
doubt, no claim for subrogation shall be made against any customer or vendor
of the Target Companies without the prior written consent of the Purchaser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. With
respect to any action for subrogation permitted by this _Section 7.8_, in
addition to any other obligation under this Agreement with respect thereto,
the Purchaser Indemnified Party (and the Purchaser and its Affiliates, if the
Purchaser is not the Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to such payment)
shall duly execute and deliver, upon request of Seller Representative, any
instruments necessary or desirable to evidence and perfect any subrogation
rights deemed granted under this _Section 7.8_.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments by Sellers_. Any
indemnification payments made by the Sellers pursuant to this Article VII
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as reductions to the Purchase Price,
unless otherwise required under applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

(a) Except in the case of Excluded Fraud, the provisions of this Article VII,
Section 1.5, Section 1.7, Section 5.16(f), Section 8.2 and Section 10.14 set
forth the exclusive rights and remedies of (a) the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made
by the Company or the Sellers or either of them in Article II or Article III
or any breach of any of the covenants and agreements of the Company (to be
performed prior to the Closing), Seller Representative or the Sellers
contained in this Agreement and (b) the Seller Indemnified Parties for any
breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any breach of any

conditions hereof.

either of the Sellers and the law firms of Kelley Drye and Warren LLP, Locke
Lord LLP, DLA Piper US LLP, or ByrneWallace relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or any attorney work-product documentation
prepared by such law firms relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Privileged Property_ "). Immediately
prior to the Closing, all Privileged Property in the possession of any Target
Company, the Seller Representative or either of the Sellers shall become the
exclusive property of the Seller Representative, as representative of the
Sellers, notwithstanding that some of the Privileged Property may
inadvertently have come or come into the possession of the Purchaser or any of
its representatives or remain in the possession of a Target Company. In the
event that a dispute arises between the Purchaser, the Company and a third
party other than the Sellers, the Purchaser or any Target Company shall assert
the attorney-client privilege in order to prevent disclosure of Privileged
Property to such third party; _provided, however_ , that such privilege may be
waived only with the prior written consent of the Seller Representative, not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable
attorney-client privilege. Each party understands and agrees that
notwithstanding the reasonable efforts of the parties to prevent the
disclosure of Privileged Property, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement may result in the inadvertent

 



      
 

 



 

disclosure of Privileged Property and that any such disclosure shall not
prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege with
respect to any of the Privileged Property.

 



 

Section 10.17 _Retention of Advisors_. In any dispute or proceeding arising
under or in connection with this Agreement following the Closing, Seller
Representative and the Sellers shall have the right, at their election, to
retain the law firms of Kelley Drye and Warren LLP, Locke Lord LLP, DLA Piper US
LLP, and/or ByrneWallace to represent them in such matter, even if such
representation shall be adverse to Purchaser and/or the Target Companies.
Purchaser and the Target Companies, for themselves and for their respective
Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably consent to any such
representation in any such matter. Purchaser and the Target Companies, for
themselves and for their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably waive any actual or potential conflict arising from any such
representation in the event of: (1) any adversity between the interests of the
Sellers on the one hand and Purchaser and the Target Companies on the other
hand, in any such matter; (2) any communication between Kelley Drye and Warren
LLP, Locke Lord LLP, DLA Piper US LLP, and/or ByrneWallace and any Target
Company, its Affiliates or employees, whether privileged or not, or any other
information known to such counsel, by reason of such counsels representation
of any of the Target Companies prior to Closing.
