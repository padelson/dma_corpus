shall the denominator of such quotient be greater than $7.14 or less than
$5.28 (subject to such proviso, the " _Transaction Share Price_ "), adjusted
as provided in _Section 3.3_ (the " _Stock Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued as

Buyer Common Stock that Buyer is permitted to issue without the approval of
the equityholders of Buyer under applicable Law, the rules and regulations of
the NYSE American or the governing documents of Buyer (such excess, the "

equityholders of Buyer under applicable Law, the rules and regulations of the

transaction; and

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) any adjustment made pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) or (ii)

prior to or at the Closing, any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to

actual figures are not available, estimates will be used subject to final
adjustments in accordance with _Section 3.6 _and _Section 3.7_.

  

 _ _

  

 _3.5 Preliminary Settlement Statement. _Not less than five (5)
Business Days prior to Closing, Sellers shall prepare and submit to Buyer for
review a draft settlement statement (the " _Preliminary Settlement Statement_
") that shall set forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting each
adjustment made in accordance with this Agreement as of the date of
preparation of such Preliminary Settlement Statement and the calculation of
the adjustments used to determine such amount, together with the designation
of Sellers' accounts for the wire transfers of funds. Within two (2) Business
Days after receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer will
deliver to Sellers a written report containing all changes, with explanation
therefor, that Buyer proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement
Statement. The Parties shall in good faith attempt to agree on the
Preliminary Settlement Statement as soon as possible after Sellers' receipt
of Buyer's written report. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed
upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing;
_provided_ that if the Parties do not agree upon an adjustment set forth in
the Preliminary Settlement Statement, then the amount of such adjustment used
to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing shall be that amount set forth in the
draft Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by Sellers to Buyer pursuant
to this _Section 3.5_.

  

 _ _

    

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

 _3.6 Final Settlement Statement._

  



  

(a) On or before one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing, a final
settlement statement (the " _Final Settlement Statement_ ") will be prepared
by Sellers, which shall take into account all final adjustments made to the
Purchase Price and shows the resulting final Adjusted Purchase Price (the "
_Final Price_ "). The Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual
proration of the amounts required by this Agreement. As soon as practicable,
and in any event within thirty (30) days, after receipt of the Final
Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a written report
containing any proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement and an
explanation of any such changes and the reasons therefor (the " _Dispute
Notice_ "). Any changes not so specified in the Dispute Notice shall be
deemed waived, and Sellers' determinations with respect to all such elements
of the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed specifically in the
Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a Dispute
Notice to Sellers containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final
Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by Sellers
will be deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by the Parties,
and will, without limiting _Section 15.2(d)_, be final and binding on the
Parties and not subject to further audit or arbitration. If the Final Price
set forth in the Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Sellers
and Buyer, the Final Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall, without
limiting _Section 15.2(d)_, be final and binding on the Parties
hereto, subject to the provisions of _Section 2.3(b)_. Any difference in the
Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at Closing pursuant to the Preliminary
Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be paid by the owing Party to
the owed Party within ten (10) days after final determination of such owed
amounts in accordance herewith. All amounts paid pursuant to this _Section
3.6 _shall be paid in accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and
subject to matters for which a Party has an indemnity obligation pursuant to
_Article XIII_, assuming any disputes pursuant to _Section 3.6(a)_ relating
to the Final Settlement Statement have been resolved, there shall be no
adjustment for, or obligation to pay, any revenues, proceeds or Operating
Expenses between the Parties following the date that is six (6) months after
the Closing Date. In the event any such disputes relating to the Final
Settlement Statement have not been resolved at such time, adjustments for, or
obligations to pay, any revenues, proceeds or Operating Expenses between
the Parties shall be extended until all such disputes have been resolved.

  

 _ _

  

 _3.7 Disputes. _If Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve the
matters addressed in the Dispute Notice (if any) (collectively, other
than Disputed Title Matters and Disputed Environmental Matters, the "
_Disputed Accounting Matters_ "), within thirty (30) days after Buyer's
delivery of a Dispute Notice, upon the written request of either Buyer or
Sellers, Buyer and Sellers shall engage the Dallas or Houston office of Grant
Thornton LLP or such other Person as the Parties may mutually select (the "
_Accounting Arbitrator_ ") to resolve any such Disputed Accounting Matters set
forth in the Dispute Notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Each of Buyer and Sellers shall within fifteen (15) Business Days
after either Party's written request for arbitration summarize its position
with regard to such dispute in a written document and submit such summaries
to the Accounting Arbitrator, together with a copy of the Dispute Notice, the
Final Settlement Statement and any other documentation such Party may desire
to submit. If there is more than one Disputed Accounting Matter, all such
disputes shall be consolidated into the same arbitration process pursuant to
this _Section 3.7_. The Parties shall cooperate diligently with any
reasonable request of the Accounting Arbitrator in an effort to resolve the
matters submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator as soon as reasonably possible
after the Accounting Arbitrator is engaged. Within twenty (20) Business Days
after receiving the Parties' respective submissions, the Accounting
Arbitrator shall render a written decision choosing either Sellers' position
or Buyer's position with respect to each Disputed Accounting Matter, based on
the materials submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator as described above. Any
decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall, without
limiting _Section 15.2(d)_, be final, conclusive and binding on Sellers and
Buyer, absent fraud or manifest error, and will be enforceable against the
Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be borne pro rata between Sellers and Buyer with each of
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, being responsible for
the Accounting Arbitrator's costs to the extent the Accounting Arbitrator has
not selected such Parties' position on an aggregate dollar basis with
respect to all amounts submitted for resolution to the Accounting Arbitrator.
Each of Sellers and Buyer shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case to the Accounting Arbitrator.

 _3.8 Allocated Values/Allocation of Purchase Price._

  

 _ _

  

  

(a) Buyer and Sellers agree that the Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Assets as set forth in _Schedule 3.8_ to this Agreement. The term
" _Allocated Value_ " means, with respect to any Well (limited to any
currently producing formations) or any Lease (limited to the applicable
Target Zone(s) set forth on _Exhibit A_ for such Lease), the amount set forth
for such Well or such Lease on _Schedule 3.8_, in each case, under the column
"Allocated Value." Buyer and Sellers agree that such allocation is reasonable
and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith, including in
notices to Preferential Purchase Right holders.

  



  

(b) Buyer and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
agree to an allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price and any other
items properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes
among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and, to the extent allowed under applicable
federal income tax Law, in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values,
within thirty (30) days after the date that the Final Settlement Statement
is determined pursuant to _Section 3.6_ (the " _Allocation_ "). If Sellers
and Buyer reach an agreement with respect to the Allocation, (i) Buyer and
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Allocation in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the
Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer and
Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, report consistently with
the Allocation, as adjusted, on all Tax Returns, including Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594, and neither Sellers nor Buyer shall take any position on
any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that no Party
shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate,
compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in
connection with such allocation.

assignment, including requirements for consents from Third Parties to any
assignment, in each case, that Buyer is required to obtain in connection with

continue to be qualified under applicable Law to own and assume
operatorship of the Assets in all jurisdictions where the Assets are located,

expense); _provided _ that no Seller or its Affiliates shall be required
pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ to deliver any notice or other instrument to

to) execute and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer will promptly file, all

(b) Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees, if any, set forth on _Schedule 4.19_ , posted by any Seller or
its Affiliates with any Governmental Authority or any non-governmental Third
Party and relating to the Assets (the " _Bonds_ ") are transferable to Buyer.
On or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in
the name of Buyer, replacements for such Bonds to the extent such
replacements are necessary (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) to permit the cancellation of such Bonds posted by
any Seller and/or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Assets. In
addition, at or prior to Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers evidence of
the posting of bonds or other security with all applicable Governmental
Authorities and all applicable Third Parties meeting the requirements of such
Governmental Authorities and such Third Parties to own and, if applicable,
operate the Assets.

  



  

(c) In the event that any Governmental Authority or any Third Party
does not permit the cancellation of any Bond posted by any Seller and/or any
Affiliate thereof with respect to the Assets, then, from and after Closing,
Buyer shall indemnify such Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, against
all amounts incurred by such Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, under
such Bond (and all costs incurred in connection with such Bond) if applicable
to the Assets acquired by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any cash placed in escrow by any Seller
or any Affiliate thereof in connection with the Bonds must be returned to
such Seller, and shall be deemed an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder.

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) repurchase or otherwise acquire, or offer to repurchase or
otherwise acquire, any equity interests of Buyer, except as permitted by any
Plan of Buyer or any applicable award contract thereunder;

  



  

(b) amend or adopt any change to any governing documents of Buyer if
such amendment or change would reasonably be expected to adversely affect (i)
the value of the consideration contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(c) issue any equity interests of Buyer or equity interests convertible
into equity interests of Buyer other than (i) under any Plan of Buyer or any
applicable award contract thereunder, (ii) issuances of Buyer Common Stock in

 _6.5 Amendment to Schedules_. The Parties agree that each Party shall
make its representations and warranties as of the Execution Date and the
Closing Date (unless otherwise specifically indicated in such representation
or warranty). The Parties agree, with respect to the representations and
warranties of a Party made in this Agreement, such Party shall have the
obligation to promptly update, supplement or amend such schedules to its
representations and warranties with respect to any matter which, if existing
on the Execution Date or thereafter, would have been required to be set forth
or described in such schedules through the Closing Date. Except as set forth
in the last sentence of this _Section 6.5_ , any disclosure in any such
addition, supplement, or amendment shall not be deemed to have subsequently
cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty as of the
date made in this Agreement, including for the purposes of indemnification
and termination rights contained in this Agreement or determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been fulfilled. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that (a) the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_
are not fulfilled as a result of all or any matters that Sellers have
included in any addition, supplement or amendment to any Schedules and (b)
Buyer elects to proceed with Closing notwithstanding the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.1_ are not fulfilled, then in such event all disclosures in any
such addition, supplement and/or amendment shall be deemed to have cured any
applicable inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement for the purposes of determining Sellers' indemnity obligations
under _Section 13.2_.

  



    

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

 _6.6 Form S-3_ _._ Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to not take any action, or fail to take any
action, which action or failure would reasonably be expected to cause Buyer to
be ineligible to file a Registration Statement on Form S-3 promulgated under
the Securities Act (or any successor form).

  

 _ _

  

 _6.7 Listing Application_. At the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
Stock Consideration to be issued in accordance with all applicable securities
Laws and the rules and policies of the NYSE American. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause all such filings with the NYSE American to be completed and otherwise
to take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary for the Stock
Consideration to be approved for listing on the NYSE American from and after
the time of Closing, subject to official notice of issuance.

  

 _ _

  

 _6.8 Records Retention_. Buyer shall and shall cause its successors

Records, (b) provide Sellers and their respective officers, employees and
representatives with reasonable access to the Records during normal business
hours for review and copying at Sellers' expense, and (c) provide Sellers and
their respective officers, employees and representatives with reasonable

 _6.9 Employee Matters_ _._

  



  

(a) _Schedule 6.9_ sets forth a list of employees of a Seller or its
Affiliate whose job duties materially involve providing services relating to
the Assets (each, a " _Company Employee_ "). Within twenty (20) days after the
Execution Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to, offer
employment to those Company Employees of its choosing, with such offers (each,
an " _Offer_ ") to include a base salary or hourly wage that is at least
equal to the base salary or hourly wage and bonus opportunities made
available to Buyer's or its Affiliate's similarly situated employees. On or
before the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer shall notify Sellers as to each Company Employee who has accepted an
Offer (each, a " _Transferred Employee_ ") and each Company Employee who has
not accepted an Offer. Such offers shall be for employment as of the Closing
Date or, if later, such date on which the applicable Transferred Employee
returns from a leave of absence.

  



  

(b) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are solely for the benefit of
the Parties hereto and nothing in this _Section 6.9_ , express or implied,
shall confer upon any Company Employee, or representative or beneficiary
thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section
6.9_ , express or implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any Plan
providing benefits to any Company Employee, or (ii) construed to prevent Buyer
or its Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any
respect any Plan that Buyer or its Affiliates may establish or maintain.

(i) (A) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letter and complying with
all of their respective obligations thereunder and (B) negotiating, entering
into and delivering definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
reflecting the terms contained in the Commitment Letter (or with other terms
agreed by Buyer and the Lender, so that such agreements are in effect no later
than the Closing Date; and

  



  

(ii) satisfying on a timely basis all the conditions to the Financing
and the definitive agreements related thereto that are applicable to
Buyer and its Affiliates.

  



  

(b) Upon (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
_Article VII_ of this Agreement and (ii) the timely satisfaction of all the
conditions to the Financing and the definitive agreements related thereto that
are applicable to Buyer and its Affiliates, Buyer and its Affiliates shall
cause the Lender to fund on the Closing Date the Financing and, in the event
of a breach by the Lender of its obligations under the Commitment Letter to
so fund, shall enforce Buyer's rights under the Commitment Letter with
respect to the Lender's obligations to so fund. Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, take or refrain from taking, directly or
indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a
failure of any of the conditions contained in the Commitment Letter or in any
definitive agreement related to the Financing. Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, object to the utilization of any "market flex"
provisions by the Lender.

  



  

(c) Buyer shall keep Sellers reasonably informed, promptly upon request
by Sellers (and in any event within two Business Days of such request), of
the status of Buyer's efforts to obtain the Financing and to satisfy the
conditions thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall notify
Sellers promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) if at any time
prior to the Closing Date:

if any Person attempts or purports to terminate or repudiate the Commitment
Letter, whether or not such attempted or purported termination or repudiation
is valid);

  



  

(ii) Buyer obtains Knowledge of any material breach or default, or any
event or circumstance that, with or without due notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or
default, by any party to the Commitment Letter or any definitive document
related to the Financing of any provisions of the Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Financing;

  



  

(iii) Buyer receives any written communication from any Person with
respect to any actual, potential or threatened breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Financing; or

  



  

(iv) the Lender refuses to provide or expresses in writing an intent to
refuse to provide all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter on the terms set forth therein (or expresses in writing that
such Person does not intend to enter into all or any portion of definitive
documentation related to the Financing or to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby).

  



    

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Buyer shall not, without Sellers' prior written consent, permit any
amendment, modification, termination, assignment or waiver (or enter into any
agreement or arrangement that would have the effect of amending, modifying,
terminating, assigning or waiving any provision of the Commitment Letter or
other agreement with the Lender) to be made to any provision of or remedy
under the Commitment Letter or other agreement with the Lender which would
expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Commitment Letter or
other agreement with the Lender in a manner that in any such case would
reasonably be expected to (i) delay or make less likely the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing
Date, (ii) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights
against the Lender or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that any
new commitment letters (or fee letters providing for any conditions precedent
or contingencies directly or indirectly related to the funding of the
Financing) are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of the Commitment Letter permitted pursuant
to this _Section 6.10(d)_ , Buyer shall promptly deliver to Sellers a true,
complete and accurate copy thereof (and in the case of any fee
letter, redacted in a customary manner solely with respect to the fees,
pricing caps and certain economic terms (including economic flex terms),
which redacted information shall not adversely affect the amount, availability
or conditionality of the funding of the Financing). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Commitment Letter" includes and means such document as
amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced in compliance with this
_Section 6.10(d)_ , and references to "Financing" shall include and mean the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as so amended, supplemented,
modified, waived or replaced, as applicable.

  



  

(e) Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due
and payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Commitment Letter.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither Buyer's nor
any of its Affiliates' obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner
upon Buyer or any of its respective Affiliates obtaining the Financing or any
other financing.

  

 _ _

  

 _6.11 Financial Information_ _._

  



  

(a) From and after the Execution Date until such time as Buyer is no
longer required under Regulation S-X of the Securities Act to
separately include financial statements associated with the Assets in
documents filed with the Commission by Buyer pursuant to the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act (it being understood that in no event shall such period
extend beyond March 31, 2020) (the " _Records Period_ "), Sellers agree to
make available to Buyer and its Affiliates and their agents and
representatives any and all books, records, information and documents to the
extent that such are attributable to the Assets and in Sellers' or their
Affiliates' possession or control and to which Sellers' and their Affiliates'
personnel have reasonable access, in each case as reasonably required by
Buyer, its Affiliates and their agents and representatives in order to
prepare Buyer Financial Statements in connection with Buyer's or its
Affiliates' filings, if any, that are required by the Commission, under
securities laws applicable to Buyer and its Affiliates, or financial
statements meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act, _provided_ that Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs or
expenses associated therewith, including, for avoidance of doubt, any such
costs and expenses associated with the storage and maintenance of records for
the foregoing purposes.

  



    

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) During the Records Period, Sellers shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their accountants, counsel, agents and other third parties
to cooperate with Buyer and its representatives in connection with the
preparation by Buyer of Buyer Financial Statements that are required to be
included in any filing by Buyer or its affiliates with the Commission,
_provided_ that Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses
associated therewith. If requested, Sellers shall use their reasonable
best efforts to execute and deliver to the external audit firm that audits
the Buyer Financial Statements (the " _Audit Firm_ ") such representation
letters, in form and substance customary for representation letters provided
to external audit firms by management of the company whose financial
statements are the subject of an audit, as may be reasonably requested by the
Audit Firm, with respect to the Buyer Financial Statements, including, as
requested, representations regarding internal accounting controls
and disclosure controls.

  



  

(c) Without limiting _Sections 6.11(a)_ and _6.11(b)_ , Sellers shall
use reasonable best efforts to provide Buyer with true and complete copies of
the audited consolidated balance sheet of WEP as of December 31, 2018,
together with the related audited consolidated statements of operations,
members' equity, and cash flows, in each case including notes thereto, for the
year ended December 31, 2018 (the " _2018 Seller Financial Statements_ "), as
soon as practicable after the Execution Date and prepared on the same basis
as the Seller Financial Statements; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may
not provide the 2018 Seller Financial Statements, in whole or in part to the
Commission, including as part of any public filing, without the prior written
consent of Sellers; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Sellers may not provide
such consent without the further prior written consent of the independent
accounting firm that has audited the 2018 Seller Financial Statements or any
portion thereof (it being understood that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer may utilize portions of the data included in such 2018 Seller Financial
Statements for purposes of preparing Buyer's own financial statements relating
to the Assets being acquired that Buyer may be required to file with the
Commission).

 ACCESS/DISCLAIMERS

  

 _ _

  

 _10.1 Access_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the
Closing Date (or earlier termination of this Agreement), but subject to the
other provisions of this _Section 10.1_, Sellers shall (i) afford to Buyer
and its authorized representatives (" _Buyer 's Representatives_") reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the Operated Assets and all Records
in Sellers' or any of their Affiliates' possession or control at such time,
and (ii) to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, to request any consents
or waivers necessary for Buyer and Buyer's Representatives to gain access to
those Assets not operated by any Seller or its Affiliates ( _provided_ that
Sellers shall not be obligated to expend any monies in connection therewith
or take any action other than making such request), in each case, to the
extent necessary to conduct the title or environmental review described in
this Agreement. All investigations and due diligence conducted by Buyer or
any Buyer's Representative shall be conducted at Buyer's sole cost, risk and
expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by Buyer or any
Buyer's Representative shall result from Buyer's own independent review and
judgment.

  



    

 | 35| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) From the Execution Date to the Title Claim Date, Buyer's inspection
right with respect to the Environmental Condition of the Assets shall be
limited to undertaking a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Operated
Assets, conducted by a reputable environmental consulting or engineering firm
approved in advance in writing by Sellers (the " _Environmental Consultant_
"), and may include only visual inspections and record reviews relating to
the Assets. In conducting such inspection, Buyer shall not operate any
equipment or conduct any testing or sampling or invasive activity (including
any testing or sampling for Hazardous Substances, Hydrocarbons or NORM)
except as provided in the remaining provisions of this _Section 10.1(b)_. If a
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment performed pursuant to this _Section
10.1_ reasonably concludes that any sampling or invasive activities are
clearly required (x) in order to evaluate, prevent or mitigate an imminent and
substantial threat to human health or the environment or (y) by applicable
Environmental Law or by any Governmental Authority, Buyer shall (i) furnish
Sellers with a written description of the proposed scope of such sampling or
invasive activities, including a description of the specific activities to be
conducted, a description of the approximate location and expected timing of
such activities, and a description of the Assets affected by the alleged
Environmental Defect and the Allocated Values thereof, and (ii) obtain the
prior written consent of Sellers to undertake such sampling or invasive
activities. If any of the proposed sampling or invasive activities interfere
with the normal operation of the Assets or the properties underlying the
Assets, Sellers may request an appropriate modification of the
proposed sampling or invasive activities. Any sampling or invasive activities
shall be conducted by the Environmental Consultant. Buyer shall obtain all
permits necessary to conduct any approved sampling or invasive activities from
any applicable Governmental Authorities;  _provided_ that, prior to Closing
and upon request, Sellers shall provide Buyer with assistance (at no cost or
Liability to Sellers) as reasonably requested by Buyer that may be necessary
to secure such permits. If Buyer reasonably requests access to conduct any
sampling or invasive activities pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ and Sellers
deny Buyer consent to conduct such sampling or invasive activities, then
either Sellers or Buyer may, at their sole election, elect to exclude such
Asset (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall only include the wellbore of
any affected Well, if applicable, together with any related Assets that are
facilities and equipment, and, other than as necessary to produce from the
excluded wellbore, shall not include the leasehold interests associated with
such Well) from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset. Sellers
or Sellers' designee shall have the right to be present during any stage
of the assessment. Buyer shall give Sellers no less than forty-eight (48)
hours' prior written notice before entering onto any of the Assets, and
Sellers or their designee shall have the right to accompany Buyer and Buyer's
Representatives whenever they are on site on the Assets. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not have access to, and shall
not be permitted to conduct any environmental due diligence (including any
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment) with respect to, any Assets to which
Sellers do not have the authority to grant access for such due diligence.

(c) Buyer shall coordinate its access rights, environmental property
assessments and physical inspections of the Assets with Sellers and all Third
Party operators to minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the
conduct of business by Sellers or such Third Party operators. Buyer shall
abide by Sellers', and any Third Party operator's, safety rules, regulations
and operating policies while conducting its due diligence evaluation of the
Assets, including any environmental or other inspection or assessment of the
Assets and, to the extent required by any Third Party operator, execute and
deliver any access or bonding agreement of such Third Party operator. Buyer
hereby defends, indemnifies and holds harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties
and the operators of the Assets from and against any and all Liabilities
arising out of, resulting from or relating to any field visit,
environmental property assessment or other due diligence activity conducted
by Buyer or any Buyer's Representative with respect to the Assets, even if
such Liabilities arise out of or result from, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, the sole,
active, passive, concurrent or comparative negligence, strict liability or
other fault OF, or THE violation of Law by, aNY Indemnified PERSON, excepting
only Liabilities TO THE EXTENT actually resulting FROM the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of ANY Indemnified PERSON.

  



  

(d) Buyer acknowledges that any entry into Sellers' offices or onto the
Assets shall be at Buyer's sole risk, cost and expense, and, subject to the
terms hereof, that none of the Seller Indemnified Parties or the operators of
the Assets shall be liable in any way for any injury, loss or damage arising
out of such entry that may occur to Buyer or any of Buyer's
Representatives pursuant to this Agreement (except to the extent such injury,
loss or damage results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Seller Indemnified Parties or the operators of the Assets). Buyer hereby fully
waives and releases any and all Liabilities against all of the Seller
Indemnified Parties and the operators of the Assets for any injury, death,
loss or damage to any of Buyer's Representatives or their property in
connection with Buyer's due diligence activities, EVEN IF SUCH
LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OF, OR THE VIOLATION OF LAW BY, ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, EXCEPTING
ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON.

  



  

(e) Buyer agrees to provide to Sellers promptly, but in no event less
than five (5) days after receipt or creation, copies of all final reports and
test results prepared by Buyer and/or any of Buyer's Representatives which
contain data collected or generated from Buyer's due diligence with respect
to the Assets. Sellers shall not be deemed by their receipt of said documents
or otherwise to have made any representation or warranty, express, implied or
statutory, as to the condition of the Assets or to the accuracy of said
documents or the information contained therein.

  



  

(f) Upon completion of Buyer's due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole
cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Sellers or their
Affiliates (i) repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with Buyer's
and/or any of Buyer's Representatives' due diligence, (ii) restore the Assets
to the approximate same condition as, or better condition than, they were
prior to commencement of any such due diligence and (iii) remove all
equipment, tools and other property brought onto the Assets in connection
with such due diligence. Any disturbance to the Assets (including the
leasehold associated therewith) resulting from such due diligence will be
promptly corrected by Buyer at Buyer's sole cost and expense.

  



    

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) During all periods that Buyer and/or any of Buyer's Representatives
are on the Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense and with
insurers reasonably satisfactory to Sellers, policies of insurance of the
types and in the amounts reasonably requested by Sellers. Coverage under all
insurance required to be carried by Buyer hereunder will (i) be primary
insurance, (ii) list the Seller Indemnified Parties as additional insureds,
(iii) waive subrogation against the Seller Indemnified Parties and (iv)
provide for ten (10) days' prior written notice to Sellers in the event of
cancellation, expiration or modification of the policy or reduction in
coverage. Upon request by Sellers, Buyer shall provide evidence of such
insurance to Sellers prior to entering the Assets.

  

 _ _

  

 _10.2 Confidentiality_. Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its
right of access to the Records or the Assets, Buyer and/or Buyer's
Representatives (including the Environmental Consultant) may become privy to
confidential and other information of Sellers or their Affiliates, and Buyer
shall ensure that such confidential information (i) shall not be used for any
purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and (ii) shall be held confidential by Buyer and Buyer's Representatives in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer agrees to
inform Buyer's Representatives of the confidential nature of such
confidential information and to be responsible for any breach of this _Section
10.2_ by any of Buyer's Representatives. If Closing should occur, the
foregoing confidentiality restriction on Buyer, including the Confidentiality
Agreement, shall terminate as of the Closing Date (except as to (a) such
portion of the Assets that are not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement, (b) the Excluded Assets and (c) information
related to Sellers or their Affiliates or to assets other than the Assets).

Article XI 
 TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTY; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

  

 _ _

  

 _11.1 Sellers' Title_.

  



  

(a) _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations_.
Except for the special warranty of title as set forth in _Section
11.1(b) _and without limiting Buyer's remedies for Title Defects set forth in
this _Article XI_, Sellers make no warranty or representation, express,
implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to their title to any of the
Assets, and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's sole remedy for
any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the
Assets (i) before Closing, shall be as set forth in _Section 11.2_ and (ii)
after Closing, shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title set forth
in _Section 11.1(b)_.

  



  

(b) _Special Warranty of Title_. If Closing occurs, then effective as
of the Closing Date and until the end of the Survival Period, Sellers warrant
Defensible Title, without duplication, to (i) each Well set forth on _Exhibit
B_ (limited to any currently producing formations), and (ii) each Lease set
forth on _Exhibit A_ (limited to the applicable Target Zone(s) set forth on
_Exhibit A_ for such Lease), unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever
lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof by, through or
under any Seller or its Affiliates, but not otherwise, subject, however, to
the Permitted Encumbrances and to any matters of record in the applicable
counties or in the applicable state or federal records prior to the Title
Claim Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, except with respect to any
liability of any Seller for any claim asserted in writing by Buyer to
Sellers in accordance with _Section 11.1(c)_ on or before the expiration of
the Survival Period for breach of such special warranty, such special
warranty shall cease and terminate at the end of such Survival Period.

  



  

(c) _Recovery on Special Warranty_.

  



  

(i) _Buyer 's Assertion of Title Warranty Breaches_. Prior to the
expiration of the period of time commencing as of the Closing Date and ending
at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the one (1) year anniversary thereof (the "
_Survival Period_ "), Buyer shall furnish Sellers a Title Defect Notice
meeting the requirements of _Section 11.2(a)_ setting forth any
matters which Buyer intends to assert as a breach of Sellers' special
warranty in _Section 11.1(b)_. For all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer
shall be deemed to have waived, and Sellers shall have no further liability
for, any breach of Sellers' special warranty that Buyer fails to assert by a
Title Defect Notice given to Sellers on or before the expiration of the
Survival Period. Sellers shall have a reasonable opportunity (not to exceed
sixty (60) days), but not the obligation, to cure any Title Defect asserted
by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 11.1(c)(i)_. Buyer agrees to reasonably
cooperate with any attempt by Sellers to cure any such Title Defect.

  



    

 | 39| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) _Limitations on Special Warranty_. For purposes of Sellers'
special warranty of title, the value of the Wells and/or Leases set forth in
_Schedule 3.8_, as appropriate ((1) for each Well, limited to any currently
producing formations for such Well, and (2) for each Lease, limited to the
applicable Target Zone(s) set forth on _Exhibit A_ for such Lease), shall be
deemed to be the Allocated Value thereof, as adjusted herein. Recovery on
Sellers' special warranty of title shall be limited to an amount (without any
interest accruing thereon) equal to the reduction in the Purchase Price to
which Buyer would have been entitled had Buyer asserted the defect giving
rise to such breach of Sellers' special warranty of title as a Title Defect
prior to the Title Claim Date pursuant to _Section 11.2_, except that the
Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible shall not
apply. Sellers shall be entitled to offset any amount owed by Sellers for
breach of Sellers' special warranty of title with respect to any Well or
Lease by the amount of any Title Benefits with respect to such Well or Lease
as to which Sellers give Buyer notice after the Title Claim Date.

  

 _ _

  

 _11.2 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. Buyer must deliver, no later than thirty
(30) days after the Execution Date (the " _Title Claim Date_ "), claim
notices to Sellers meeting the requirements of this _Section 11.2(a)_
(collectively, the " _Title Defect Notices_ " and, individually, a " _Title
Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters which, in Buyer's reasonable
opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as
Title Defects pursuant to this _Section 11.2(a)_. For all purposes of this
Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be
deemed to have waived, and Sellers shall have no liability for, any Title
Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by a Title Defect Notice
received by Sellers on or before the Title Claim Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that, for purposes of Sellers' special warranty of title under _Section
11.1(b)_, such waiver shall not apply to any matter that, prior to the Title
Claim Date, is neither reflected of record in the applicable counties or in
the applicable state or federal records nor discovered by any of Buyer's or
any of its Affiliate's employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title
examiners while conducting Buyer's due diligence with respect to the Assets.
To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing, and shall
include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Well
(including the legal description of such Well) or the Lease (including the
legal description of such Lease and the affected Target Zone(s)), or portion
thereof, affected by such Title Defect (each a " _Title Defect Property_ "),
(ii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting
documents reasonably necessary for Sellers to verify the existence of such
alleged Title Defect, (iv) Buyer's preferred manner of curing each Title
Defect and Buyer's proposed documentation for such cure and (v) the amount by
which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title
Defect Property is reduced by such alleged Title Defect and the computations
upon which Buyer's belief is based; _provided, however, _ that an alleged
failure to comply with subsections (i) through (v) above shall not cause any
such Title Defect Notice to be invalid or any Title Defect to be waived so
long as the Title Defect Notice is timely delivered and it provides reasonably
sufficient notice and supporting documents to Sellers of the existence of and
reasonable details regarding the nature of the alleged Title Defect. To give
Sellers an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer
agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Sellers, on or before the end of
each calendar week prior to the Title Claim Date, written notice of all
alleged Title Defects (as well as any claims that would be claims under the
special warranty set forth in _Section 11.1(b)_) discovered by Buyer during
the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and
supplemented prior to the Title Claim Date.

  



    

 | 40| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Title Benefit Notices_. Sellers shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Title Claim Date with
respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a " _Title Benefit Notice_ ")
including (i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit and the Well
(including the legal description of such Well) or the Lease (including the
legal description of such Lease, and the affected Target Zone(s)), or portion
thereof, affected by such alleged Title Benefit (each a " _Title Benefit
Property_ "), and (ii) the amount by which Sellers reasonably believe the
Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property is increased by such alleged
Title Benefit and the computations upon which Sellers' belief is based.
Except as set forth in _Section 11.1(c)(ii) _and _Section 11.2(a)_, Sellers
shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits for which a Title Benefit
Notice has not been delivered on or before the Title Claim Date.

  



  

(c) _Sellers ' Right to Cure_.

  



  

(i) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt,
at their sole cost, to cure, at any time on or prior to ninety (90) days
after Closing (the " _Cure Period_ "), any Title Defects of which it has been
advised by Buyer. During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of
the Cure Period, Buyer agrees to (A) afford Sellers and their
respective officers, employees and other authorized representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Assets and
all Records in Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' possession or control,
together with a right to copy such Records at Sellers' sole cost, in order to
facilitate Sellers' attempt to cure any such Title Defects and (B)
otherwise reasonably cooperate with, and not interfere with, Sellers' attempt
to cure any such Title Defects. No reduction shall be made to the Purchase
Price with respect to any Title Defect for which Sellers have provided notice
to Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date that Sellers intend to attempt to
cure during the Cure Period; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event Sellers do
not cure such Title Defect prior to the expiration of the Cure Period, Sellers
may seek the remedies set forth in _Section 11.2(d)_. An election by Sellers
to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights
under _Section 11.2(j) _and shall not constitute an admission against
interest or a waiver of Sellers' right to dispute the existence, nature or
value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title Defect.

  



  

(ii) The Parties agree that a cure (or a partial cure) may include (A)
additional oil, gas and other leasehold interests obtained after the
Effective Time, reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (the " _New Interests_ "),
constituting new leases to replace Allocated Value lost due to a Title
Defect, _provided_ that (1) such new leases cover lands in the
Designated Area and cover geologic depths that include all of the Target Zone
or Target Zones being replaced and have a paid-up primary term of not less
than one (1) year, (2) if a Seller is the operator with respect to the
Lease(s) being replaced, then a Seller must be the operator with respect to
the new leases replacing each such Lease, (3) Title Defects relating to a Net
Revenue Interest deficiency shall be cured with new leases with a Net Revenue
Interest sufficient to cure such Title Defect, and (4) Title Defects relating
to a Net Acre deficiency shall be replaced with new leases with Net Acres
sufficient to cure such Title Defect, and/or (B) obtaining New Interests
constituting additional Net Acres or Net Revenue Interest in a Lease to
replace Allocated Value lost due to a Title Defect. To the extent any New
Interests contain interests in excess of the interest necessary to cure a
given Title Defect, such excess interest shall be paid for by Buyer at an
amount equal to the same consideration paid by Sellers to acquire such excess
interest.

  



    

 | 41| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to Sellers' continuing right
to dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to _Section 14.1(c)_, in the event that any Title Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 11.2(a)_ is not waived in
writing by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period, then, subject to the
Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, Sellers
shall, at their sole option, elect to:

  



  

(i) reduce the Purchase Price or Final Price, as applicable, by the
Title Defect Amount determined pursuant to _Section 11.2(g)_ or _Section
11.2(j)_;

  



  

(ii) if the Title Defect Amount exceeds seventy-five percent (75%) of
the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such
Title Defect, retain the entirety of such Title Defect Property, together with
all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price or Final Price, as
applicable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Title Defect Property and such associated Assets; or

  



  

(iii) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
14.1(c)_.

  



  

(e) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. With respect to each Title Benefit
Property reported under _Section 11.2_, the Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount (the " _Title Benefit Amount_ ") equal to the increase
in the Allocated Value for such Title Benefit Property caused by such Title
Benefit, as determined pursuant to _Section 11.2(h) _or _Section 11.2(j)_.

  



  

(f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Buyer's rights under Sellers'
special warranty of title under _Section 11.1(b)_ and Buyer's rights to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 14.1(c)_, the provisions set
forth in _Section 11.2(d) _shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer
with respect to Sellers' failure to have Defensible Title with respect to any
Asset or any other title matter, and Buyer hereby waives any and all other
rights or remedies with respect thereto.

  



  

(g) _Title Defect Amount_. The amount by which the Allocated Value of
a Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title
Defect shall be the " _Title Defect Amount_ " for such Title Defect Property
and shall be determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions
(without duplication):

  



  

(i) if Buyer and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

  



    

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and
liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property;

  



  

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a deficiency of (A) Sellers' Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property relative to (B) the Net
Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on _Exhibit B_ , and
the Working Interest for such Title Defect Property has decreased
proportionately, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property _multiplied_ by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property
on _Exhibit B_ ;

  



  

(iv) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy where (A) the actual
Net Acres for any Title Defect Property are less than (B) the Net Acres set
forth on _Exhibit A_ for such Title Defect Property stated on _Exhibit A_ ,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product obtained by _multiplying_
such Net Acre decrease by the Allocated Value (on a per Net Acre dollar amount
basis) for such Title Defect Property; _provided_ that, if Sellers' ownership
of any applicable Net Acres in any applicable Target Zone set forth on
_Exhibit A_ for any Lease (or any tract thereof, if applicable) identified on
_Exhibit A_ covers less than the full vertical interval (subject to the
depths limitations set forth on _Exhibit A_ ) in such applicable Target Zone,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of (1) the Allocated Value
of such Net Acres for such applicable Target Zone _multiplied_ by (2) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the thickness (in feet) of the vertical
interval of such applicable Target Zone not covered by Sellers' ownership of
such Net Acres and the denominator of which is the thickness (in feet) of the
full vertical interval (subject to the depths limitations set forth on
_Exhibit A_ ) of such applicable Target Zone for such Net Acres;

  



  

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or
other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described
above, then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account
the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title
Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title
Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of
the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer
and Sellers and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Title Defect is
reasonably capable of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be
greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect;

  



  

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property
shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in
another Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

  



  

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article XI_,
the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

  



  

(h) _Title Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a
Title Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the
following methodology, terms and conditions (without duplication):

  



    

 | 43| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) if Buyer and Sellers agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that
amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

  



  

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents an increase of (A) Sellers' Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit Property over (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property on _Exhibit B_ , and the
Working Interest for such Title Benefit Property has increased
proportionately, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property _multiplied_ by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title
Benefit Property on _Exhibit B_ ;

  



  

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy where (A) the
actual Net Acres for any Title Benefit Property are greater than (B) the Net
Acres set forth on _Exhibit A_ for such Title Benefit Property stated on
_Exhibit A_ , then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product obtained by
_multiplying_ such Net Acre increase by the Allocated Value (on a per
Net Acre dollar amount basis) for such Title Benefit Property; and

  



  

(iv) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the
Title Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit
Property affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title
Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of
such Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by
Buyer and Sellers and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation.

  



  

(i) _Title Defect Threshold and Deductible_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers for any individual Title
Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed $35,000 (the "
_Individual Title Defect Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no event shall there be
any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers for
any Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual
Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title
Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to
Title Defects cured by Sellers), _plus_ (2) the aggregate Remediation Amounts
of all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental
Threshold (but excluding any Environmental Defects cured by Sellers), exceeds
(B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available
hereunder, but only to the extent that the amount by which the aggregate
amount of such Title Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts exceeds the
Aggregate Deductible. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other benefits
provided to Sellers for any individual Title Benefit for which the Title
Benefit Amount does not exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold. For the
avoidance of doubt, if Sellers retain any Title Defect Property pursuant to
_Section 11.2(d)(ii)_ , in each case the Title Defect Amount related to such
Title Defect Property will not be counted towards the Aggregate Deductible.

(j) _Title Dispute Resolution_. Sellers and Buyer shall attempt to
agree on matters regarding (i) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title
Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, and (ii) the adequacy of any
curative materials provided by Sellers to cure an alleged Title Defect (the "
_Disputed Title Matters_ ") prior to Closing or the end of the Cure
Period, as applicable. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing
(or by the end of the Cure Period if Sellers elect to attempt to cure a Title
Defect after Closing), the Disputed Title Matters shall be exclusively and
finally resolved pursuant to this _Section 11.2(j)_. There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least fifteen (15) years'
experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in
which the Title Defect Properties or the Title Benefit Properties
are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Sellers within
fifteen (15) days after the Closing or the end of the Cure Period, as
applicable, or, absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of the
American Arbitration Association (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Title Arbitrator must (A) have not been employed
by either Party (or its Affiliate) in the past ten (10) years, and (B) have
no ethical conflict in serving as the Title Arbitrator. If there is more than
one Disputed Title Matter, all such disputes shall be consolidated into the
same arbitration process pursuant to this _Section 11.2(j)_. Seller and
Buyer shall each present to the Title Arbitrator, with a simultaneous copy
to the other Party, a single written statement of its position on the defect
or benefit in question, together with a copy of this Agreement and any
supporting material that such Party desires to furnish, not later than the
tenth (10th) Business Day after appointment of the Title Arbitrator. In
making the determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of
this Agreement, and unless the Title Arbitrator requests a hearing on the
matter or additional information from either Party, shall make a
determination of the matter submitted based solely on the single written
submission of Sellers and Buyer. The Title Arbitrator shall be limited to
awarding only one or the other of the two proposed settlement amounts. The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted
in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this _Section 11.2(j)_. The Title Arbitrator's determination shall
be delivered in the form of a reasoned written opinion and made within thirty
(30) days after submission of the Disputed Title Matters and shall be final
and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his or her
determination with respect to any Disputed Title Matter, the Title Arbitrator
shall be bound by the rules set forth in _Section 11.2(g)_ and _Section
11.2(h)_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as, in
the opinion of the Title Arbitrator, are necessary to make a proper
determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, (aa) may not award Buyer a Title
Defect Amount that is (x) greater than the lesser of (I) the Title Defect
Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect Notice or (II) the
applicable proposed settlement amount submitted by Buyer under this _Section
11.2(j)_ , or (y) less than the applicable proposed settlement amount
submitted by Sellers under this _Section 11.2(j)_ , and (bb) may not award
Sellers a Title Benefit Amount that is (x) greater than the lesser of (I) the
Title Benefit Amount claimed by Sellers in their applicable Title
Benefit Notice or (II) the applicable proposed settlement amount submitted by
Sellers under this _Section 11.2(j)_ , or (y) less than the applicable
proposed settlement amount submitted by Buyer under this _Section 11.2(j)_.
The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific Disputed Title Matter submitted by either Buyer or
Sellers and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Buyer or
Sellers with respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees
and other costs of presenting its case to the Title Arbitrator. The costs of
the Title Arbitrator shall be borne pro rata between Sellers and Buyer with
each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, being
responsible for the Title Arbitrator's costs to the extent the Title
Arbitrator has not selected such Parties' position on an aggregate dollar
basis with respect to all amounts submitted for resolution by the Title
Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect
to any Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.5_ or _Section
3.6(a)_, then, within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator delivers
written notice to Buyer and Sellers of his or her award with respect to a
Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit Amount, and, subject to _Section
11.2(i)_, (1) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount, if any, so awarded by
the Title Arbitrator to Sellers, and (2) Sellers shall pay to Buyer the
amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing herein
shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration
conducted pursuant to this _Section 11.2(j)_ and, to the extent any
adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the
Purchase Price shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent
adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, will be made pursuant to _Section
3.6_ or this _Section 11.2(j)_.

 _11.3 Casualty and Condemnation Loss_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss
with respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion
(including watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of
any well) and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and
tear, in each case, with respect to the Assets, and Buyer shall not assert
such matters as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

  



  

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is
taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a " _Casualty
Loss_ "), then (x) Sellers, at Closing, shall (i) pay to Buyer all sums
actually paid to Sellers by Third Parties by reason of such Casualty Loss
insofar as with respect to the Assets and (ii) assign, transfer and set over
to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers' right, title and interest (if
any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against Third
Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance claims, of or
against any Seller Indemnified Parties) arising out of such Casualty Loss
insofar as with respect to the Assets, _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
shall purchase the affected Assets at Closing notwithstanding such Casualty
Loss, and (y) the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward to the extent, if
any, of any uninsured portion of such Casualty Loss in excess of $100,000
(with such adjustments being only the portion in excess of such threshold);
_provided_ , _however_ , Sellers shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall
assign to Sellers) all right, title, interest and claims against Third
Parties for the recovery of Sellers' costs and expenses incurred prior to
Closing in repairing such Casualty Loss and/or pursuing or asserting any such
insurance claims or other rights against Third Parties with respect to any
such Casualty Loss.

  

 _ _

  

 _11.4 Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign_.

  



  

(a) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth in
_Schedule 4.10_, Sellers, prior to Closing, shall send to the holder of each
such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in material compliance with the
contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right.

  



  

(i) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right
notifies any Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset
to which its Preferential Purchase Right applies, then the Asset subject to
such Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Assets to be
assigned to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of the portion of such
Asset affected by the Preferential Purchase Right), and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded. Sellers shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person
exercising a Preferential Purchase Right prior to Closing. If such holder of
such Preferential Purchase Right thereafter fails to consummate the purchase
of the Asset (or portion thereof) covered by such Preferential Purchase Right
on or before the end of the period of time for closing such sale but not later
than one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, (A) Sellers
shall so notify Buyer, (B) Buyer shall purchase, on or before ten (10) days
following receipt of such notice, such Asset (or portion thereof) that was so
excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, under the terms
of this Agreement and for a price equal to the amount by which the
Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to such excluded Asset (or
portion thereof) and (C) Sellers shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or portion
thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the
same form as the Assignment.

  



    

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) If, as of Closing, the time for exercising a Preferential Purchase
Right has not expired and such Preferential Purchase Right has not been
exercised or waived, then the Asset subject to such Preferential Purchase
Right shall not be included in the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing,
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset (or
portion thereof) being excluded. In the event that such holder exercises its
Preferential Purchase Right following the Closing and consummates the
purchase of the Asset (or portion thereof) covered by such Preferential
Purchase Right in accordance therewith, Sellers shall have no further
obligation to sell or convey the affected Asset (or portion thereof) and Buyer
shall have no further obligation to purchase, accept or pay for such affected
Asset (or portion thereof), and the affected Asset (or portion thereof) shall
be excluded from the Assets to be acquired by Buyer hereunder. If, within one
hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, (x) the applicable
Preferential Purchase Right is waived or expires without exercise by the
holder thereof or (y) the holder that has exercised the applicable
Preferential Purchase Right after Closing thereafter fails to consummate the
purchase of the Asset (or portion thereof) covered by such Preferential
Purchase Right on or before the end of the period of time for closing such
sale, (A) Sellers shall so notify Buyer, (B) Buyer shall purchase, on or
before ten (10) days following receipt of such notice, such Asset (or portion
thereof) that was so excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at
Closing, under the terms of this Agreement and for a price equal to the
amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to such
excluded Asset (or portion thereof) and (C) Sellers shall assign to Buyer the
Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an
instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment.

  



  

(iii) All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Purchase Right
has been waived, or as to which the period to exercise the
applicable Preferential Purchase Right has expired without exercise by the
holder thereof, in each case, prior to Closing, shall be sold to Buyer at
Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) With respect to each Consent set forth in _Schedule 4.4_, Sellers,
prior to Closing, shall send to the holder of each such Consent a notice in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Consent
seeking such holder's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



    

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) If (A) Sellers fail to obtain a Consent set forth in _Schedule 4.4_
prior to Closing and the failure to obtain such Consent would cause (1) the
assignment of the Assets affected thereby to Buyer to be void or (2) the
termination of a Lease or Contract under the express terms thereof or (B) a
Consent requested by Sellers is denied in writing (each, a " _Hard Consent_
"), then, in each case, the Asset (or portion thereof) affected by such un-
obtained Consent shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at
Closing, and as Buyer's exclusive remedy, the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the Allocated Value of such Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded. In the
event that a Consent (with respect to an Asset excluded pursuant to this 
_Section 11.4(b)(i)_) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained
within one hundred eighty (180) days following Closing, then, within ten (10)
days after such Consent is obtained (x) Buyer shall purchase the Asset (or
portion thereof) that was so excluded as a result of such previously un-
obtained Consent and pay to Seller the amount by which the Purchase Price was
reduced at Closing with respect to the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded
and (y) Sellers shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form
as the Assignment. Prior to the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days
following Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate with each other and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any outstanding Hard Consents;
_provided_ , _however_ , neither Party shall be required to incur any
Liability, pay any money or agree to any release of rights or interests in
connection therewith. Upon the election of Buyer, Buyer may waive such
failure to obtain such consent and the associated adjustment in the Purchase
Price and have Sellers assign such Asset to Buyer, in which case the Assumed
Obligations shall include all Liabilities and obligations arising out of any
failure to obtain any such Hard Consent.

  



  

(ii) If Sellers fail to obtain a Consent set forth in _Schedule 4.4_
prior to Closing and such Consent is not a Hard Consent, then the Asset (or
portion thereof) subject to such un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be
assigned by Sellers to Buyer at Closing as part of the Assets, without
adjustment to the Purchase Price, and Buyer shall have no claim against, and
Sellers shall have no Liability for, the failure to obtain such Consent.

  



  

(iii) Prior to Closing and, with respect to Hard Consents, until one
hundred eighty (180) days following Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents listed on
_Schedule 4.4_; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be required to
incur any Liability, pay any money or agree to any release of rights or
interests in order to obtain any such Consent. Subject to the foregoing,
Buyer agrees to provide Sellers with any information or documentation
that may be reasonably requested by Sellers and/or the Third Party holder(s)
of such Consents in order to facilitate the process of obtaining such
Consents.

Article XII 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

  

 _ _

  

 _12.1 Notice of Environmental Defects_.

  



  

(a) _Environmental Defects Notice_. Buyer must deliver no later than
thirty (30) days after the Execution Date (the " _Environmental Claim Date_
") claim notices to Sellers meeting the requirements of this _Section
12.1(a)_ (collectively, the " _Environmental Defect Notices_ " and,
individually, an " _Environmental Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters
which, in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and
which Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this
_Section 12.1_. To be effective, each Environmental Defect Notice shall be
in writing and shall include (i) a description of the matter constituting the
alleged Environmental Condition (including the applicable Environmental Law
violated or implicated thereby) and the Assets affected by such alleged
Environmental Condition, (ii) the Allocated Value of the Assets (or portions
thereof) affected by such alleged Environmental Condition, (iii)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Sellers to verify the existence
of such alleged Environmental Condition, and (iv) a calculation of the
Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer reasonably
asserts is necessary to Remediate such alleged Environmental Condition;
_provided, however_ , that an alleged failure to comply with subsections (i)
through (iv) shall not cause any such Environmental Defect Notice to be
invalid or any Environmental Defect to be waived so long as the
Environmental Defect Notice is timely delivered and it provides reasonably
sufficient notice and supporting documents to Seller of the existence of and
reasonable details regarding the nature of the alleged Environmental Defect.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, and for
the avoidance of doubt, any Environmental Defect asserted by Buyer pursuant to
this _Section 12.1(a) _shall be limited to the Assets only, and Buyer shall
not have the right to assert environmental defects with respect to any other
assets, properties or operations. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, and for all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer
shall be deemed to have waived, and Sellers shall have no liability for, (A)
any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an Environmental
Defect by an Environmental Defect Notice delivered to Sellers on or before
the Environmental Claim Date, and/or (B) any other environmental condition,
defect or deficiency affecting any assets, properties or operations other
than the Assets (other than contribution requirements in accordance with the
applicable operating agreements), in each case, with such liabilities being "
_Buyer 's Environmental Liabilities_." Buyer's calculation of the Remediation
Amount included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe in reasonable
detail the Remediation proposed for the alleged Environmental Condition that
gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify all assumptions
used by Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount, including the standards
that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with Environmental Laws. To give
Sellers an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects,
Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Sellers, on or before the end
of each calendar week prior to the Environmental Claim Date, written notice of
all alleged Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding
calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and
supplemented prior to the Environmental Claim Date.

  



  

(b) _Sellers ' Right to Cure_. Sellers shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to cure any asserted Environmental Defect on or before the
expiration of the Cure Period. No reduction shall be made to the Purchase
Price with respect to any asserted Environmental Defect for which Sellers
have provided notice to Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date that Sellers
intend to attempt to cure during the Cure Period; _provided_ , _however_ , in
the event Sellers do not cure such Environmental Defect prior to
the expiration of the Cure Period, Sellers may seek the remedies set forth in
_Section 12.1(c)_. During the period of time from Closing to the expiration
of the Cure Period, Buyer agrees to afford Sellers and their respective
officers, employees and other authorized representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to the Assets and all Records in Buyer's or any
of its Affiliates' possession or control in order to facilitate Sellers'
attempt to cure any such Environmental Defects. An election by Sellers to
attempt to cure an Environmental Defect shall be without prejudice to their
rights under _Section 12.1(f) _and shall not constitute an admission against
interest or a waiver of Sellers' right to dispute the existence, nature or
value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Environmental Defect.

  



    

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Sellers'
continuing right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or
the Remediation Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the
rights of the Parties pursuant to _Section 14.1(c)_, in the event that any
Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section
12.1(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period,
then, subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the
Aggregate Deductible, Sellers shall, at their sole option, elect to:

  



  

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount;

  



  

(ii) if the Remediation Amount exceeds seventy-five percent (75%) of
the Allocated Value of the Asset that is subject to such
Environmental Defect, retain the entirety of such Asset, together with all
associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset and such associated Assets;
or

  



  

(iii) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
14.1(c)_.

  



  

If Sellers elect the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and expenses
attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition attributable to
such Environmental Defect and for all Liabilities with respect thereto and
such responsibility of Buyer shall be deemed to constitute part of the Assumed
Obligations hereunder.

  



  

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for (i) Buyer's rights to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 14.1(c)_, (ii) Buyer's rights under
_Section 13.2(a)_ with respect to a breach of Sellers' representations and
warranties in _Section 4.16 _ and (iii) Buyer's rights under _Section
13.2(d)_ with respect to items (ii) and (iv) of the "Retained
Obligations" definition, the provisions set forth in _Section 12.1(c)_ shall
be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental
Defect with respect to any Asset or any other environmental matter, and Buyer
hereby waives any and all other rights and remedies with respect thereto.

  



  

(e) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustment to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers for any individual
Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed $75,000
(the " _Individual Environmental Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no event shall
there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Sellers for any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds
the Individual Environmental Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1)
the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that
exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Remediation
Amounts attributable to any Environmental Defects cured by Sellers), _plus_
(2) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the
Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts
attributable to Title Defects cured by Sellers), exceeds (B) the Aggregate
Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to
the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but only
with respect to the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Remediation
Amounts and Title Defect Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible. For the
avoidance of doubt, if Sellers retain any Assets pursuant to _Section
12.1(c)(ii)_ , the Remediation Amounts relating to such retained Assets will
not be counted towards the Aggregate Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Article XII_ , the aggregate Remediation Amounts
attributable to the effects of all Environmental Defects upon any single Asset
shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Asset.

  



    

 | 50| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. Sellers and Buyer shall
attempt to agree on (i) all Environmental Defects and Remediation
Amounts prior to Closing and (ii) the adequacy of any cure by Sellers of any
asserted Environmental Defect prior to the end of the Cure Period (items (i)
and (ii), collectively, the " _Disputed Environmental Matters_ "). If
Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing (or by the end of the Cure
Period if Sellers elect to attempt to cure an asserted Environmental Defect
after Closing), the Disputed Environmental Matters shall be exclusively and
finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this _Section 12.1(f)_. There
shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at
least fifteen (15) years' experience in environmental matters involving oil
and gas producing properties in the regional area in which the affected
Assets are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Sellers
within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date or the end of the Cure
Period, as applicable, or, absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office
of the American Arbitration Association (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Environmental Arbitrator must (A) have not
been employed by either Party (or its Affiliate) in the past ten (10) years,
and (B) have no ethical conflict in serving as the Environmental Arbitrator.
If there is more than one Disputed Environmental Matter, all such disputes
shall be consolidated into the same arbitration process pursuant to this
_Section 12.1(f)_. Seller and Buyer shall each present to the Environmental
Arbitrator, with a simultaneous copy to the other Party, a single written
statement of its position on the defect in question, together with a copy of
this Agreement and any supporting material that such Party desires to
furnish, not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after appointment of the
Environmental Arbitrator. In making the determination, the Environmental
Arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and unless the
Environmental Arbitrator requests additional information from either Party,
shall make a determination of the matter submitted based solely on the single
written submission of Seller and Buyer. The arbitration proceeding shall be
held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to
the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Section 12.1_.
The Environmental Arbitrator's determination shall be made within thirty (30)
days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and
binding upon all Parties, without right of appeal. In making his or her
determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set
forth in this _Section 12.1_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider
such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are
necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental
Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a Remediation Amount that is (x)
greater than the lesser of (I) the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its
applicable Environmental Defect Notice or (II) the applicable proposed
Remediation Amount initially submitted by Buyer to the Environmental
Arbitrator under this _Section 12.1(f)_ , or (y) less than the applicable
proposed Remediation Amount initially submitted by Sellers to the
Environmental Arbitrator under this _Section 12.1(f)_. The Environmental
Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific Disputed Environmental Matters submitted by either Buyer or Sellers
and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Buyer or Sellers
with respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case to the Environmental Arbitrator. The costs of
the Environmental Arbitrator shall be borne pro rata between Sellers and
Buyer with each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
being responsible for the Environmental Arbitrator's costs to the extent the
Environmental Arbitrator has not selected such Parties' position on an
aggregate dollar basis with respect to all amounts submitted for resolution
by the Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of
the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not
taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 3.5 _or _Section 3.6(a)_ , then, within ten (10) days after the
Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Sellers of his
or her award with respect to any Remediation Amount, and, subject to _Section
12.1(e)_, (1) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount, if any, so awarded by
the Environmental Arbitrator to Sellers, and (2) Sellers shall pay to Buyer
the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer.
Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any
arbitration conducted pursuant to this _Section 12.1(f)_, and, to the
extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the
Purchase Price shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent
adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, will be made pursuant to _Section
3.6_ or this _Section 12.1(f)_.

wastes or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets or
associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may

may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or
disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous
Substances from the Assets. The presence of NORM or asbestos-containing
materials that are non-friable cannot be claimed as an Environmental Defect,
except to the extent constituting a violation of Environmental Laws.

 _13.7 Indemnification Procedures._ All claims for indemnification
under _Section 6.3, Section 10.1, Section 13.2, Section 13.3 _and _Section
15.17 _shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

  



  

(a) For purposes of _Section 6.3_, _Section 10.1_, this _Article
XIII_ or _Section 15.17_, the term " _Indemnifying Party_ " when used in
connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Party or Parties having
an obligation to indemnify another Party and/or other Persons with respect to
such Liabilities pursuant to _Section 6.3_,  _Section 10.1_, this _Article
XIII_ or _Section 15.17_, and the term " _Indemnified Party_ " when used in
connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Party and/or other
Persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Liabilities
by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 6.3_, _Section 10.1_, this 
_Article XIII_ or _Section 15.17_.

  



  

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under _Section 6.3_,
_Section 10.1_, _Section 13.2_, _Section 13.3 _or _Section 15.17_, an
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of its claim
under this  _Section 13.7_, including the specific details of and specific
basis under this Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the
event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third
Party against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after
the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall
enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party
Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of
a Third Party Claim as provided in this _Section 13.7(b)_ shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section 6.3_,  _Section
10.1_, _Section 13.2_, _Section 13.3_ or _Section 15.17_ (as applicable)
except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being
available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the
Third Party Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's
ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.

  



  

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its
receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits
or denies its obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party
against such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during
such thirty (30) day period, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file
any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and
that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

  



   

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to defend and
indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have
the right and obligation to diligently defend and indemnify, at its sole cost
and expense, the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting
any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, at its own expense,
any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 13.7(d)_. An Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (i) settle any Third
Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto
which does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified
Party from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle
any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity).

  



  

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation or
admits its obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a
Third Party Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or
settle such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to defend against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing,
subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its obligation
and assume the defense of the Third Party Claim at any time prior to
settlement or final determination thereof. If settlement has been offered and
the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its obligation to defend and
indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed
settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) days
following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the liability and consent to
such settlement, (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable
judgment, the proposed settlement, or (iii) deny liability. Any failure by
the Indemnifying Party to respond to such notice shall be deemed to be an
election under subsection (iii) above.

  



  

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from
its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of,
(ii) admit its liability for such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for
such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified
Party within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the Liabilities or
that it disputes the claim for such Liabilities, the Indemnifying Party shall
be deemed to have disputed the claim for such Liabilities.

Closing for a period of nine (9) months. The Specified Representations, other
than the representations and warranties in _Section 4.14_ and _Section 4.26_
, shall survive Closing without time limit. The representations and warranties
in  _Section 4.14_ and _Section 4.26_ shall survive the Closing for the
applicable statute of limitations period plus thirty (30) days. The
representation and warranty of Sellers in _Section 11.1(b)_ shall terminate
as of the expiration of the Survival Period. The covenants and agreements of
the Parties in _Section 6.1 _shall survive Closing for a period of nine (9)
months. Except as otherwise set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of
this _Section 13.8(a)_, all covenants and agreements to be performed at or
prior to Closing shall terminate as of Closing. Except as otherwise set forth
in  _Section 13.8(b)_, all other covenants shall survive Closing until fully
performed. Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of
no further force or effect after the date of their expiration; _provided_ that
there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration date.

  



  

(b) The indemnities in _Section 13.2(a)_, _Section 13.2(b)_,
_Section 13.3(a) _and _ Section 13.3(b) _shall terminate as of the
expiration date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in each case as to
matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to
the Indemnifying Party on or before such expiration date. Sellers'
indemnities in _Section 13.2(c)_ shall survive the Closing for the
applicable statute of limitations period plus thirty (30) days. Sellers'
obligations in _Section 13.1(b) _ and indemnities in _Section 13.2(d)_ shall
survive Closing for a period of twelve (12) months. Buyer's indemnities in
_Section 6.3_, _Section 10.1_ and _Section 13.3(c)_ shall survive Closing
without time limit.

  



  

13.9 Waiver of Right to Rescission. Sellers and Buyer acknowledge
that, following Closing, the payment of money, as limited by the terms of
this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any
other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be
adequate compensation, following Closing, Buyer and Sellers waive any right
to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

13.10 Limitations on Damages.

  



  

(a) The amount of any Liabilities for which any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in
connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be reduced by any corresponding insurance proceeds from
insurance policies carried by a Party realized or that could reasonably be
expected to be realized by such Party if a claim were properly pursued under
the relevant insurance arrangements.

  



  

(b) The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate or resolve any Liabilities subject to indemnification under this
_Article XIII_. If the Indemnified Party fails to use such commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any
Liabilities that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the
Indemnified Party had made such efforts.

13.11 Non-Compensatory Damages. None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
nor the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Sellers
or Buyer, as applicable, or their respective Affiliates, any special,
indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages
(including damages for lost profits of any kind) arising under or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except
to the extent any such Person suffers such damages to a Third Party, which
damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in
connection with defending against such damages) shall not be excluded by this
provision as to recovery hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, each
of Buyer, on behalf of each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and Sellers, on
behalf of each of the Seller Indemnified Parties, waives any right to recover
any special, indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or
speculative damages (including damages for lost profits of any kind) arising
in connection with or with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

13.12 Indemnity Holdback.

  



  

(a) Upon Closing, subject to _Section 13.12(e)_ , the Indemnity
Holdback shall be deposited in the escrow account with the Escrow Agent as an
indemnity holdback and shall be maintained in the escrow account for the
purpose of securing the satisfaction and discharge of valid indemnity claims
of Buyer against Sellers asserted in accordance with _Article XIII_ and valid
special warranty claims of Buyer asserted in accordance with _Section
11.1(c)_. The Indemnity Holdback shall be governed by the provisions of this
_Section 13.12_ and the Escrow Agreement. The joint written authorization of
representatives of both Buyer and Sellers pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
shall be required for the disbursement of any portion of the Indemnity
Holdback.

  



  

(b) With respect to each claim for indemnification validly asserted
by Buyer against Sellers pursuant to _Article XIII_ or special warranty claim
pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_ during the period from and after the Closing
Date up to the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date
(the " _Holdback Period_ "), upon final resolution by a final, non-
appealable written court order of a court of competent jurisdiction or mutual
determination of the Parties of such an indemnity or warranty claim, Buyer
and Sellers shall instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer the amount,
if any, set forth in such joint instruction, which will be that portion of
the Indemnity Holdback being held in the escrow account using the Transaction
Share Price, as would satisfy such finally resolved or determined indemnity
or warranty claim determined to be owing to Buyer. If, upon such final
resolution or determination of any such indemnity or warranty claim, Buyer
and Sellers fail to deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the foregoing sentence, then the Escrow Agent shall, upon
delivery by Buyer or Sellers to the Escrow Agent of a final, non-appealable
written court order from a court of competent jurisdiction, pay to Buyer a
portion of the Indemnity Holdback with a value (using the Transaction Share
Price) equal to the amounts, if any, set forth in such court order.

(c) Buyer and Sellers shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
release to Sellers a portion of the Indemnity Holdback with a value
(using the Transaction Share Price) equal to an amount equal to the positive
difference between (i) Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($7,500,000.00) and (ii) any amounts previously disbursed to either Sellers or
Buyer pursuant to this _Section 13.12 _ on the first Business Day after the
six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, except for the portion of the
Indemnity Holdback (calculated using the Transaction Share Price) equal to
the aggregate amount of all outstanding valid claims for indemnification or
warranty which Buyer has provided to Sellers in accordance with _Article XIII_
or _Section 11.1(c)_ , as applicable, that have not been previously resolved
and, if applicable, satisfied (which portion shall remain part of the escrow
account until final resolution of such outstanding indemnity and/or warranty
claims). If Buyer and Sellers fail to deliver a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the foregoing sentence, then the Escrow
Agent shall, upon delivery by Buyer or Sellers to the Escrow Agent of a
final, non-appealable written court order from a court of competent
jurisdiction, pay to Sellers a portion of the Indemnity Holdback with a value
(using the Transaction Share Price) equal to the amount set forth in such
court order, together with all interest or income on or with respect to the
Indemnity Holdback.

  



  

(d) Buyer and Sellers shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
release to Sellers any Indemnity Holdback then-remaining in the
escrow account on the first Business Day after the expiration of the Holdback
Period, except for the portion of the Indemnity Holdback (calculated using
the Transaction Share Price) equal to the aggregate amount of all outstanding
valid claims for indemnification or warranty which Buyer has provided to
Sellers in accordance with _Article XIII_ or _Section 11.1(c)_ , as
applicable, that have not been previously resolved and, if applicable,
satisfied (which portion shall remain part of the escrow account until final
resolution of such outstanding indemnity and/or warranty claims). If Buyer and
Sellers fail to deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the foregoing sentence, then the Escrow Agent shall, upon
delivery by Buyer or Sellers to the Escrow Agent of a final, non-appealable
written court order from a court of competent jurisdiction, pay to Sellers
the portion of the Indemnity Holdback (calculated using the Transaction Share
Price) equal to the amount set forth in such court order, together with all
interest or income on or with respect to the Indemnity Holdback.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
Sellers shall have an option, exercisable from time to time upon notice to
Buyer, to replace all or any portion of the Buyer Common Stock being held as
the Indemnity Holdback with an amount of cash equal to the product of the
Transaction Share Price _multiplied by_ the number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock being so replaced, and at such time such Buyer Common Stock shall be
released from escrow to Sellers and such cash shall become the
"Indemnity Holdback" (or part of it as applicable). Sellers shall bear, and
pay as and when due, all costs, fees, and expenses of the Escrow Agent in
connection with any such replacement. Following any such replacement,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Transaction
Share Price shall no longer be relevant to addressing claims relating to the
Indemnity Holdback to the extent settled in cash. If the Indemnity Holdback
consists of cash and Buyer Common Stock, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, claims, if any, shall be satisfied out of cash or
Buyer Common Stock, to the extent elected by Sellers, and the disbursements
contemplated by _Section 13.12(b)_ , _13.12(c)_ or _13.12(d)_ shall be made in
cash or Buyer Common Stock, to the extent elected by Sellers.

  



  

(f) Buyer and Sellers agree to provide joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent in order to give effect to the provisions of this  _Section
13.12_.

13.13 Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity statute
relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be
applicable to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby.

TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

  



  

14.1 Right of Termination. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein may be terminated at any time prior to Closing:

  



  

(a) by Sellers, at their option, if any of the conditions set forth
in _Article VIII_ (other than the conditions set forth in _Section_ _8.3_
or _Section 8.4_) have not been satisfied on or before the Scheduled Closing
Date and, following written notice thereof from Sellers to Buyer specifying
the reason such condition is unsatisfied (including any breach by Buyer of
this Agreement), such condition remains unsatisfied for a period of ten (10)
Business Days after Buyer's receipt of written notice thereof from Sellers;

  



  

(b) by Buyer, at Buyer's option, if any of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ (other than the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3_ or
_Section 7.4_) have not been satisfied on or before the Scheduled Closing
Date and, following written notice thereof from Buyer to Sellers specifying
the reason such condition is unsatisfied (including any breach by any Seller
of this Agreement), such condition remains unsatisfied for a period of ten
(10) Business Days after Sellers' receipt of written notice thereof from
Buyer;

  



  

(c) by Buyer if the condition set forth in _Section 7.4_ has not
been satisfied on or before the Scheduled Closing Date or by Sellers if the
condition set forth in _Section 8.4_ is not satisfied on or before the
Scheduled Closing Date; or

  



  

(d) by Sellers or Buyer if Closing shall not have occurred on or
before May 15, 2019 (or such later date as agreed to in writing by
Sellers and Buyer) (the " _Outside Date_ ");

  

 _ _

  

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to clause (a), (b) or (d) above if such Party or its
Affiliates are at such time in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

  



  

14.2 Effect of Termination.

  



  

(a) If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of _Section 14.1 _hereof,
then, except as provided in _Section 3.2_ and except for the provisions of
_Sections 10.1(c) _through  _(g)_ , _10.2_ , _10.3_ , _12.2_ , _13.11_ ,
this _Section 14.2_, _Section 14.3_, _Article I _and _Article XV_ (other
than _Sections 15.2(b) _through _(i))_ , _15.3_ , _15.7_ , _15.8_ , 
_15.15_ and _15.17_ ) and such of the defined terms set forth in _Appendix I_
to give context to such Sections, this Agreement shall forthwith become void,
and the Parties shall have no liability or obligation hereunder.

  



  

   

 | 61| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If (i) Sellers have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 14.1(a)_, (ii) all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Buyer set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those actions or
deliveries to occur at Closing or contingent upon the satisfaction of other
conditions precedent set forth in _Article VII_ at Closing) have been met,
or waived by Buyer, and (iii) Sellers are ready, willing and able to perform
its obligations under _Section 9.3_, then, in such event, Sellers shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 14.1(a)_ and
receive the Deposit (together with any interest or income thereon), free of
any claims by Buyer with respect thereto, and Buyer shall, within two (2)
Business Days after such termination, pay to Sellers by wire transfer in same
day funds an additional amount equal to Fifteen Million Dollars
($15,000,000.00), and the sum of (A) the Deposit (together with any interest
or income thereon) and (B) such additional payment made by Buyer pursuant to
this _Section 14.2(b)_ shall be liquidated damages and not a penalty. The
provision for payment of liquidated damages in this _Section 14.2(b)_ has been
included because, in the event of a termination of this Agreement permitting
Sellers to receive the Deposit and such additional payment made by Buyer
pursuant to this _Section 14.2(b)_ , the actual damages to be incurred by
Sellers can reasonably be expected to approximate the amount of liquidated
damages called for herein and because the actual amount of such damages would
be difficult if not impossible to measure accurately.

  



  

(c) If (i) Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 14.1(b)_, (ii) all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Sellers set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those actions
or deliveries to occur at Closing or contingent upon the satisfaction of
other conditions precedent set forth in _Article VIII_ at Closing) have been
met, or waived by Sellers, (iii) Buyer is ready, willing and able to perform
its obligations under _Section 9.3_, and (iv) Sellers nevertheless elect not
to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or commit a Willful
Breach of this Agreement giving rise to Buyer's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 14.1(b)_, then, in such event, Buyer shall
have the right to, at its option, (1) obtain specific performance against
Sellers or (2) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 14.1(b_ ) and be
entitled to (A) receive the Deposit (together with any interest or
income thereon) from the Escrow Agent, free of any claims by Sellers with
respect thereto, and (B) recover Buyer's actual damages up to an amount not
to exceed the amount of the Deposit from Sellers that are attributable to such
breach by Sellers of this Agreement giving rise to Buyer's right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 14.2(c)_.

  



  

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by the mutual written agreement
of the Parties, or this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to
_Section 14.1_ and the Closing does not occur on or before the Closing Date
for any reason other than as set forth in  _Section 14.2(b) _or _Section
14.2(c)_, then Buyer shall be entitled to the delivery of the Deposit,
free of any claims by Sellers with respect thereto after the termination of
this Agreement.

  



  

(e) If either Sellers or Buyer are entitled to a distribution of the
Deposit pursuant to this _Section 14.2_ , each Party shall, within two (2)
Business Days of the date of such termination, deliver to the Escrow Agent an
executed counterpart of a joint written instruction in compliance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement directing the Escrow Agent to disburse the
Deposit (together with any interest or income actually earned thereon) to the
applicable Party as set forth in this _Section 14.2_.

14.3 Return of Documentation and Confidentiality. Upon termination of
this Agreement, Buyer shall destroy or return to Sellers all title,
engineering, geological and geophysical data, environmental assessments
and/or reports, maps and other information (including any confidential
information or digital Records) furnished by or on behalf of Sellers to Buyer
or prepared by or on behalf of Buyer in connection with its due diligence
investigation of the Assets, in each case in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, but if Buyer elects to destroy any such
information, an officer of Buyer shall certify same to Sellers in writing.

  



  

Article XV

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

15.1 Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules. All of the Appendices,
Exhibits and Schedules referred to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement by reference and constitute a part of this Agreement. Each
Party to this Agreement and its counsel have received a complete set of
Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules prior to and as of the Execution Date. In
the event Buyer files this Agreement with the Commission, Buyer shall omit
from such filing the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein (other than,
for the avoidance of doubt, Appendix I hereto) to the extent permitted by the
rules and regulations of the Commission, including Item 601(b)(2) of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.

  



  

15.2 Expenses and Taxes.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all fees,
costs and expenses incurred by Buyer or Sellers in negotiating this
Agreement or in consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the Party incurring the same, including legal and accounting
fees, costs and expenses.

  



  

(b) Sellers shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable
to (i) any Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the portion
of any Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time. Buyer
shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (x) any Tax
period beginning at or after the Effective Time and (y) the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) For purposes of determining the allocations described in
_Section 15.2(b)_, (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or
production of Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause
(iii), below) shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or
production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (ii) Asset Taxes that are
based upon or related to sales or receipts or imposed on a transactional
basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (i) or (iii)), shall
be allocated to the period in which the transaction giving rise to such Asset
Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other
Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, New Mexico ad valorem Asset Taxes
with respect to the 2018 tax year notwithstanding that such Asset Taxes may
be based on the proceeds of sale of production during 2017) shall be allocated
between the portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning at the
Effective Time by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of days
in the applicable Straddle Period that occur before the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of days in such
Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of clause (iii) of the preceding
sentence, the Straddle Period for such Asset Taxes shall begin on January 1,
2018, and shall end on December 31, 2018.

(d) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at
the time an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant
to _Section 3.3_, _Section 3.5 _and _Section 3.6_, as applicable, the
Parties shall utilize the most recent information available in estimating the
amount of such Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the
actual amount of an Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically
borne by a Party) is ultimately determined to be different than the amount
(if any) that was taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 3.6_, timely payments will be made
from one Party to the others to the extent necessary to cause each Party to
bear the amount of such Asset Tax that is allocable to such Party under this
_Section 15.2_.

  



  

(e) Subject to Buyer's indemnification rights under _Section 13.2_,
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) pay any Asset Taxes relating to any
Tax period that ends before or includes the Closing Date that become due and
payable after the Closing Date and file with the appropriate Governmental
Authority any and all Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date
with respect to such Asset Taxes, (ii) submit each such Tax Return to Sellers
for their review and comment reasonably in advance of the due date therefor,
and (iii) timely file any such Tax Return, incorporating any comments received
from Sellers prior to the due date therefor. The Parties agree that (x) this
_Section 15.2(e)_ is intended to solely address the timing and manner in
which certain Tax Returns relating to Asset Taxes are filed and the Asset
Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable Governmental Authority, and
(y) nothing in this _Section 15.2(e)_ shall be interpreted as altering the
manner in which Asset Taxes are allocated to and economically borne by the
Parties (except for any penalties, interest or additions to Tax imposed as a
result of any breach by Buyer of its obligations under this _Section
15.2(e)_, which shall be borne by Buyer).

  



  

(f) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses
in connection with the filing and recording of the assignments,
conveyances or other instruments required to convey title to the Assets to
Buyer shall be borne solely by Buyer. Any and all sales, use,
transfer, stamp, documentary, registration or similar Taxes incurred or
imposed with respect to the transactions described in this
Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne solely by
Buyer. Sellers and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(g) Sellers shall be entitled to any and all refunds of Asset Taxes
allocated to Sellers pursuant to _Section 15.2(b)_ and _Section
15.2(c)_, and Buyer shall be entitled to any and all refunds of Asset Taxes
allocated to Buyer pursuant to _Section 15.2(b)_ and  _Section 15.2(c)_. If
a Party or its Affiliate receives a refund of Asset Taxes to which any other
Party is entitled pursuant to this _Section 15.2(g)_, such recipient Party
shall forward to the entitled Party the amount of such refund within thirty
(30) days after such refund is received, net of any reasonable, out-of-pocket
costs or expenses incurred by such recipient Party in procuring such refund.

  



  

   

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes
relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon another Party's request) the provision of records and information that
are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided under
this Agreement. The Parties agree to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any Tax period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective Tax periods and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Buyer becomes entitled, pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_, to any amounts earned
from the sale of Hydrocarbons, which amounts are received after the date that
is six (6) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be allocated and bear
all Asset Taxes attributable to the production of such Hydrocarbons or the
receipt of proceeds therefrom notwithstanding that such Hydrocarbons were
produced prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

 _15.3 Assignment_. Subject to the provisions of _Section
15.17_, this Agreement may not be assigned by Buyer without the prior written
consent of Sellers. Any assignment or delegation made without the consents
required hereby shall be void. In the event Sellers consent to any such
assignment, such assignment shall not relieve Buyer of any obligations and
responsibilities hereunder, including obligations and responsibilities arising
following such assignment. Any assignment or other transfer by Buyer or its
successors and assigns of any of the Assets shall not relieve Buyer or its
successors or assigns of any of their obligations (including indemnity
obligations) hereunder, as to the Assets so assigned or transferred.

  



  

15.4 Preparation of Agreement. Both Sellers and Buyer and their
respective counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the
event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on
the identity of the draftsman of this Agreement.

  



  

 _15.5 Publicity_. Sellers and Buyer shall promptly consult with each
other with regard to all press releases or other public or private
announcements issued or made at or prior to Closing concerning this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein, and, except as may be required by
applicable Laws or the applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental
Authority or stock exchange, neither Buyer nor Sellers shall issue any such
press release or other public or private announcement without the prior
written consent of the other Party or Parties, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Parties shall be obligated to hold all
specific terms and provisions of this Agreement strictly confidential after
the Closing; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing in this _Section 15.5_
shall not (a) restrict disclosures by Buyer or Sellers that are required by
applicable securities or other Laws or regulations or the applicable rules of
any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the disclosing Party or its
Affiliates, _provided_ that such disclosures shall be made only to the extent
required thereunder, (b) restrict disclosures by Sellers to Quantum and
its affiliated funds and their respective limited partners or other owners
who shall be required to keep such information confidential, (c) restrict
disclosures after the Closing by Quantum and its affiliated funds on their
website of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (without
disclosing the identity of Buyer), (d) prevent Buyer or Sellers from recording
the Assignment, the Deeds and any federal or state assignments delivered at
Closing or from complying with any disclosure requirements of
Governmental Authorities that are applicable to the transfer of the Assets
from Sellers to Buyer, (e) prevent Buyer or Sellers from making any
disclosure of information relating to this Agreement if made in a manner,
under conditions and to Persons that would be permitted under the
Confidentiality Agreement so long as such Person continues to hold such
information confidential on the same terms as set forth in this _Section
15.5_ and (f) prevent Sellers from making disclosures in connection with
complying with Preferential Purchase Rights and other transfer restrictions
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.

condition, or any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed

with the Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other Parties but
for the electing Party's Exchange election.
