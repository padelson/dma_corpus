contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement:

  

  

(i) sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign, hypothecate, distribute,
grant, gift, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of (whether by merger,

contract, option or other agreement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer
of, the record or beneficial ownership or both or voting power, of any or all

derivative contract with respect to the Shareholder Owned Shares or
substantially identical property;

  

  

(iv) transfer any of the economic interest in the Shareholder Owned Shares or
enter into any transaction that has such effect;

  

  

(v) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by
purchase or otherwise, any assets of the Company or any subsidiary or division
thereof;

  

  

(vi) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any

Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence
any Person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the Company
(including by making publicly known such Shareholder's position on any matter
presented to shareholders), other than to recommend that shareholders of the
Company vote in favor of the Merger and the Merger Agreement;

  

  

(vii) submit to the Company any shareholder proposal under Rule 14a-8 under
the Exchange Act;

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(viii) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal for,
or offer of (with or without conditions) any extraordinary transaction
involving an acquisition of the Company's securities or assets;

  

  

(ix) form, join or in any way participate in a "group" (as defined in Section

(x) seek, in any way which may be reasonably likely to require, involve or
trigger public disclosure of such request pursuant to applicable Law, to have
any provision of this Section 3.1 amended, modified or waived;

  

  

(xi) otherwise take, directly or indirectly, any actions with the purpose of
avoiding or circumventing any provision of this Section 3.1 or which could
reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, impeding, interfering
with or adversely affecting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, or such Shareholder's ability
to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following Transfers are expressly permitted
under this Agreement (each such Transfer, a "Permitted Transfer"): (i) a
pledge of Shareholder Owned Shares required under any credit facility in
existence on the date hereof if such transferee agrees in writing reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent to be bound and subject to the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, (ii) Transfers to a family member of a Shareholder (or to a
trust for the benefit of a family member) or to a charitable organization if
(x) the Shareholder retains voting control of the Shareholder Owned Shares so
Transferred or (y) such transferee agrees in writing reasonably satisfactory
to the Parent to be bound and subject to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, (iii) Transfers to a third party if the transferee agrees in
writing reasonably satisfactory to the Parent to be bound and subject to the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, and (iv) Transfers to the Company in
such amounts as are necessary to satisfy the withholding taxes due in respect
of settlement of stock options or stock grants. In the event that any
Shareholder effects a Permitted Transfer (other than a Permitted Transfer
described in clause (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence), including in
connection with a Shareholder Owned Shares Proposal (subject to compliance
with Section 3.3(b)), such Shareholder shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours after consummation thereof) notify Parent of the consummation of such
Permitted Transfer and the material details thereof, including the identity of
the acquiror, the price, and the date of transfer, and shall provide evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent that such Transfer is a Permitted Transfer
(including providing, if required pursuant to the terms hereof, an agreement
in writing reasonably satisfactory to the Parent that the transferee agrees to
be bound and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement).

  

  

(b) Any Transfer in violation of Section 3.1(a) shall be void. Each
Shareholder agrees to authorize and request the Company to notify the
Company's transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with respect to
all of its Shareholder Owned Shares and that this Agreement places limits on
the voting of its Shareholder Owned Shares.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
in the event that a Shareholder acquires record or beneficial ownership of, or
the power to vote or direct the voting of, any additional shares of Company
Common Stock or other voting interests with respect to the Company, such
Shareholder shall notify Parent promptly of such acquisition. Such shares of
Company Common Stock or voting interests shall, without further action of the
parties, be deemed Shareholder Owned Shares and subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, and the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Shareholder set forth on Schedule A hereto will be deemed amended accordingly
and such shares of Company Common Stock or voting interests shall
automatically become subject to the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
each Shareholder agrees that it will not bring, commence, institute, maintain,
prosecute, join or voluntarily aid any Action in law or in equity, in any
court or before any Government, which alleges that the execution and delivery
of the Merger Agreement by the Company, or the approval of the Merger
Agreement by the Company Board, breaches any fiduciary duty of the Company
Board or any member thereof or which otherwise challenges the Merger
Agreement.

  

  

Section 3.2 Dividends, Distributions, Etc. in Respect of Shareholder Owned
Shares. In the event of a stock dividend or stock distribution, or any change
in the Company Stock by reason of any stock dividend or stock distribution,
split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the
term "Shareholder Owned Shares" shall be deemed to refer to and include the
Shareholder Owned Shares as well as all such stock dividends and stock
distributions and any securities into which or for which any or all of the
Shareholder Owned Shares may be changed or exchanged or which are received in
such transaction.

  

  

Section 3.3 No Shop.

  

  

(a) Each Shareholder agrees that (i) it is a director or officer of the
Company and (ii) in such capacity, it is subject to the restrictions of
Section 5.3 of the Merger Agreement.

  

  

  

(b) Each Shareholder agrees that it shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours after receipt with respect to a Shareholder Owned Shares Proposal)
notify Parent in writing of the receipt of a Shareholder Owned Shares Proposal
by such Shareholder or any of its Representatives. Such Shareholder shall
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) provide Parent with
(i) an unredacted copy of such Shareholder Owned Shares Proposal made in
writing that was provided to such Shareholder or any of its Representatives or
(ii) a written summary of the material terms of any such Shareholder Owned
Shares Proposal not made in writing (including the identity of the Person
proposing such Shareholder Owned Shares Proposal). Such Shareholder shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48
hours) of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any
and all Shareholder Owned Shares Proposals, including the material terms
thereof (and any material amendments and supplements thereto), and shall
provide Parent with unredacted copies of all written amendments or supplements
thereto (or, if oral, a written summary of any such amendments or
supplements). Further, upon the request of Parent, such Shareholder shall
reasonably apprise Parent of the status of such Shareholder Owned Shares
Proposals (including with respect to discussions and negotiations thereof).
Each Shareholder agrees and acknowledges that, notwithstanding the receipt of
any such Shareholder Owned Shares Proposal, such Shareholder shall be subject
in all respects to the provisions of this Agreement, including the
restrictions set forth in Section 3.1 hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, a
Permitted Transfer initiated by a Shareholder in compliance with Section
3.1(a) hereof (including the notice requirements therein) shall not be deemed
to be a Shareholder Owned Shares Proposal subject to this Section 3.3(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Each Shareholder agrees that it will promptly inform its Representatives
and its Affiliates' Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Article III.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Shareholders enter into the agreements and understandings herein solely in
their capacity as the beneficial owners of the Shareholder Owned Shares, and
nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by any Shareholder (or
Representative of a Shareholder, as applicable) in such Shareholder's (or
Representative's, as applicable) capacity as an officer or director of the
Company.

  

  

Section 3.4 Certain Provisions.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article III, no provision
of this Article III shall prohibit, limit or otherwise restrict a Shareholder
(or Representative of a Shareholder, as applicable) in such Shareholder's (or
Representative's, as applicable) capacity as a director or officer of the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
restrictions in this Article III shall terminate and be of no further force
and effect upon the termination of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger.

reasonably necessary, their identity and ownership of shares of Company Stock
and the nature of their commitments, arrangements and understandings pursuant
to this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, to the extent not provided
by the Company, the Shareholders shall promptly provide such other information
with respect to the Shareholders\' ownership of Company Stock reasonably
requested by Parent that Parent reasonably determines is required for
inclusion in any such filings, documents or schedules.

  

  

Section 7.2 Appraisal Rights. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Shareholder hereby waives and agrees not to exercise any rights of appraisal
or rights to dissent from the Merger that it may have under applicable Law.

  

  

Section 7.3 Further Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts from time to time to execute and deliver such further instruments of
assignment, transfer, conveyance, endorsement and other documents and to take
or cause to be taken all such further actions as may be reasonably required to
carry out the intent of the parties in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.4 Amendment and Waiver.

  

  

  

(a) No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in
writing and signed by each of the parties hereto.

  

  

  

(b) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy. No single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or
remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such waiving party, and any such waiver shall not be
applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is
given.

  

  

Section 7.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts (including by facsimile or .pdf), each of which shall be deemed
an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The
exchange of one or more signature pages relating to this Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by other electronic delivery shall
be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms hereof.

  

  

Section 7.6 Governing Law. This Agreement and any Legal Proceeding relating to
or arising out of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

Section 7.7 Jurisdiction; Enforcement; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) In any Legal Proceeding among or between or brought by any of the parties
in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement or any matter relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties: (a) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of the New York State Supreme Court located in New York, New York (unless the
federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, in which case each
of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District)
(the "Chosen Courts"); (b) hereby waives and agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts by motion or other
request for leave from such courts; and (c) irrevocably agrees that it will
not bring any such Legal Proceeding in any court other than the Chosen Courts.
Service of any process, summons, notice or document to any party's address and
in the manner set forth in Section 7.8 hereof shall be effective service of
process for any such Legal Proceeding.

  

  

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES, AGREES AND CERTIFIES THAT: (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO PREVENT OR DELAY ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH WAIVER; (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER; (III) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN

Section 7.9 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned, by
operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties without prior written
consent of the other parties, and any attempt to do so will be void, except
that Parent may make any such assignment to any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent or to an entity under common control with Parent.

  

  

Section 7.10 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person that is not a party
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement,. This Agreement is intended to create a contractual
relationship between each Shareholder, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, and is not intended to create, and does not create, any agency,
partnership, joint venture or any like relationship among the parties hereto.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Shareholders or
Parent, by entering into this Agreement, intends to form a "group" for
purposes of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) of the Exchange Act or any other similar
provision of applicable Law with Parent or any other shareholder of the
Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

Section 7.11 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

  

  

Section 7.12 Certain Interpretations. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa, and the any gender
shall include the feminine, masculine and neuter genders. Where a word or
phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a
corresponding meaning.

  

  

(b) The parties have jointly participated in the draft of this Agreement and
agree that any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be
resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction
or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including" and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

  

  

(d) Unless otherwise expressly indicated or the context otherwise requires:
(i) any reference in this Agreement to any contract, agreement, instrument or
other document or any Law in this Agreement shall be construed as referring to
such contract, agreement, instrument or other document or Law as from time to
time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified; (ii) any reference in this
Agreement to any Person shall be construed to include such Person's successors
and permitted assigns; (iii) any reference herein to "Sections," "Exhibits"
and "Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and
Exhibits or Schedules to this Agreement; and (iv) the words "herein", "hereof"
and "hereunder", and words of similar import, shall be construed to refer to
this Agreement in its entirety and not to any particular provision hereof. All
Exhibits and Schedules attached to this Agreement or referred to herein are
incorporated by reference in, and made a part of, this Agreement as if fully
set forth herein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(e) The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and shall not be
referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this
Agreement.

  

  

(f) References to "party" or "parties" mean Parent and each of the
Shareholders.

  

  

(g) All references to "days" shall be to calendar days unless otherwise
indicated as a "Business Day" (as such term is defined in the Merger
Agreement).

  

  

(h) No summary of this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule delivered herewith
prepared by or on behalf of any party hereto will affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement or such exhibit or schedule.

  

  

Section 7.13 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

  

  

Section 7.14 Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of
ownership of or with respect to any Shareholder Owned Shares. All rights,
ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Shareholder Owned
Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Shareholders, and Parent shall
have no authority to direct the Shareholders in the voting or disposition of
any of the Shareholder Owned Shares, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.15 Capacity as a Shareholder. The Shareholders do not make any
agreement or understanding herein in their capacity as being a director,
officer and/or representative of the Company. The Shareholders make their
agreements and understandings herein solely in their capacities as the record
holder and beneficial owner of the Shareholder Owned Shares and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing herein shall limit or
affect any actions taken in their capacity as being a director, officer and/or
representative of the Company.

  

  

Section 7.16 Counsel. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
acknowledges that it has been represented by independent counsel of its choice
throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement
and that it has executed the same with consent and upon the advice of said
independent counsel.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

Section 7.17 Several Liability. The Shareholders are entering into this
Agreement severally and not jointly. No Shareholder shall be liable for a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement by
another Shareholder.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent and each Shareholder has caused this Agreement to
be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.
