TITLE. As used herein, the term "ACCEPTABLE TITLE" shall mean, as of the
Closing Date, as to each of the Properties, such right, title and interest
that as to the existing production from the currently producing intervals in

convenience of SELLER and BUYER and included solely for the purpose of
determining Acceptable Title. SELLER does not and shall not represent or

make an environmental and other physical assessment of the Properties during
the period beginning on the date of execution of this Agreement and ending at
5:00 P.M. C.D.S.T. on the twenty-eighth (28th) day after the entry of an
order approving the Expense Motion (defined hereinafter) ("EXAMINATION
PERIOD"). BUYER and its Representatives (as herein defined) shall have the
right to enter upon the Properties and all buildings and improvements
thereon, inspect the same, and to the extent that SELLER reasonably believes
that the Properties will NOT be damaged thereby, conduct soil and water tests
and borings, and generally conduct such tests, examinations, investigations
and studies ("ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES") as may be reasonably necessary
or appropriate for the preparation of appropriate environmental and other
reports relating to the Properties, their condition, and the presence of
wastes or contaminants. SELLER shall be provided 24 hours written notice of
such activities and shall have the right to witness all such tests
and investigations and receive an equal distribution of all samples taken
by BUYER, or its Representatives. BUYER agrees to provide SELLER copies of
each site assessment report obtained in connection with the Environmental
Studies, and copies of any and all test results, reports or collected data
obtained as to the Properties within three (3) business days of the
receipt    -8-   thereof by BUYER. To the extent necessary, SELLER
hereby grants BUYER access to the Properties to conduct its Environmental
Studies UPON THE CONDITION THAT BUYER INDEMNIFIES AND HOLDS SELLER AND ITS
AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY
AND ALL CLAIMS FOR OR RELATED TO PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE DIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF BUYER OR ITS
REPRESENTATIVES ON THE PROPERTIES IN CONDUCTING ANY TESTS OR ITS OTHER
ACTIVITIES ON THE PROPERTIES, IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES.
If during the Examination Period, BUYER discovers in good faith that (i)
there is a condition or circumstance which constitutes an actual violation of
an applicable Environmental Law (as defined herein) that affects the value of
the Property(ies), or (ii) there is a claim, demand, filing, investigation,
action, suit or other legal or administrative proceeding asserted or
otherwise initiated by a governmental authority or any other person or entity
and arising from or related to the Properties or the ownership or operation
of any thereof ("ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT"), BUYER may include notice of such
Environmental Defect in a Notice of Defects ("NOTICE OF DEFECTS") delivered
hereunder, PROVIDED, that any such matter not included in a Notice of Defects
shall be waived by BUYER. BUYER acknowledges that certain of the Properties
may currently or have in the past contained asbestos or natural occurring
radioactive materials ("NORM") and that special procedures may be required
for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of such
asbestos and NORM. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, BUYER agrees to accept full responsibility for and shall pay
all costs and expenses associated with the assessment, remediation, removal,
transportation and disposal of the asbestos or NORM associated with the
Properties, and shall not be entitled to claim the fact that the asbestos or
NORM exists or that the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation
or disposal of the asbestos or NORM is not complete or that additional costs
will be required to complete the assessment, remediation, removal,
transportation or disposal of the asbestos or NORM as a Defect and BUYER (on
behalf of itself, its officers, agents, employees, affiliates, successors and
assigns) irrevocably waives such claims.   As used in this Agreement,
"ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS" shall mean all laws, statutes, ordinances, permits,
decrees, judgments, orders, rules or regulations which are promulgated,
issued or enacted by a governmental entity, or agency thereof that relate to:
(1) the prevention of pollution or environmental damages, (2) the abatement,
remediation or elimination of pollution or environmental damage, (3) the
protection of the environment generally, and/or (4) the protection of persons
or property from actual or potential exposure (or the effects of exposure) to
pollution or environmental damage; including without limitation, the Clean
Air Act, as amended, the Clean Water Act, as amended, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
the Federal Water Pollution Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended,
the Toxic Substance and Control Act, as amended, the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act of 1986, as amended, the Hazardous and the Solid Waste
Amendments Acts of 1984, as amended, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as
amended.    -9-    3.4 IDENTIFIED CLAIMS. During the Examination Period
SELLER (insofar as it has the right to do so) shall make available to BUYER
for examination and copying (at BUYER\'s cost) any of SELLER\'s non-
privileged accounting, engineering, geological, geophysical, production,
environmental and land records relating to the Properties as BUYER may
reasonably request. SELLER shall also permit BUYER\'s Representatives to
consult with SELLER\'s employees who have knowledge concerning the Properties
during normal business hours regarding such records; PROVIDED, that such
consultation shall not unreasonably disrupt the performance by such employee
of his or her regular duties with SELLER. If during the Examination Period
BUYER determines in good faith that (i) royalties, rentals or other payments
due in respect of the Properties prior to the Effective Time have not been
paid (except for those amounts in suspense), or (ii) other than those
discharged or to be discharged in the Bankruptcy Proceeding (as herein
defined), there are unsatisfied defects, claims, demands, losses, liabilities
or obligations in respect of the Properties based upon omissions, events or
occurrences prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "IDENTIFIED CLAIMS"),
BUYER may include notice of such Identified Claims in the Notice of Defects
delivered hereunder; PROVIDED, that the Prize Agreement may not be the
subject of any Identified Claim, and further any Identified Claim not
included in the Notice of Defects shall be waived by BUYER as an Identified
Claim.   3.5 NOTICE OF DEFECTS. If during the Examination Period any matter
is discovered by BUYER that, in BUYER\'s reasonable, good faith opinion,
would:   (a) cause any of the Sale Interest to fail to have Acceptable
Title (a "TITLE DEFECT");   (b) constitute an Environmental Defect; or  
(c) constitute an Identified Claim, then the items pursuant to (a) through
(c) shall herein be individually referred to as a "DEFECT", and shall herein
be collectively referred to as the "DEFECTS"; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the items
pursuant to (a) and (c) may be asserted as Defects only in the event, and
then only to the extent, that the value of each such matter, calculated on
the basis of the Allocated Value (as defined herein), exceeds a value of
$10,000, net to SELLER\'s interest. If the total value of all
asserted Defects exceeds $1,500,000 (the "MINIMUM DEFECT THRESHOLD"), BUYER
may cause a written notice (a "NOTICE OF DEFECTS") thereof to be actually
delivered to SELLER during the Examination Period, and that, if so delivered,
BUYER\'s sole remedy therefor shall be as provided in Section 3.6. The Notice
of Defects shall specifically identify the Defect and to the extent
reasonably possible include:   (i) BUYER\'s purported value of each
specific Defect, which value, except for Environmental Defects and Identified
Claims, cannot exceed the Allocated Value of the affected Well or
Property;   (ii) an identification of each affected Property;   
-10-     (iii) BUYER\'s basis for determining the existence and value of
such Defect, together with the appropriate associated reports, opinions,
data, valuations, assessments, conclusions and supporting calculations
sufficient to reasonably support the asserted Defect; and   (iv) BUYER\'s
statement of steps necessary to cure each such Defect to its reasonable
satisfaction, all of which shall be kept strictly confidential, except to the
extent required by law, regulation or order of any court or other
governmental authority or as may be necessary to address Defects identified
in a Notice of Defects.    3.6 REMEDY FOR DEFECTS ASSERTED IN NOTICE OF
DEFECTS.   (a) In SELLER\'s sole discretion, but without obligation,
it may, at its own cost, take such steps as are reasonably necessary to cure
to BUYER\'s reasonable satisfaction any Defects identified in a Notice of
Defects. In the event SELLER is unable or elects not to cure any or all such
Defects within five (5) business days after receipt of the Notice of Defects,
SELLER and BUYER shall use their best efforts to agree on the value of such
Defect(s) and in the absence of such agreement, the value of the Defect(s)
shall be the value asserted by BUYER in the Notice of Defects. Further,
SELLER at its sole discretion may by written notice delivered to BUYER within
seven (7) business days after receipt of the Notice of Defects, withdraw from
this Agreement any Property which BUYER asserts as affected by a Defect, and
the Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the Allocated Value for such
Property. The sum of: (x) the agreed value of each Defect not cured and, (y)
the asserted value of each such Defect (in the absence of an agreed value)
remaining after SELLER has withdrawn any Property from this Agreement, shall
be herein referred to as the "TOTAL DEFECT VALUE". If the Total Defect
Value:   (i) is less than the Minimum Defect Threshold, then, BUYER shall
accept and purchase the Properties, except Properties withdrawn by SELLER,
without any adjustment to the Purchase Price for Defects;   (ii) is equal to
or greater than the Minimum Defect Threshold, but less than $7,000,000, THEN,
BUYER shall accept and purchase the Properties, except Properties withdrawn
by SELLER, but including any other Property subject to any Defect, and the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted for Defects by an amount equal to the Total
Defect Value less the Minimum Defect Threshold; or   (iii) equals or
exceeds $7,000,000 ("TERMINATION THRESHOLD"), then SELLER may by written
notice delivered to BUYER within ten (10) business days after receipt of the
Notice of Defects elect to agree to accept an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for Defects in an amount equal to the Total Defect Value less the
Minimum Defect Threshold, or SELLER may elect to terminate this Agreement. If
SELLER fails to terminate, BUYER may elect to terminate this   
-11-    Agreement by written notice delivered to SELLER within two (2)
business days following the end of said ten (10) business day period;
PROVIDED if neither SELLER nor BUYER elects to terminate this Agreement, then
BUYER shall accept and purchase the Properties, except Properties withdrawn
by SELLER, but including any other Property subject to any Defect, and the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted by an amount equal to the Total Defect Value
less the Minimum Defect Threshold.   (b) POST-CLOSING. If a claimed Defect
has not been cured, waived by BUYER or the affected Property withdrawn by
SELLER prior to Closing, SELLER, at its election made at least two (2)
business days prior to Closing by giving notice of such election to BUYER,
shall have ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (the "CURE PERIOD") within
which to cure to the reasonable satisfaction of BUYER such Defect. If SELLER
elects to cure such Defect after Closing, BUYER shall deposit into an escrow
account, mutually agreed upon, a sum equal to the lesser of the Allocated
Value of the Property affected by the claimed Defect, or BUYER\'s good faith
estimate of the Defect amount, and such amount shall be deducted from the
amount of the Purchase Price paid to SELLER at Closing and the affected
Property shall be assigned to BUYER at Closing. If such claimed Defects are
cured, to the reasonable satisfaction of BUYER, or if they are waived by
BUYER, on or before the expiration of such ninety (90) day period, the Defect
amount shall be deemed to be zero and BUYER and SELLER shall jointly instruct
the escrow agent, mutually agreed upon, to distribute to SELLER the Defect
amount attributable to the claimed Defects so cured or waived, plus all
interest earned thereon, and SELLER shall have no further liability to BUYER
with respect thereto. If BUYER does not waive such claimed Defect and SELLER
is unable to cure the claimed Defect to BUYER\'s reasonable satisfaction,
within ninety (90) days after Closing, SELLER may either (i) in writing elect
to withdraw the affected Property(ies) from this Agreement and BUYER shall
reconvey to SELLER such Property(ies) and the BUYER and SELLER shall jointly
instruct the escrow agent to distribute to BUYER the escrow amount for such
Property(ies) and SELLER shall pay to BUYER the difference, if any, between
the escrow amount and the Allocated Value for such Property(ies); or (ii) if
SELLER fails to elect to withdraw the affected Property(ies), the claimed
Defect will be deemed to be accepted by SELLER, the Purchase Price will be
adjusted by the finally determined Defect amount, and the BUYER and SELLER
shall jointly instruct the escrow agent to distribute to BUYER the finally
determined Defect amount, plus the interest thereon;   (c) SELLER shall have
no obligation hereunder to any person to sell, convey, deliver or otherwise
transfer all or any part of the Properties if BUYER or SELLER terminates this
Agreement if Total Defect Value exceeds the Termination Threshold. If Closing
occurs, except for Defects for which monies are escrowed pursuant to this
Section paragraph (b), BUYER shall be DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED OR ASSUMED any
and all claims, known and unknown, arising from or related to any and all
Defects or title to or other condition of the Properties, including, without
limitation, whether or not identified in a Notice of Defects, and
notwithstanding the fact that SELLER may not have cured any such Defect(s) to
BUYER\'s satisfaction, and SELLER shall have no obligation with respect
thereto.    -12-    3.7 ALLOCATED VALUE OF PROPERTIES. "ALLOCATED VALUE"
shall mean, with respect to any Well or Unit, the amount set forth in good
faith by BUYER for the Sale Interest in each such Well or Unit, which
collectively shall total the Purchase Price, in a letter to be delivered by
BUYER to SELLER contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement.  
3.8 PREFERENTIAL PURCHASE RIGHTS AND CONSENTS TO ASSIGN. On or about the time
that the Sale Motion (as herein defined) is filed, SELLER shall make a good
faith effort to send written notice of this Agreement to all persons
or entities holding Preferential Rights affecting the Properties or Consents
to Assign, other than such consents of governmental authorities which are
usually obtained in the normal course of business after Closing, (a) offering
to sell to each such person or entity the affected Property for which a
Preferential Right is held and subject to the terms hereof and for the
Allocated Value for such Property or Properties; or (b) requesting, where
appropriate, consent to any assignment required in connection herewith. In
this regard, SELLER shall prepare the typewritten notices addressed to the
appropriate parties (along with an electronic copy of same) in form and
content acceptable to BUYER and SELLER, relative to all such Preferential
Rights and/or Consents to Assign and shall attach to each such notice a copy
of the instrument or document or the pertinent portion of each instrument or
document which created such Preferential Rights and/or Consents to Assign as
the case may be. SELLER shall also send such notices as instructed by BUYER
for any additional Preferential Rights or Consents to Assign identified by
BUYER to SELLER in writing during the Examination Period. If one (1) or more
of the holders of any Preferential Rights or Consents to Assign notifies
SELLER in writing that it commits to assert its Preferential Rights, or deny
its Consent to Assign, as the case may be, or if the holder of a Consent to
Assign otherwise fails or refuses to grant such consent, SELLER shall
promptly give notice thereof to BUYER. SELLER shall then promptly seek an
order of the Bankruptcy Court authorizing an assignment and sale of such
Properties free of any unobtained, required Consents to Assign. In the event
SELLER does not obtain the required Consents to Assign or an order of the
Bankruptcy Court authorizing a sale free of such required Consents to Assign,
BUYER may at its option elect to: (x) accept an assignment of such
Property(ies) without the required Consent to Assign, or (y) to the extent
that any required Consent not obtained expressly provides for forfeiture, or
termination of the estate assigned, or substantial liquidated damages for an
assignment without consent, exclude any or all of such Property(ies) and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value thereof. In the event
a holder of a Preferential Right commits to assert such right, then the
affected Property(ies) shall be excluded from this Agreement and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value thereof. If Closing occurs
prior to the expiration of any period permitted for consideration and
exercise of a Preferential Right and BUYER pays for a Property subject to
such Preferential Right, BUYER shall be entitled to receive, and SELLER
hereby assigns to BUYER all of SELLER\'s rights to, all proceeds due from
such holders in connection with such Preferential Rights.   3.9 RISK OF
LOSS. If, after the Effective Time and prior to the Closing, any part of the
Properties shall be destroyed or harmed by fire or any other casualty or
cause or shall be taken by condemnation or the exercise of eminent domain,
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect    -13-   as to
each affected Property, and SELLER shall at its election either collect (and
when collected pay over to BUYER) or assign to BUYER any and all insurance or
other claims related to such damage or loss, and BUYER shall take title to
the affected Property without claiming any Defect with respect to such loss
and without reduction in the Purchase Price.    ARTICLE 4. REPRESENTATIONS
