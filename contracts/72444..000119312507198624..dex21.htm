<U>Governing Law; Arbitration</U>. This Agreement (including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by the law of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law principles that would result
in the application of any Law other than the Laws of the State of New York. In the event of any dispute, controversy or Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Other Agreements, or the Transactions among any of the Parties hereto
(other than with respect to the determinations by the Accounting Arbitrator), the dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration, before three (3)&nbsp;arbitrators, which shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for the resolution of any such
dispute. Within ten (10)&nbsp;calendar days after receipt of a notice of intention to arbitrate sent by one Party, each of Seller and Buyer shall designate in writing one (1)&nbsp;arbitrator to resolve the dispute, which two (2)&nbsp;arbitrators
shall, in turn, jointly select a third arbitrator within twenty (20)&nbsp;calendar days of their designation, failing which, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association (the &#147;<B>AAA</B>&#148;) in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA. The arbitrators so designated (a)&nbsp;shall each be experienced in commercial and business affairs and specifically have expertise with businesses of types similar to that of the Biologics SBU,
(b)&nbsp;shall not be employees, consultants, officers or directors of any Party or any Affiliate of any Party and (c)&nbsp;shall not have received any compensation, directly or indirectly, from any Party or any Affiliate of any Party during the two

efforts to rule on each disputed issue within thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days after the completion of the hearings; provided, however, that the failure of the arbitrators to so rule during such period shall not affect or impair the validity of any
arbitration award. The determination of the arbitrators as to the resolution of any dispute shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all Parties hereto. All rulings of the arbitrators shall be in writing, with the reasons for the ruling given,
and shall be delivered to the Parties hereto. Each Party shall pay the fees of its respective designated arbitrator and its own costs and expenses of the arbitration and the fees of the third arbitrator shall be paid fifty percent (50%)&nbsp;by each
of Seller and Buyer; provided, that the arbitrators shall have the discretion to equitably allocate all fees and expenses of the arbitration (both of the arbitrators and the Parties themselves) based on the nature and outcome of the dispute. The
place of the arbitration shall be New York, New York. Any arbitration award may be entered in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereof and the Parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of any competent
jurisdiction for purposes of the enforcement of any arbitration award. The Parties agree that after a clear and specific factual finding has been made with respect to a particular factual matter by the arbitrators pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;12.8</U> or by the Accounting Arbitrator, such clear and specific factual finding shall be deemed to have been finally determined by the Parties for all purposes under this Agreement and, thereafter, no Party shall have the right to
