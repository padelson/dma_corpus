Purchased Assets and/or any income or gains derived with respect thereto for
any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date
("Excluded Tax Liabilities"); _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section
2.4(l)_ is qualified by the provisions of _Section 8.9_;

(m) except to the extent otherwise provided in _Sections 2.3(c)_ or _2.3(d)_ ,
all Liabilities of Seller or any predecessor arising under Environmental,
Safety and Health Laws, to the extent resulting from, caused by or arising
out of, the operations of the Biologics SBU at any time prior to the Effective
Time, or Sellers ownership, operation or lease of any properties or Assets
relating to, used in or necessary for the operation of the Biologics SBU or

(n) all other Liabilities of whatever kind and nature, primary or secondary,
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, known or unknown, whether or not

2.5 _Consent of Third Parties_. As of the Effective Time, Seller shall assign
to Buyer, and Buyer will assume, the Assigned Contracts to the
extent provided in this Agreement, in each case to the extent permitted by,
and in accordance with, applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if the assignment or assumption of all or any portion of any rights
or obligations under any Assigned Contract shall require the consent of any
other party thereto or any other third party that has not been obtained prior
to the Effective Time, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
assign, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey or otherwise transfer
any rights or obligations under any such Assigned Contract if an attempted
assignment without any such consent would constitute a breach or violation
thereof.  



 

7  In order, however, to seek to provide Buyer the full realization and value
of every Assigned Contract of the character described in the immediately
preceding sentence (i) as soon as practicable after the Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate, in all reasonable respects, to obtain any remaining
necessary consents to the assignment of any Assigned Contracts; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Party shall be required to make any material
payments or agree to any material undertakings in connection therewith, and
(ii) until the earliest of: (A) the date all such consents are obtained, (B)
the date all such Assigned Contracts expire or are terminated, or (C) the
date which is three (3) months from the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate, in all reasonable respects, to provide to Buyer the benefits under
the Assigned Contracts (with Buyer being entitled to all the gains and
subject to, and responsible for, all Losses, Taxes and Liabilities
thereunder). In connection with this _Section 2.5_, if reasonably requested
by Buyer, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to enforce
for the benefit of Buyer all reasonable claims or rights of Seller arising
under the applicable Assigned Contracts; _provided_ , _however_ , (Y) Buyer
shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for any and all Losses arising in
connection with any Action by a third party arising from, in connection with,
or otherwise with respect to actions taken or failed to be taken by Seller at
Buyers request pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ and (Z) Buyer shall reimburse
Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses actually
incurred by Seller arising from, in connection with, or otherwise with respect
to actions taken by Seller at Buyers request pursuant to this  _Section
2.5_. Buyer shall perform and comply with, at Buyers cost, all of Sellers
obligations under the Assigned Contracts as if Buyer was Seller thereunder.

2.6 _Purchase Price; Escrow_.

(a) In addition to any other amounts due hereunder, in consideration of the
sale, assignment, conveyance, license and delivery of the Purchased Assets
under Article II, Buyer shall, upon the Closing, assume the Assumed
Liabilities and pay to Seller One Hundred Eighty Five Million Dollars
($185,000,000), subject to adjustment as provided in subsections (c) and (d)
below and _Section 2.8_ (the "Purchase Price"), as follows: (i) One Hundred
Seventy Five Million Dollars ($175,000,000) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Seller Account and (ii) Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) to the Escrow Account, as set forth in _Section 2.6(b)_.

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the
"Escrow Amount") into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") with an escrow
agent that is a nationally recognized U.S. bank mutually agreed to by the
Parties (the "Escrow Agent"), to be held and distributed pursuant to the terms
and conditions of an Escrow Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, by and
among Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Agent, in a form to be negotiated in good
faith and mutually agreed by the Parties (the "Escrow Agreement"); _provided_
, that any portion of the Escrow Amount not distributed pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Escrow Agreement prior to April 15, 2009, less the
amount of any then-unresolved claims for indemnity previously asserted in
writing by Buyer against Seller (which assertion sets forth such claims in
reasonable detail), shall be released to Seller on such date. The Escrow
Amount shall be used to satisfy (i) indemnification obligations of Seller
under _Article XI_ of this Agreement, and (ii) any payment obligations of
Seller under the Purchase Price adjustments set forth in _Section 2.8_; but
in no way shall the Escrow Amount be interpreted to  



 

8  limit the amount of, or provide a cap to, such indemnification obligation or
Purchase Price adjustments.

(c) As part of the Closing, all real and personal property taxes, rents,
business, license or other prepaid fees (including PDUFA fees paid to the
FDA) and utility and other charges with respect to Purchased Assets shall be
prorated as of the Effective Time. Such prorations shall be based on the most
recent financial information available to Seller as of the Closing Date.
Seller shall be responsible for all such expenses and charges allocable to
all times up to the Effective Time and Buyer shall be responsible for all such
expenses and charges allocable to all times after the Effective Time. Seller
shall provide to Buyer at least three (3) business days prior to the Closing
Date a schedule describing in reasonable detail all such prorated amounts
relating to any Purchase Price adjustment. Buyer and Seller shall determine in
good faith an appropriate adjustment to the Purchase Price in the amount of
the proration allocated to Buyer described in the prior sentence.

(d) Also as part of the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the
amount of any BSBU Prepaid Expenses and by the amount of any credit memoranda
or positive balances with vendors under Assigned Contracts. Seller shall
provide to Buyer at least three (3) days prior to the Closing Date a schedule
describing in reasonable detail all such BSBU Prepaid Expenses, credit
memoranda and balances with vendors relating to any Purchase Price adjustment.

2.7 _Accounts Receivable_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all Accounts
Receivable shall remain the property of Seller and that those Accounts
Receivable primarily relating to the Biologics SBU and the Products shall be
collected by Buyer or its Affiliates on behalf of Seller subsequent to the
Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of _Section 8.6_ and
the Transition Services Agreement.

2.8 _Inventory_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Inventory delivered to Buyer as part of the
Purchased Assets shall include at least the following (the "Minimum
Inventory"):

(i) _Nabi-HB WIP_. 10,000 net grams of usable Nabi-HB in work-in-process
form ("Nabi-HB WIP") which shall consist of units of Nabi-HB for which
manufacturing has been initiated, but which have not yet been finally packaged
and labeled for sale. By way of clarification, the Nabi-HB WIP includes all
units at various stages of manufacturing beyond raw material, including final
bulk.

(ii) _Nabi-HB Finished Goods_. 6,000 net grams of usable Nabi-HB in finished
goods form ("Nabi-HB Finished Goods"), which shall consist of units of Nabi-HB
that have been formulated, filled and packaged.

(iii) _Specialty Plasma_. 50,000 liters of specialty (hyperimmune) plasma
("Specialty Plasma"). Specialty Plasma includes all plasma that is not Normal
Plasma.



 

9 (iv) _Normal Plasma_. 30,000 liters of normal (non-specialty) plasma ("Normal
Plasma," and together with the Specialty Plasma, the "Plasma").

The classification of Inventory as Nabi-HB WIP, Nabi-HB Finished Goods,
Specialty Plasma and Normal Plasma for purposes of the Minimum Inventory
described above shall be determined on a basis consistent with Nabis
historical practices with respect to classification of Inventory.

 

(b) _Closing Inventory Statement_. Two (2) business days prior to the proposed
Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, a statement setting
forth Sellers reasonable good faith estimate of Sellers Inventory, in units,
in each of the categories described in _Sections 2.8(a)(i)_ through _(iv)_
above (the "Minimum Inventory Categories") as of the Effective Time (the
"Closing Inventory" and "Closing Inventory Statement," respectively).

(c) _Closing Inventory Audit_. Buyer may, at its sole cost and expense, on or
after the Closing Date, cause its auditors to audit the Closing Inventory
Statement by performing a physical inspection of the Inventory delivered by
Seller at the Closing. In the event Buyer believes the Closing Inventory
Statement is incorrect, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of its objections
within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date and shall set forth in such
notice (the "Inventory Notice"), in writing and in reasonable detail: (i) the
reasons for Buyers objections; (ii) the units of each Minimum Inventory
Category in dispute described with reasonable specificity; and (iii) the
basis for the calculation of any such unit discrepancies. To the extent Buyer
does not submit an Inventory Notice as required and within such sixty (60) day
period, Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted such Closing Inventory
Statement. The Parties shall endeavor, and shall, if requested, cause their
respective accountants to endeavor, in good faith to resolve any dispute
regarding the Closing Inventory Statement within sixty (60) days after
Sellers receipt of Buyers Inventory Notice.

(d) _Resolution of Inventory Disputes_. If the Parties are unable to resolve
the disputed matters within such sixty (60) day period, the Parties shall
jointly select a nationally recognized independent accounting firm (which firm
shall not be the then-regular auditors of either Party) to resolve the matters
in dispute (in a manner consistent with this _Section 2.8_ and consistent
with any matters not in dispute), and the determination of such firm in
respect of the correctness of each matter remaining in dispute shall be
conclusive and binding on the Parties. The Parties shall furnish to such
accounting firm upon its reasonable request, the books, records and Documents
used in preparing the Closing Inventory Statement or the Inventory Notice, as
the case may be. The fees and disbursements of the independent accounting
firm selected pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_ shall be allocated to Buyer in the
same proportion as (i) the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items
so submitted to such accounting firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by Buyer
(as finally determined by such accounting firm) bears to (ii) the total amount
of the disputed items so submitted, and the balance shall be paid by Seller.

(e) _Inventory Shortfall_. If the Closing Inventory (as finally determined
following any dispute resolution process initiated under _Section 2.8(d)_) is
less than the Minimum Inventory specified in any Minimum Inventory Category,
then Seller shall pay to Buyer the Inventory Shortfall (as defined below) ten
(10) Business Days following the final determination of the Closing Inventory
hereunder. The "Inventory Shortfall" shall mean the aggregate total of (i)
the actual unit shortfall, if any, in each Minimum Inventory Category (i.e.,
Closing  



 

10  Inventory compared to Minimum Inventory) _times_ (ii) the book value of each
such unit calculated in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by
Seller.

2.9 _Purchase Price Allocation_. (a) Subject to the adjustments described in
_Section 2.8_, the Purchase Price plus any assumed Liabilities that are
required to be treated as part of the Purchase Price for federal income tax
purposes shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets and the goodwill and
going concern value of the Biologics SBU, as set forth on  _Schedule 2.9_
(the "Allocation Schedule"); and

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the final determination of the Closing
Inventory Statement (as finally determined following any dispute resolution
process initiated under _Section 2.8_), Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Buyer, an amended Allocation Schedule (the "Final Allocation") that reflects
(i) any adjustments to the Purchase Price made pursuant to _Section 2.8_,
which shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets, and (ii) any adjustments
in the allocation of the Assumed Liabilities among the Purchased Assets
reasonably necessary to reflect changes in the Purchased Assets between the
date hereof and the Closing Date. In the event Buyer believes the proposed
Final Allocation as delivered by Seller is incorrect, Buyer shall notify
Seller in writing of its objections within twenty (20) days after receipt of
the proposed Final Allocation and shall set forth, in writing and in
reasonable detail: (i) the reasons for Buyers objections; (ii) the items in
dispute described with reasonable specificity; and (iii) the amount in dispute
and the basis for the calculation of such amount. To the extent Buyer does not
object in writing and in reasonable detail as required and within such
twenty (20) day period to the proposed Final Allocation as delivered by
Seller, Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted such proposed Final Allocation,
and such proposed Final Allocation shall be deemed the finally determined
Final Allocation. The Parties shall endeavor, and shall, if requested, cause
their respective accountants to endeavor, in good faith to resolve any dispute
regarding the proposed Final Allocation within thirty (30) days after Sellers
receipt of Buyers notice of objections. If the Parties are unable to resolve
the disputed matters within such thirty (30) day period, the Parties shall
select a nationally known independent accounting firm (which firm shall not be
the then-regular auditors of either Party) to resolve the matters in dispute
(in a manner consistent with this _Section 2.9_ and consistent with any
matters not in dispute), and the determination of such firm in respect of the
correctness of each matter remaining in dispute shall be conclusive and
binding on the Parties.

(c) In accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, Buyer and Seller agree, unless otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code, to be bound by the Final Allocation, to file all Tax Returns
(including IRS Form 8594 and any supplemental or amended IRS Form 8594) in
accordance with the Final Allocation, and not to take any position
inconsistent with the Final Allocation in the course of any audit,
examination, other administrative or judicial proceeding.

2.10 _No Set-Off_. Except for amounts deposited by Buyer in the Escrow
Account, no Party shall have the right to set off any amount to which such
Party is entitled hereunder for indemnification or otherwise against any
payment such Party is required to make hereunder or under any Other Agreement.



 

11 2.11 _Risk of Loss_. Until the Effective Time, any loss of or damage to the
Purchased Assets from fire, flood, casualty or any other similar occurrence
shall be the sole responsibility of Seller. As of the Effective Time, title to
the Purchased Assets shall be transferred to Buyer. After the Effective Time,
Buyer shall bear all risk of loss associated with the Purchased Assets and
shall be solely responsible for procuring adequate insurance to protect the
Purchased Assets against any such loss.

possesses all right, title and interest in and to the BSBU Intellectual
Property and has the right to assign such BSBU Intellectual Property free and

subject to the Equitable Exceptions.

(b) to Sellers Knowledge, (i) none of the BSBU Intellectual Property has been
or is the subject of (A) any pending adverse judgment, injunction, order,

unauthorized use or violation of any Persons intellectual property rights, or
cause any Person to challenge the use, validity or enforceability of any
BSBU Intellectual Property.

(g) all BSBU Intellectual Property owned by Seller was created by (i)
employees of Seller acting at the direction of Seller, within the scope of
their employment, or (ii) by independent contractors who have assigned all
their rights in and to such BSBU Intellectual Property to Seller. No current
or former employee, stockholder, officer, director, consultant or Affiliate
of or to Seller has any claim or interest in or with respect to any material

Adverse Effect or would prevent the consummation by Seller of the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , the Parties acknowledge and agree that,
for all purposes of this Agreement, no Party makes any representation or
warranty regarding the existence of a pending or threatened Action under

3.2(a)(iii)_ and _3.2(b)(iv))_ , any applicable filings required to be made
by Seller under the Exchange Act, any applicable Blue Sky Laws and the rules
and regulations of the Exchange, no notice to, filing with, authorization of,

consummate the Transactions.

4.10 _Third Party Consents_. Except for the approval of the Required Seller

(a) _Schedule 4.23(a)_ lists all of the insurance policies maintained by
Seller that provide product liability insurance coverage, property general
liability insurance coverage, comprehensive general liability and umbrella
coverage, and all other policies maintained by Seller which would reasonably
provide insurance coverage with respect to the Purchased Assets and the
Biologics SBU (the "Insurance Policies"). For each Insurance Policy, _Schedule

Policy. No written notice of cancellation or non-renewal with respect to any
Insurance Policy has been received by Seller that has not been cured. Seller
has been covered by insurance during the past two (2) years by insurance in

has been engaged during such period.

of not less than those shown on _Schedule 4.23(a)_. Seller has timely filed

or default (including in respect of the payment of premiums or the giving of

practice with respect to BSBU Employees or DCSS Employees and there is (i) no
unfair labor practice charge or complaint pending with respect to BSBU
Employees or DCSS Employees against Seller or, to the Knowledge of Seller,

Employees arising out of or under any collective bargaining agreement is so

all written employee handbooks, policies, programs and arrangements with
respect to BSBU Employees or DCSS Employees. 

(c) All BSBU Employees and DCSS Employees are employees at will or, subject to
applicable employment laws, otherwise employed such that Seller may lawfully
terminate their employment at any time, with or without cause (in some cases
subject to notice requirements and/or obligations to pay severance or other
termination payments), without creating any material cause of action
against Seller or otherwise giving rise to any material liability of Seller
for wrongful discharge, breach of contract or tort or any other similar cause
at law or in equity. A true and correct copy of any form of non-compete, non-
solicitation or confidentiality agreement currently in force with any of the
BSBU Employees or DCSS Employees or consultants of Biologics SBU have been
delivered to Buyer.

(d) Seller has complied in all material respects with all applicable laws,

during the five (5) years prior to and including the Closing Date, nor will
any such material violation occur as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(e) Each person whom Seller has retained as an independent contractor for
Biologics SBU during the past three (3) years under an Assigned Contract
qualifies or qualified as an independent contractor and not as an employee of
Seller under the Code and all applicable state laws. Neither the execution of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall cause Seller to be in breach of any material agreement with any
employee, contractor or consultant of the Biologics SBU or cause Seller to be
liable to pay any material severance or other material amount to any employee,
contractor or consultant of the Biologics SBU.

(f) No charge or complaint of employment discrimination or other similar
charge or complaint has been made to the EEOC, any similar state or local

circumstances exist which would lead to any loss of the Boca Raton Approvals
or refusal to renew any Boca Raton Approvals on terms no less

currently in force. Seller has delivered to Buyer true and complete copes of
all such Boca Raton Approvals.

(including any environmental protection permits).

6.4 _HSR Act; Other Antitrust Laws_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Buyer and Seller shall
use their reasonable best efforts to make and shall cause their Affiliates
to use their reasonable best efforts to make all filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, application or
submission of other documents required by any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions, including: (i) any notification and report
forms and related material that may be required under the HSR Act with the

of Buyer and Seller shall promptly supply the other with any information which
may be reasonably required in order to make any filings or applications
pursuant to this _Section 6.4_. In addition, Buyer and Seller shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an early termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and shall make any further

clearance of the Transactions under the HSR Act.

(b) If required pursuant to any other applicable Antitrust Law, as soon as

investigation of the Transactions by any Governmental Authority. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall provide to the
other Party (or its respective advisors) upon request copies of all
correspondence between such Party and any Governmental Authority relating to
the Transactions. The Parties may, as they reasonably deem advisable and
necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the
other under this Section as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient with the advance written consent of
the Party providing such materials. In addition, to the extent
reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and meetings with a
Governmental Authority regarding the Transactions shall include
representatives of both Buyer and Seller. Subject to applicable Law, the
Parties will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, and
proposals, made or submitted to any Governmental Authority regarding the
Transactions by or on behalf of any Party.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants of the Parties
contained herein, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to remedy any competition concerns that any Governmental Authority may have
with respect to the consummation of the Transactions, including agreeing to
any divestitures, hold separate orders, or conduct or licensing provisions
reasonably necessary to obtain clearance of the Transactions under any
Antitrust Laws. If any administrative, judicial or legislative Action is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the sale and purchase
of the Purchased Assets or any of the Transactions as violative of any
Antitrust Law, Buyer shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts
to contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order that is
in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
Transactions. Seller shall cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with
such efforts.

6.5 _Proxy Statement; Seller Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the Execution Date,
Seller shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement
relating to Seller Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments thereof

with Buyer, will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any
comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Buyer shall
furnish all information as Seller may reasonably request in connection with
such actions and the preparation of the Proxy Statement. No more than fifteen
(15) days following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement (if no SEC
comments are received by Seller) or as promptly as practicable after the
clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC (if the SEC furnishes comments to
the Proxy Statement to Seller), Seller shall file a definitive Proxy Statement
with the SEC and mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders and to
Buyer. Subject to _Section 6.6_, the Proxy Statement shall include the
Seller Recommendation. Seller will advise Buyer, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement
or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event
or circumstance relating to Buyer, or its officers or directors, should be
discovered by Buyer which should be set  



 

41  forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, Buyer shall
promptly inform Seller. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event
or circumstance relating to Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller, or their
respective officers or directors, should be discovered by Seller which should
be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, Seller
shall promptly inform Buyer of such event and its intent to amend or
supplement the Proxy Statement with respect thereto. All documents that Seller
is responsible for filing in connection with the Transactions will comply as
to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws.

(b) _Information Supplied_. None of the written information supplied or to be
supplied by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents or Representatives expressly for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement or any other documents filed or to be filed
with the SEC in connection with the Transactions, will, as of the time such
documents (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) are mailed to
Sellers stockholders and at the time of Seller Stockholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All
documents that Buyer is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection
with the Transactions will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(c) _Seller Stockholders  Meeting_. Subject to _Section 6.6_, Seller shall
call and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Seller Stockholders
Meeting") as promptly as practicable following the date on which the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC, for the purpose of obtaining the approval of
the Required Seller Stockholders.

(d) _No Restriction_. Nothing in this _Section 6.5_ shall be deemed to
prevent Seller or the board of directors of Seller from taking any action they
are permitted or required to take under, and in compliance with, _Section
6.6_ or are required to take under applicable Law. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct Sellers operations prior to the Effective Time. 

6.6 _No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not
to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making
of any offer or proposal regarding any Alternative Transaction or (ii) enter
into, continue or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any nonpublic information relating to the Biologics SBU,
the Products or Seller in connection with, or otherwise cooperate with a
Person or group making any offer or proposal regarding any Alternative
Transaction or (iii) execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar contract constituting, providing for or related to
any Alternative Transaction other than in connection with the termination of
this Agreement as provided for in _Section 10.1(b)(ii)_.



 

42 (b) If, notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_, Seller shall have
received a bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer relating to any Alternative
Transaction received after the Execution Date, and such bona fide inquiry,
proposal or offer was unsolicited after the Execution Date, then, in response
thereto, Seller may furnish information relating to the Biologics SBU or
Seller (so long as all such information has previously been made available to
Buyer or is made available to Buyer prior to or concurrently with the time it
is made available to such Person or group), or enter into discussions or
negotiations with, the Person or group that has made such unsolicited bona
fide inquiry, proposal or offer (the "Potential Acquirer"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each of the following conditions are met: (i) such Person or
group first executes a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of,
and with terms no less favorable to Seller than, the Confidentiality
Agreement, (ii) Seller has theretofore complied with this  _Section 6.6_ in
all respects, (iii) the board of directors of Seller determines in good faith
(after consultation with Sellers outside financial advisor and outside
counsel) that such unsolicited bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Transaction and (iv)
Seller has provided Buyer with prior written notice, (A) that any information
has been requested or any discussions or negotiations have been sought to
be initiated relating to an Alternative Transaction, (B) of the identity of
the Potential Acquirer and any other terms of such request, inquiry or
Alternative Transaction (which notice shall include any written materials
containing such communication) and (C) of its intent to take any such action.

(c) Without limiting _Section 6.6(a)_, if Seller or any of its
Representatives participate in discussions or negotiations with, or provides
information to, a Potential Acquirer, Seller will keep Buyer advised on a
substantially current basis of any material developments with respect thereto.

(d) Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions,
or negotiations with any Persons other than Buyer and its Affiliates
conducted prior to the Execution Date with respect to any Alternative

consultation with Sellers outside financial advisor and outside counsel) that
an unsolicited bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer consistent with _Section
6.6(b)_ constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Transaction,
the board of directors of Seller shall give Buyer fourteen (14) days to
propose an amendment to the terms of this Agreement, after which period
Seller may withdraw or effect a change in the Seller Recommendation or,
subject to _Section 10.1(b)(ii)_, enter into an agreement with respect to
such Superior Transaction.

6.7 _Transition Activities_.

(a) Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly
furnish Buyer with such reasonable sample quantities of any Promotional
Materials that Seller may have utilized in connection with Products during the
three (3) month period prior to the Execution Date, for use by Buyer in
preparing its own Promotional Materials and; provided, however, that Buyer
shall not distribute such Promotional Materials prior to the Effective Time or
prior to making any modifications or revisions necessary to clarify that,
from and after the  



 

43  Effective Time, Seller is no longer selling the Products. All costs and
expenses incurred by Buyer with respect to creating any Promotional Materials
shall be borne by Buyer.

(b) The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith and at the Closing enter into
a Transition Services Agreement, to be effective immediately after the
Effective Time, incorporating the terms set forth on _Exhibit 6.7(b)_ and such
other terms as are mutually agreed by the parties, and providing for the
services specified therein, pursuant to which Seller and Buyer shall perform
certain transitional services for the other Party in accordance with the terms
and conditions thereof (the "Transition Services Agreement").

(c) The parties agree to negotiate in good faith and at the Closing enter into
a Contract Manufacturing Agreement, to be effective immediately after
the Effective Time, incorporating the terms set forth on _Exhibit 6.7(c)_ and
such other terms as are mutually agreed by the parties, and providing for the
services specified therein, pursuant to which Buyer shall manufacture certain
Excluded Products for Seller after Closing in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof (the "Contract Manufacturing Agreement").



     | (d) | (i) Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Seller
Shared Use Assets (which constitute Excluded Assets except to the extent
segregated or split pursuant to this Section), the Buyer Shared Use Assets
(which constitute Purchased Assets except to the extent segregated or split
pursuant to this Section) (such Assets, the "Shared Use Assets") are currently
used in or necessary to both the Biologics SBU and that portion of Sellers
business comprised of Excluded Assets (such business of Seller, the "Excluded
Business"). 
---|---|--- 

(ii) The Parties agree to cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts
between the Effective Time and the Closing Date to split or segregate such
Shared Use Assets to allow:

(A) Seller to retain, from and after the Effective Time, that portion of any
such Buyer Shared Use Asset that is necessary for the operation of
the Excluded Business after the Effective Time and that is not necessary for
the operation of the Biologics SBU after the Effective Time, as agreed prior
to the Closing, or as otherwise agreed, by the Parties; and

(B) Buyer to acquire, from and after the Effective Time, that portion of any
such Seller Shared Use Asset that is (x) necessary for the operation of the
Biologics SBU after the Effective Time, (y) a Corporate Shared Services Asset
necessary for or used in the provision of corporate shared services at the
Boca Raton Facility and (z) that is not necessary for the operation of
the Excluded Business after the Effective Time, as agreed prior to the
Closing by the Parties.



 

44 (iii) To the extent that a Buyer Seller Shared Use Asset is split or
segregated pursuant to this Section, the split or segregated portion agreed
by the Parties to be owned or held by Seller after the Effective Time shall
constitute, without further action required by the Parties, an Excluded Asset.
To the extent that a Seller Shared Use Asset is split or segregated pursuant
to this Section, the split or segregated portion agreed by the Parties to be
owned or held by Buyer after the Effective Time shall constitute, without
further action required by the Parties, a Purchased Asset. 

(e) _Review of Certain Contracts_. The Parties acknowledge that due to
operational considerations copies of certain Assigned Contracts have been
delivered by Seller to Buyer for the first time within the two weeks prior to
the Execution Date ("Recent Contracts"). During the two week period following
the Execution Date, Seller and Buyer shall each independently review the
Recent Contracts to identify any such contracts that such Party reasonably
believes (a) are not required to operate the BSBU, (b) are likely to have an
unforeseen adverse financial effect on the BSBU of more than $50,000, (c)
would be unenforceable or would raise concerns regarding material compliance
with Applicable Laws in connection with operation of the BSBU, or (d) would be
unduly onerous to the operation of the BSBU after the Effective Time (any
such Recent Contract so identified a "Designated Contract"). Upon completion
of such review but in no event later than two weeks following the Execution
Date, each Party shall notify the other Party of Designated Contracts,
if any, identified in such Partys review. Prior to the Closing, the Parties
shall work together in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve to their mutual satisfaction any adverse issues (as described in
(a)-(d) above) raised in connection with any Designated Contracts identified
in such review. Resolution of adverse issues may include, if the Parties
mutually agree, treatment of the Designated Contract as an Excluded Asset.

6.8 _Notifications; Updated Schedules_. Between the Execution Date and the
Closing Date:

(a) Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer and Parent, on the other hand, shall
promptly notify the other Party or Parties in writing of any fact,
change, condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event
of which it is aware that will or is reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions set forth in _Articles III_ or _VII_ becoming incapable of being
satisfied;  _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 6.8_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the Party or Parties receiving such notice;

(b) Seller shall give prompt notice to Buyer and Parent of (i) the existence,
occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact, condition, matter, circumstance,
claim or event the existence, occurrence or non-occurrence of which if not
disclosed in the Schedules would cause the representations or warranties of
Seller contained in _Article IV_ to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any material
failure of Seller to  



 

45  perform, comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
performed, complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or under any
Other Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Schedules shall be deemed
to include only that information contained therein on the date of this
Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude any information contained in any such
notice for all purposes of this Agreement, including _Article XI_ , and the
delivery of such notice shall not be deemed to prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or breach of covenant; except that if
any such information would cause a condition to Buyer and Parents obligation
to close the Transactions not to be met, in accordance with _Articles III_ and
_VII_ , and Buyer and Parent choose to waive the condition with respect to
such information and close, the Schedules shall be deemed to be amended to
reflect such information for purposes of _Article XI_ ; and

(c) Seller may, by delivery to Buyer and Parent, update _Schedules 1.1(a)_
through _1.1(y)_ and other Schedules representing informational disclosures
rather than exceptions to representations and warranties as described in
_Section 6.8(b)_ above to correct typographical errors or inadvertent
omissions and changes arising during the period between the Execution Date and
Effective Time not resulting from a breach of a covenant of Seller in this
Agreement and, absent an objection by Buyer and Parent in writing to be
reasonably resolved between the Parties, any such updated Schedules shall
replace the Schedules delivered by Seller in connection with the execution of
this Agreement.

6.9 _Further Assurances; Further Documents_.

(a) As of the Execution Date, each of the Parties shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, in the most expeditious manner practicable, (i) to satisfy
or cause to be satisfied all the conditions precedent that are set forth in 
_Article VII_, as applicable to each of them, (ii) to cause the Transactions
to be consummated and (iii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
to obtain all consents and authorizations of third parties and to make
all filings with, and give all notices to, third parties that may be
necessary or reasonably required on its part in order to consummate the
Transactions.

(b) Each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates
to, at the request of another Party, take all actions such other Party may
reasonably request to help facilitate the physical transfer any Excluded
Assets from any BSBU Real Property in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions.

(c) Each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates
to, at the request of another Party, execute and deliver to such other Party
all such further instruments, assignments, assurances and other documents as
such other Party may reasonably request in connection with the consummation
of the Transactions.

(d) The Parties agree that in the event that, as of the Effective Time and
despite the use of commercially reasonable efforts, the Parties have not
successfully split or segregated all Shared Use Assets pursuant to _Section
6.7(d)_, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to provide each other
with continued use of or access to any such non-segregated Shared Use Assets
through the Transition Services Agreement as reasonably requested.



 

46 6.10 _Inventory_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that the Closing Inventory, as reflected in the Closing Inventory Statement,
equals or exceeds the Minimum Inventory, provided, however, that Buyers and
Parents remedy for a failure to satisfy such covenant shall be exclusively
limited to the Inventory Shortfall payment described in _Section 2.8(e)_.

6.11 _Buyer Financing_. Buyer shall complete the financing
arrangements contemplated by the Capital Commitment as necessary for Buyer to
fund and pay the Purchase Price on the Closing Date as contemplated by
_Section 2.6(a)_ in a timely manner and in no event later than the Outside
Date.

Seller to Buyer of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that such license shall not obligate Buyer to

for the benefit of Seller. Except as provided in Section 8.3(b), upon the
expiration or termination of such license, Buyer shall discontinue, and shall
cause all of its Affiliates and distributors to discontinue, all uses of the

reasonable requests and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in
connection with the investigation of and response to any complaint or adverse
drug experience related to Products sold by Seller. Seller will also promptly
inform Buyer within three (3) Business Days if: (i) Seller receives any

planned or contemplated audits, inspections, or reviews of documents, sites or

to update any surveys with respect to the Facilities, (ii) all Transfer Taxes
payable in connection with any mortgages obtained by Buyer, (iii) all other

for Taxes for a portion of a taxable year or period that begins before and
ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the determination of the
Taxes for the portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the
year or period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined

basis.

whichever is earlier.

8.10 _Insurance_. Upon the Closing Date, and for a period of time expiring

Policies set forth on _Schedule 4.23(a)_ , or tail coverage reasonably
comparable thereto, at its cost, in full force and effect and (b) Buyer shall

(a) Buyer shall offer to employ, on an at-will basis and at compensation
levels/bonus opportunities reasonably comparable to those currently available
to such employees, all BSBU Employees and all DCSS Employees, subject to
their resignation from employment with Seller. Any such offers of employment
shall be in writing and shall be delivered to such employees at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing (each employee who accepts such offer and
becomes employed by Buyer, herein referred to as a "Hired Employee"). For a
period of two (2) years following the Execution Date, Buyer agrees that,
except as permitted by this _Section 9.1(a)_ or as agreed to in writing by
Seller, it shall not solicit for employment, offer employment to, or hire as
an employee or consultant any individual who is, or was within six (6) months
prior to such solicitation, offer, or hiring, an employee of Seller, except
those employees whose work relates to the Biologics SBU or the operation of
Sellers headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.

(b) [Reserved].

(c) Buyer shall offer to all Hired Employees participation in a Plan that is
intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code and in the
following benefits: medical, dental, vision, accident, life, disability,
vacation and leave, but excluding equity  



 

54  incentives and severance that are, taken as a whole, reasonably comparable
to those similar arrangements available to the Hired Employees by
Seller immediately prior to the Closing.

9.2 _Benefits_.

(a) As of the Effective Time, Hired Employees who are participants in the
Seller Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(k) of the
Code (the "Sellers 401(k) Plan") shall cease to be eligible for any future
contributions to Sellers 401(k) Plan except with respect to compensation from
Seller prior to the Closing and as provided under Sellers 401(k) Plan, and
shall be entitled to a distribution of their account balances under Sellers
401(k) Plan in accordance with such plan and as permitted by the Code. Hired
Employees who receive an eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of
Section 402(c)(4) of the Code, including a direct transfer of an eligible
rollover distribution within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code)
from Sellers 401(k) Plan shall, subject to the provisions of Section 402 of
the Code, be permitted to make a rollover contribution, including a rollover
of any loans outstanding under Sellers 401(k) Plan, to a plan maintained by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer that is intended to meet the requirements of
Section 401(k) of the Code.

(b) Seller shall pay out to any Hired Employees all paid leave bank benefits
earned but not yet used as of the date on which they terminate
employment with Seller in order to commence employment with Buyer.

other employee benefit plans, policies, programs or arrangements that contain
a service credit component and that are maintained by Buyer after the Closing
(solely to the extent applicable to such Hired Employee), credit each Hired
Employee with the applicable service credited for such Hired Employees
duration of employment by Seller (or any predecessor to Seller).

(d) Seller shall retain all liability under the Seller Plans. Any group
health plan established or maintained by Buyer (a "Buyer Health Plan") shall,
with respect to the Hired Employees, (i) waive any waiting period (except to
the extent such waiting period would have applied under any Seller group
health plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing), (ii) waive any
exclusion or limitation for preexisting conditions which were covered (with
respect to any Hired Employee and his or her covered dependents) under any
group health plan maintained by Seller prior to the Closing and (iii) grant
credit (for purposes of annual deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket
limits) for any covered claims incurred or payments made prior to the Closing
Date under any Seller group health plan during the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs. For purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
with respect to any Buyer Health Plan or any plan maintained by Buyer which
is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code, each
Hired Employee shall be granted credit for his or her years of service with
Seller prior to the Closing to the same extent as such Hired Employee was
granted credit for such service under any similar plan maintained by Seller.

(e) Seller shall retain responsibility for and continue to pay all medical
and dental plan benefits for each Hired Employee with respect to claims
incurred by such Hired Employee or his or her covered dependents under the
Seller Plans prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible, under its
employee benefit plans, for all expenses and benefits with  



 

55  respect to claims incurred by Hired Employees or their covered dependents on
or after the Closing Date, including, but not limited to, medical,
dental, disability, life insurance and workers compensation benefits. Buyer
shall be responsible for all workers compensation claims relating to any
Hired Employee incurred on or after the Closing Date.

sole responsibility for all Liabilities in respect of continuation coverage
of health insurance under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA or other similar state or local law to BSBU Employees, DCSS Employees
and any other current and former employees of Seller and their eligible
dependents with respect to "qualifying events" (as defined in Section 4980B
of the Code) occurring on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall be
responsible for satisfying all obligations under Section 4980B of the Code or
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or other similar state or local law with respect
to any Hired Employee and their eligible dependents with respect to
"qualifying events" occurring after the Closing Date.

9.3 _Employee Information_. Following the Execution Date, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with information and data
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with Buyers rights and
obligations under this _Article IX_, including exchanging information and
data relating to employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverages (except
to the extent prohibited by applicable Law).

have enacted, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree
or ruling, or taken any other action (including the failure to take action)
which, in either such case, has become final and non-appealable and has the
effect of making consummation of the Transactions illegal or
otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this _Section 10.1(a)(iii)_
shall not be available to any Party unless such Party shall have used its
commercially reasonable efforts to oppose any such action of a Governmental
Authority or to have such action of a Governmental Authority vacated or made
inapplicable to the Transaction; or

(i) Seller is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement,
and if Buyer is in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement of Buyer set forth in this Agreement and such breach (A) would
cause the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.1_ or _7.3_ not to be
satisfied and (B) is not cured by Buyer within ten (10) days after written

Seller as such Superior Transaction;  _provided_ , _however_ , that during
such fourteen (14) Business Day period, Seller shall have negotiated in good
faith with Buyer (to the extent that Buyer wishes to negotiate) to enable
Buyer to make such an offer; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event
of any amendment to the financial or other terms of such proposed Superior

Superior Transaction, and the fourteen (14) day period referenced above shall
be extended for an additional seven (7) Business Days after Buyers receipt of

Required Seller Stockholders have not yet approved the Agreement.

(c) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer, in writing, if:

(i) Buyer is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement,
and if Seller is in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant

and  



 

57  (B) is not cured by Seller within ten (10) days after written notice thereof
or, in the reasonable determination of Buyer, is incapable of being cured by

(a) Upon termination of this Agreement by a Party pursuant to _Section 10.1_,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Parties and this
Agreement shall terminate forthwith, and shall become void, and except
as expressly provided herein, there shall be no liability or obligation on
the part of the Parties or their respective Representatives. Termination of
this Agreement shall terminate all outstanding obligations and liabilities
between the Parties arising from this Agreement except those described in:
(i) _Section 8.1_, this _Article X_ , _Article XI_ and _Article XII_; (ii)
the Confidentiality Agreement; and (iii) any other provisions of
this Agreement which by their nature are intended to survive any such
termination. No termination of this Agreement shall release or be construed as
releasing any Party from any Liability to another Party which may have arisen,
in the first instance, under this Agreement prior to termination (e.g., for
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant).

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section
10.1(b)(ii)_ or by Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)(ii)_, then Seller
shall, no later than five (5) Business Days after such termination, pay to
Buyer an amount equal to (i) Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($8,500,000) (such payment, the "Termination Fee"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer in writing, and
Seller shall have no further obligation upon such termination and payment of
the Termination Fee to pay any amount with respect to Buyers expenses in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to  _Section 10.1(a)(iv)_, then Seller shall, no later
than five (5) Business Days after such termination, pay to Buyer an amount
equal to Buyers reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses actually
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, not to
exceed Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000). If, within twelve (12) months after
the Execution Date and subsequent to a termination pursuant to _Section
10.1(a)(iv)_, Seller consummates a transaction including the acquisition,
directly or indirectly, by any Person (other than Buyer) of at least fifty
percent (50%) of the shares of capital stock or other voting equity securities
of Seller, whether by stock purchase, merger or otherwise, or of the assets
of Seller, with terms at least as favorable to Seller in the aggregate as the
terms of the Transactions, upon consummation of such subsequent transaction,
then Seller shall, no later than five (5) Business Days after such
consummation, pay to Buyer the difference of (A) Eight Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($8,500,000), and (B) any amounts already paid to Buyer as
reimbursement of Buyers out-of-pocket expenses pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence. The Termination Fee is in no respect intended
by the Parties to constitute  



 

58  liquidated damages, or be viewed as an indicator of the damages payable, or
in any other respect limit or restrict damages available in case of any breach
of warranty, breach of covenant or other breach of this Agreement.

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this 
_Section 10.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and have been agreed
to by each of the Parties hereto in order to induce the other Parties to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, it being agreed
and acknowledged by each of them that the execution of this Agreement by them
constitutes full and reasonable consideration for such provisions. In the
event that Seller should fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, Seller
shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred
or accrued by Buyer (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in
connection with the collection under and enforcement of the provisions of this
_Section 10.2_, plus interest thereon at the rate of five percent (5%) per
annum.

defend Buyer, its Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, agents, Representatives, successors and
permitted assigns ("Buyer Indemnitees") against, and hold them harmless from,
any Losses incurred (payable promptly upon written request) by any Buyer
Indemnitee, to the extent arising from, in connection with, or otherwise with
respect to:



 

59 (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller that survives the
Effective Time and is contained in this Agreement or in any Other Agreement
(in each case disregarding, for purposes of determining the amount of Losses
relating thereto, any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect contained in any such representation or warranty); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person, and
shall not have any liability under this _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ to the extent
the liability or obligation is directly caused by any action taken or omitted
to be taken by any Buyer Indemnitee;

(ii) any breach of any covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement or in
any Other Agreement;

(iii) any Excluded Liability; and

(iv) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Seller to any

or suffered by Buyer that Seller is otherwise responsible for under _Section

"Indemnification Threshold"), at which time Seller shall be obligated to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for the entire amount of the Losses without
regard to the Indemnification Threshold; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
maximum liability of Seller for all claims by Buyer under _Section
11.2(a)(i)_, _(ii)_ and _(iv)_ together shall not in any case exceed twenty-
five percent (25%) of the Purchase Price (the "Cap"), and; provided, further,
that Seller shall have no indemnification obligations for Claims for which the
Losses are less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) per Claim (the

Claim Deductible Seller shall only be obligated for the Losses on such Claim
in excess of the Mini-Claim Deductible. Nothing in this Agreement (including
this _Section 11.2_) shall be deemed to limit or restrict any of the Buyer
Indemnitees rights to maintain or recover any amounts at any time in
connection with any action or claim based on fraud or intentional misconduct
of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller.

11.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to _Section 11.8_, Buyer shall
indemnify and defend Seller, its Affiliates and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, Representatives,
successors and permitted assigns ("Seller Indemnitees") against, and agrees to
hold them harmless from, any Losses sustained or incurred (payable promptly
upon written request by any Seller Indemnitee), to the extent arising from, in
connection with, or otherwise with respect to:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer that survives the
Effective Time and is contained in this Agreement or in any Other Agreement
(in each case disregarding, for purposes of determining the amount of Losses
relating thereto, any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect contained in any such representation or warranty); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to indemnify any Person, and
shall not have  



 

60  any liability under this _Section 11.3(a)_ to the extent the liability or
obligation is directly caused by any action taken or omitted to be taken by
any Seller Indemnitee;

(b) any breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any
Other Agreement;

(c) any Assumed Liability; and

(d) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Buyer to any
brokers, financial advisors or other comparable Persons retained or employed
by it in connection with the Transactions.

11.4 _Recoupment Against Escrow Agreement_. Any indemnification to which any
Buyer Indemnitee is entitled under this _Article XI_ as a consequence of any
Losses shall first be made as a payment to Buyer from the Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

11.5 _Calculation of Losses; Treatment of Indemnification Payments_.

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
_Section 11.2(a)_ or _Section 11.3_ shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party (as defined below) under insurance policies
with respect to such Loss and shall be (i) increased to take account of any
net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of
indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced
to take account of any net Tax benefit immediately realized by
the Indemnified Party in cash arising from the incurrence or payment of any
such Loss. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income,
gain, loss deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the
receipt of any indemnity payment under _Section 11.2(a)_ or _Section 11.3_
or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss.

(b) The amount of Losses recoverable by an Indemnified Party under _Section
11.2(a)_ or _Section 11.3_ shall be reduced by the amount of any payment
received from an insurance carrier or other third-party indemnitor by such
Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof) with respect to the Losses to
which such claim for indemnification relates, net of the cost of collection
and any increase in insurance cost resulting from such recovery. If an
Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate) receives any insurance payment in
connection with any claim for Losses for which it has already received an
indemnification or other third-party indemnity payment from the Indemnifying
Party, it shall pay to the Escrow Account, if the Escrow Agreement is still in
effect, otherwise to the Indemnifying Party (as defined below), within thirty
(30) days of receiving such insurance payment, an amount equal to the excess
of (i) the amount previously received by the Indemnified Party under _Section
11.2(a)_ or _Section 11.3_, as applicable, with respect to such claim plus
the amount of the insurance payments directly related to such claim received
by the Indemnified Party, over (ii) the amount of Losses with respect to such
claim which the Indemnified Party has become entitled to receive under
_Section 11.2(a)_ or  _Section 11.3_, as applicable.



 

61 (c) Any indemnity payment under _Section 11.2(a)_ or _Section 11.3_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the maximum extent
allowable under applicable Law, and for Tax purposes, unless a final
determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor
form) with respect to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates causes
any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to such price for federal
income Tax purposes.

11.6 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations of any Indemnifying
Party to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party, (a) pursuant to
_Section 11.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 11.3(a)_, shall terminate on March 31,
2009 (except to the extent that pursuant to _Section 11.1_ any representation
or warranty survives past such anniversary) and (b) pursuant to the other
clauses of _Section 11.2_ and  _Section 11.3_, shall not terminate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless
shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Indemnified Party
shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a
claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the
basis of such claim) pursuant to _Section 11.7_ to Indemnifying Party.

11.7 _Procedures_.

(a) In order for any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee (each, an
"Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under
this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any
Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such
Indemnified Party must notify the Party which may be required to indemnify the
Indemnified Party therefor (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing (and in
reasonable detail) of the Third-Party Claim within fifteen (15) Business Days
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure (except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnified Party
failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified
Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to
the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being
understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. The
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying
Party has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in
which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give notice of the Third-
Party Claim as provided above). If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or
prosecute a Third-Party Claim, all the Indemnified Parties shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the  



 

62  Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without
the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may
recommend and that by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the
full amount of the liability in connection with such Third-Party Claim, which
releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third-Party
Claim and that would not otherwise adversely affect the Indemnified Party.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 11.7(b)_, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to control, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole
control over, the defense or settlement of any claim if any of the following
conditions are not satisfied:

(i) the Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge in writing that it shall be
fully responsible, subject to _Sections 11.2(b)_ and _11.9_ , for all Losses
relating to such proceeding;

(ii) the Indemnifying Party must diligently defend such proceeding;

(iii) the Indemnifying Party must furnish the Indemnified Party with evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that the financial resources
of the Indemnifying Party (or the funds available in the Escrow Account), in
the Indemnified Partys reasonable judgment, are and will be sufficient (when
considering Losses in respect of all other outstanding claims) to satisfy any
Losses relating to such proceeding; and

(iv) such proceeding shall not involve criminal actions or allegations of
criminal conduct by the Indemnifying Party, and shall not involve claims for
specific performance or other equitable relief; and

(v) there does not exist, in the Indemnified Partys good faith judgment based
on the advice of outside legal counsel, a conflict of interest which, under
applicable principles of legal ethics, would reasonably be expected to
prohibit a single legal counsel from representing both the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party in such proceeding.

(d) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under _Section 11.2_ or _Section 11.3_ that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of
such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party and in any
event prior to the expiration of the underlying representations and
warranties, if applicable. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party  



 

63  under _Section 11.2_ or _Section 11.3_, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability
with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if
not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved through
arbitration proceedings (and not by litigation) consistent with _Section
12.8_.

11.8 _Sole Remedy; No Additional Representations_. Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein or in any Other Agreement and other than claims
of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or relating to breaches of
covenants requiring performance after the Execution Date, (a) each of Buyer
and Seller acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy after
the Effective Time with respect to any and all claims and causes of
action relating to this Agreement (including the Schedules), the Other
Agreements and the Transactions, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this  _Article XI_ or as provided in _Sections 12.8_
or _12.9_ , and (b) each of Buyer and Seller hereby waive on their own behalf
and on behalf of each other applicable Indemnified Party, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action it or they may have, now or in the future, against Buyer or Seller,
as the case may be, arising under or based upon any Federal, state or local
law, rule or regulation (including (i) any such rights, claims or causes of
action arising under or based upon common law or otherwise and (ii) any and
all claims for Losses, cost recovery or contribution arising under any
Environmental Law).

11.9 _Limitations on Liability_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer Indemnitees shall
be entitled to recover for Losses under _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ with respect to
any matters disclosed pursuant to _Section 6.8_ even if the Closing shall
have occurred, except in the case of Buyers waiver of a Closing condition
and the Closing hereunder, and then only with respect to the matters
specifically identified in such waiver.

(b) Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other in resolving
any claim or liability with respect to which one Party is obligated
to indemnify the other under this Agreement, including by making commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability.

12.4 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this

be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy such
determination shall not affect the enforceability of any others or of the
remainder of this Agreement.

12.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed by all of the
Parties hereto. This Agreement, the Other Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement contain the entire agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to
the Transactions, superseding all negotiations, prior discussions and
preliminary agreements made prior to the date hereof.

12.6 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise set forth under
_Article XI_ , this Agreement is solely for the benefit of the Parties hereto
and their respective Affiliates and no provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to confer upon any Person, other than the Parties, the Buyer
Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees any remedy, claim, liability,
reimbursement, claim of action or other right in excess of those existing
without reference to this Agreement.



 

66 12.7 _Waiver_. The failure of any Party to enforce any condition or part of
this Agreement at any time shall not be construed as a waiver of that
condition or part, nor shall it forfeit any rights to future enforcement
thereof.

12.8  _Governing Law; Arbitration_. This Agreement (including any claim or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by
the law of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law principles
that would result in the application of any Law other than the Laws of the
State of New York. In the event of any dispute, controversy or Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, the Other Agreements, or the
Transactions among any of the Parties hereto (other than with respect to the
determinations by the Accounting Arbitrator), the dispute shall be settled by
binding arbitration, before three (3) arbitrators, which shall be the sole and
exclusive procedure for the resolution of any such dispute. Within ten (10)
calendar days after receipt of a notice of intention to arbitrate sent by one
Party, each of Seller and Buyer shall designate in writing one (1) arbitrator
to resolve the dispute, which two (2) arbitrators shall, in turn, jointly
select a third arbitrator within twenty (20) calendar days of their
designation, failing which, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the
American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA. The arbitrators so designated (a)
shall each be experienced in commercial and business affairs and specifically
have expertise with businesses of types similar to that of the Biologics
SBU, (b) shall not be employees, consultants, officers or directors of any
Party or any Affiliate of any Party and (c) shall not have received any
compensation, directly or indirectly, from any Party or any Affiliate of any
Party during the two (2) year period preceding the Closing Date. The
arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the Commercial Rules of the AAA
but need not be administered by that organization. The Parties hereto shall
request the arbitrators to use their best efforts to rule on each disputed
issue within thirty (30) calendar days after the completion of the hearings;
provided, however, that the failure of the arbitrators to so rule during such
period shall not affect or impair the validity of any arbitration award. The
determination of the arbitrators as to the resolution of any dispute shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon all Parties hereto. All rulings of the
arbitrators shall be in writing, with the reasons for the ruling given, and
shall be delivered to the Parties hereto. Each Party shall pay the fees of its
respective designated arbitrator and its own costs and expenses of the
arbitration and the fees of the third arbitrator shall be paid fifty percent
(50%) by each of Seller and Buyer; provided, that the arbitrators shall have
the discretion to equitably allocate all fees and expenses of the arbitration
(both of the arbitrators and the Parties themselves) based on the nature and
outcome of the dispute. The place of the arbitration shall be New York, New
York. Any arbitration award may be entered in and enforced by any court having
jurisdiction thereof and the Parties hereby consent and submit to the
jurisdiction of the courts of any competent jurisdiction for purposes of the
enforcement of any arbitration award. The Parties agree that after a clear and
specific factual finding has been made with respect to a particular factual
matter by the arbitrators pursuant to this  _Section 12.8_ or by the
Accounting Arbitrator, such clear and specific factual finding shall be deemed
to have been finally determined by the Parties for all purposes under this
Agreement and, thereafter, no Party shall have the right to seek any contrary
determination in connection with any later arbitration proceeding.

12.9 _Injunctive Relief_. The Parties agree that if any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or is otherwise
breached, irreparable harm will occur, no adequate remedy at law will exist
and damages would be difficult to determine. Accordingly,  



 

67  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Party or
Parties not in breach will have the right to seek temporary injunctive relief
in any court of competent jurisdiction as may be available to such Party
under the laws and rules applicable in such jurisdiction with respect to any
matters arising out of another Partys performance of its obligations under
this Agreement. The Parties agree that in the event another Party institutes
an appropriate Action seeking injunctive/equitable relief for specific
performance under this Agreement, the Party seeking such relief shall not be
required to provide the other Parties with service of process of a complaint
and summons under the procedures set forth in any German or other non-United
States judicial process or system. Under such circumstances, the Party seeking
such relief need only provide the other Parties with two copies of a true,
correct and lawfully issued summons and complaint, via Federal Express
(priority delivery).

12.10 _Headings_. The headings of the Sections and subsections of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to
constitute a part hereof.

12.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by facsimile
by the Parties, in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed
an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument. This Agreement, any and all agreements and instruments
executed and delivered in accordance herewith, along with any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine or other means of electronic transmission, shall be treated in all
manner and respects and for all purposes as an original signature, agreement
or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.

12.12 _Construction_. The language in all parts of this Agreement shall be
construed, in all cases, according to its fair meaning. The Parties
acknowledge that each Party and its counsel have reviewed and revised this
Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities
are to be resolved against the drafting Party shall not be employed in the
interpretation of this Agreement.

12.13 _Parent Guaranty_. Parent hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guaranties and promises to pay and perform, upon Sellers
demand following default of Buyer, in lawful money of the United States of
America, any and all obligations of Buyer from time to time owed to Seller
under this Agreement, subject to any applicable cure period. Separate action
or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Parent, whether or not any
action is brought or prosecuted against Buyer or whether Buyer is joined in
any such action or actions. Parent further agrees that if Buyer shall fail to
fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement, Parent will perform the
same on demand as a principal obligor, and not as a surety. This is a
continuing guaranty of the obligations and may not be revoked and shall
not otherwise terminate unless and until the obligations have been
indefeasibly paid and performed in full. Parent represents and warrants that
it will personally receive a substantial economic benefit from the
Transactions giving rise to the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement.
Parent acknowledges that Seller would not execute this Agreement if it did not
receive this guaranty.

Agreement to be executed by their respective duly authorized officers as of
