Delaware corporation (" _Acquiror_ "), BCI New Co, Inc, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror (" _Merger Sub_ "),
Agencourt Bioscience Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Agencourt_ "),
and R. Brian McKernan, solely in his capacity as the initial Holder
Representative (as defined below) hereunder.

  



  

 ** _PLAN OF MERGER_**

  



  

A. The Boards of Directors of Acquiror, Merger Sub and Agencourt have each
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders
for Acquiror to acquire Agencourt upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

  



  

B. Acquiror, Merger Sub and Agencourt (Merger Sub and Agencourt sometimes
being referred herein to as the " _Constituent Corporations_ ") are hereby
adopting a plan of merger, providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and
into Agencourt, with Agencourt being the surviving corporation.  This merger
(the " _Merger_ ") will be consummated in accordance with this Agreement and
evidenced by a Certificate of Merger between Merger Sub and Agencourt in
substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Certificate of Merger_
"), such Merger to be consummated as of the Effective Time of the Merger (as
defined below).

  



  

C. In furtherance of such acquisition, the Boards of Directors of Acquiror,
Merger Sub and Agencourt have each approved the Merger in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), subject
to conditions set forth herein.

  



  

D. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and Agencourt, as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (hereinafter referred to for the periods on and after the Effective
Time of the Merger as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), shall continue its
corporate existence under the DGCL as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquiror.

  



  

E. On and after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation
shall thereupon and thereafter possess all of the rights, privileges, powers
and franchises, of a public as well as a private nature, of the Constituent
Corporations, and shall become subject to all the restrictions, disabilities
and duties of each of the Constituent Corporations; and all rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of each Constituent Corporation, and all
property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to each such
Constituent Corporation, on whatever account, and all choses in action
belonging to each such corporation, shall become vested in the Surviving
Corporation; and all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and
all and every other interest shall become thereafter the property of the
Surviving Corporation as they are of the Constituent Corporations; and the
title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise or any other interest
in real estate vested by any instrument or otherwise in either of such
Constituent Corporations shall not revert or become in any way impaired by
reason of the Merger; but all Liens upon any property of either Constituent
Corporation shall thereforth attach to the Surviving Corporation and shall be
enforceable against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and
duties had been incurred or contracted by it; all of the foregoing in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  



  

F. At the Effective Time of the Merger, the Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws of Agencourt shall become the Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided
therein and under the DGCL, and the directors and

  



  

1   

     
   

  



  

officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger shall become the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

G. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Acquiror and the
Founders, who hold, in the aggregate, a number of shares of Agencourt Common
Stock entitling the holders to cast votes in excess of that number of votes
necessary for the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby by the stockholders of Agencourt, have
entered into a voting agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ "), a copy of which
is attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , pursuant to which the Founders have
agreed to vote all shares of Agencourt Common Stock held by the Founders in
favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

H. For certain limited purposes, and subject to the terms set forth herein,
the Holder Representative shall serve as a representative of the Holders (as
defined below) of Agencourt Common Stock, Warrants and Converted Options.

  



  

I. Certain capitalized terms used herein have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in Article XI hereof.

  



  

 ** _AGREEMENT_**

  



  

In order to consummate the Merger, and in consideration of the mutual
agreements hereinafter contained, Acquiror, Merger Sub and Agencourt agree as
follows:

  



  

 **ARTICLE I**.  THE MERGER

  

 ** **

  

 **Section 1.1** ** ****Conversion of Agencourt Shares, Warrants and
Options**.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any Holder of Agencourt Common Stock, each share (a
" _Common Share_ ") of Agencourt Common Stock that is then issued and
outstanding (other than shares of Agencourt Common Stock, if any, held in the
treasury of Agencourt, which treasury shares shall be canceled as part of the
Merger, and other than shares of Agencourt Common Stock held by Persons who
object to the Merger and comply with the provisions of the DGCL concerning
the rights of holders of Agencourt Common Stock to dissent from the Merger
and require appraisal of their shares of Agencourt Common Stock ("
_Dissenting Stockholders_ "), which shares of Dissenting Stockholders will
not constitute "Common Shares" hereunder and shall hereafter be referred to
as " _Dissenting Shares_ "), each unexercised warrant to purchase Common
Shares that is then outstanding (such warrants being referred to as the "
_Warrants_ "), each unexercised option to purchase Common Shares (whether or
not vested) that is held by any Person that is not an employee of Agencourt
that is then outstanding (such options being referred to as the " _Non-
Employee Options_ ") and each unexercised option to purchase Common Shares
(to the extent such option is vested) that is held by any employee of
Agencourt that is then outstanding (such options being referred to as the "
_Vested Employee Options_ ," and together with the Non-Employee Options, the
" _Converted Options_ ") shall thereupon be converted into and become the
right to receive the applicable portion of the Total Consideration to Holders
as determined pursuant to this Article I.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Acquiror or Merger Sub, each share of common stock,
no par value per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one Common
Share of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(c) The " _Merger Consideration_ " shall consist of the sum of the Initial
Merger Consideration, the Contingent Merger Consideration, the Escrow Amount,
the Bonus Payments and the

  

   

     
   

  



  

Polony Payments. The " _Total Consideration to Holders_ " shall consist of
the sum of the Initial Merger Consideration, the Contingent Merger
Consideration and, to the extent due to them in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Amount. The " _Initial
Merger Consideration_ " shall consist of Ninety-Three Million ($93,000,000)
United States Dollars in cash, _less_ the sum of (i) the Estimated
Closing Date Funded Debt, (ii) the Estimated Net Current Asset Deficiency, if
the Closing Date Net Current Assets are estimated to be less than $0, _and_
 (iii) the amount of Holder Allocable Expenses paid by Acquiror to
the Holder Representative at Closing in accordance with Section 1.7. No later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Agencourt shall
prepare and deliver to Acquiror a written statement setting forth (x)
Agencourts estimate of the Funded Debt as of the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated Closing Date Funded Debt_ ") and (y) Agencourts estimate of the
Net Current Assets as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Date Net
Current Assets_ ").

  



  

(d) The Funding Amount shall be allocated among the holders of the Common
Shares, the Warrants and the Converted Options (each a " _Holder_ " and
jointly the " _Holders_ ") as set forth below in this Section 1.1(d). Subject
to Section 1.2(b), each Holder of Common Shares shall be entitled to receive
a portion of the Funding Amount equal to (i) the Cash Per Fully Diluted
Common Share, _multiplied by_ the number of Common Shares held by such Holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (but not including any
Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of any Warrants or Converted Options
held by such Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger),
_minus_  (ii) the amount of any Taxes required to be withheld under
applicable law with respect to such payments. Each Holder of Warrants shall
be entitled to receive a portion of the Funding Amount equal to (x) the Cash
Per Fully Diluted Common Share, _multiplied by_  the aggregate number of
Common Shares issuable upon exercise in full of all Warrants held by such
Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, _minus_ (y) the
aggregate cash exercise price payable upon exercise of all Warrants held by
such Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and _minus_
(z) the amount of any Taxes required to be withheld under applicable law with
respect to such payments. Each Holder of Converted Options shall be entitled
to receive a portion of the Funding Amount equal to (x) the Cash Per Fully
Diluted Common Share, _multiplied by_ the aggregate number of Common Shares
issuable upon exercise in full of all Converted Options (whether or not then
exercisable) held by such Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger, _minus_ (y) the aggregate cash exercise price payable upon
exercise of all Converted Options held by such Holder immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger and _minus_ (z) the amount of any Taxes
required to be withheld under applicable law with respect to such payments.
For purposes of the foregoing, the " _Cash Per Fully Diluted Common Share_ "
shall mean (A) the sum of (1) the Initial Merger Consideration, _plus_ (2)
the Aggregate Warrant Exercise Price (defined below), _plus_ (3) the
Aggregate Converted Option Exercise Price (defined below), _divided by_ (B)
the Aggregate Fully Diluted Common Shares.  The " _Aggregate Fully Diluted
Common Shares_ " shall be the sum of: (a) the aggregate number of Common
Shares held by all Holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger, _plus_ (b) the aggregate number of Common Shares issuable upon the
exercise in full of all Warrants held by all Holders immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, _plus_  (c) the aggregate number of Common
Shares issuable upon the exercise in full of all Converted Options (whether
or not then exercisable) held by all Holders immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, _plus_  (d) the aggregate number of Dissenting
Shares (if any). The " _Aggregate Warrant Exercise Price_ " shall mean the
sum of the exercise prices payable upon exercise in full of all Warrants held
by all Holders of Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger. The " _Aggregate Converted Option Exercise Price_ " shall mean the
sum of the exercise prices payable upon exercise in full of all Converted
Options held by all Holders of Converted Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger.

  



  

(e) All unvested options to acquire Common Shares held by employees of
Agencourt that are outstanding at the Effective Time (the " _Exchanged
Options_ ") shall be exchanged for deferred compensation credits under a plan
to be established by Acquiror (the " _Substitute Option Plan_ "). The
Substitute Option Plan will provide that the deferred compensation credit
with respect to each Exchanged

  

   

     
   

  



  

Option will have (i) a vesting schedule mutually agreed upon by the Holder
Representative and Acquiror and (ii) a value equal to (x) the
Total Consideration to Holders per share payable to Holders of Converted
Options _minus_  (y) the aggregate cash exercise price payable upon exercise
of all Exchanged Options held by such employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger. The deferred compensation credits will be
paid, less withholding under applicable law, as soon as administratively
feasible following the dates of vesting.

  



  

 **Section 1.2** ** ****Payment of the Funding Amount and Exchange of
Certificates**.

  



  

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Acquiror will pay
to an exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") selected by Agencourt and
reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount (the " _Funding Amount_ ") equal to the Initial Merger
Consideration _minus_ the product of (i) the number of Dissenting Shares (if
any) and (ii) the Cash Per Fully Diluted Common Share. Upon (A) payment
by Acquiror to the Exchange Agent of the Funding Amount and (B) payment
by Acquiror to the Holder Representative of the estimated Holder
Allocable Expenses pursuant to Section 1.7, Acquiror shall be deemed to have
satisfied its obligations to make payments in respect of the Merger
Consideration other than (1) Acquirors obligation to pay the Contingent
Merger Consideration, if and to the extent it comes due, in accordance with
Section 1.5, (2) the obligation of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation to
make payments to Dissenting Stockholders, if any, following the Effective
Time of the Merger, up to a maximum of the product of the number of
Dissenting Shares (if any) and the Cash Per Fully Diluted Common Share, (3)
the obligation of the Acquiror to pay to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount,
(4) the obligation of the Acquiror to pay to the Escrow Agent the Adjustment
Amount, if a positive number, pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(v), (5) the
obligation of the Acquiror or Surviving Corporation to make the Bonus
Payments and (5) the obligation of the Acquiror to make the Polony Payments.

  



  

(b) After the Effective Time of the Merger, each Holder of an outstanding
certificate or certificates for Common Shares, Warrants or Converted Options
(collectively, the " _Certificates_ "), upon surrender of such Certificates
to the Exchange Agent (or, in the case of a Holder of Converted Options, upon
delivery of a Holder Acknowledgment to the Exchange Agent), shall be entitled
to receive from the Exchange Agent on Acquirors behalf in exchange therefor
such portion of the Funding Amount calculated in accordance with Section
1.1(d); _provided_ , _however_ , that any payment shall be reduced by the
amount of any Taxes required to be withheld under applicable law with respect
to such payments and amounts so withheld shall be paid by the Exchange Agent
to the Surviving Corporation for disbursement to the applicable Governmental
Authority. Pending such surrender and exchange (or, in the case of a Holder
of Warrants or Converted Options, upon such delivery of a Holder
Acknowledgment), a Holders Certificate or Certificates representing
the Common Shares, Warrants or Converted Options shall be deemed for all
purposes (other than the exchange contemplated by this Section 1.2) to
evidence a right to receive such Holders applicable portion of the Total
Consideration to Holders.

  



  

(c) Promptly following the date which is the earlier of (i) the date upon
which the Exchange Agent has received Certificates and Holder
Acknowledgements representing all Common Shares, Warrants or Converted
Options that are outstanding at the Effective Time (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares) and has dispersed the entire Funding Amount
or (ii) one (1) year after the Effective Time of the Merger, Acquiror will
instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to Acquiror all cash, Certificates,
Holder Acknowledgments and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Exchange Agents duties will
terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares) and each holder of Warrants or Converted
Options who has not delivered a Holder Acknowledgment may surrender such
Certificate or deliver such Holder Acknowledgement to Acquiror and (subject
to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive in
consideration therefor, and Acquiror will promptly pay, such

  

   

     
   

  



  

Holders applicable portion of the Total Consideration to Holders, without
any interest thereon other than with respect to the Escrow Amount pursuant to
Section 9.2(g) and Section 9.2(h).

  



  

(d) In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Funding Amount deliverable
in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Article I.

  



  

(e) The Contingent Merger Consideration shall be allocated among the Holders
of the Common Shares, the Warrants and the Converted Options. Each Holder
shall be entitled to receive a portion of the Contingent Merger Consideration
equal to the product of (i) such Holders Applicable Percentage, _multiplied
by_  (ii) the aggregate Contingent Merger Consideration payable to all
Holders, if any.

  



  

(f) The Escrow Amount shall be allocated among the Holders of the Common
Shares, the Warrants and the Converted Options. Each Holder shall be
entitled to receive a portion of the Escrow Amount to the extent due to them
in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement equal to the
product of (i) such Holders Applicable Percentage, _multiplied by_  (ii)
the aggregate Escrow Amount payable to all Holders, if any.

  



  

(g) The Bonus Payments shall be allocated among those employees of the
Surviving Corporation at such times, in such amounts and to such employees
(including the Founders) as mutually agreed by the Holder Representative and
Acquiror in accordance with Section 5.3(f).

  



  

(h) _Withholding Taxes_.  The Founders shall cause Agencourt to calculate the
proper amount of Taxes required to be withheld for each Holder and/or
required to be paid by Agencourt with respect to each distribution of the
Total Consideration to Holders. Such Tax withholding information shall be
provided to the Escrow Agent, the Exchange Agent, the Holder Representative,
the Surviving Corporation and the Acquiror, as applicable, in order to permit
them to make the distributions to Holders required by this Agreement and to
remit the applicable Tax withholding amount to the Surviving Corporation.
Acquiror shall cause, with the cooperation of the Founders, the Surviving
Corporation to deposit such Tax withholdings on a timely basis with the
relevant taxing authorities.

  



  

 **Section 1.3** ** ****Effective Time of the Merger; Closing Date**. On the
Closing Date, Merger Sub and Agencourt shall cause the Certificate of Merger,
effective as of the Closing Date, to be executed and filed with the Secretary
of State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. For purposes of
this Agreement, the " _Effective Time of the Merger_ " shall mean the time at
which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed in the Office of the
Secretary of the State of Delaware and has become effective in accordance
with the DGCL; and the term " _Closing Date_ " shall mean the date that is
five (5) Business Days after the date on which all of the conditions set
forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or waived, or such other date as
Acquiror and Agencourt may mutually agree.

  



  

 **Section 1.4** ** ****Adjustments to Merger Consideration**.

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within sixty (60) days thereof, the Holder Representative shall
prepare, cause Agencourts certified public accountants to audit and opine
upon and deliver to Acquiror (i) a consolidated balance sheet of Agencourt
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the Closing (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ "), (ii) a calculation of the aggregate principal amount of all Funded
Debt of Agencourt and its consolidated Subsidiaries, if any, as of the
Closing Date as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Date
Funded Debt_ "), and (iii) a calculation of the Net Current Assets as of the
Closing Date as set forth on the Closing Balance

  

   

     
   

  



  

Sheet (the " _Closing Date Net Current Assets_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet
shall be prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistent with the preparation of the
historical consolidated financial statements of Agencourt and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, and shall fairly present the consolidated
financial position of Agencourt and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
Closing. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared using the same
accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in
preparation of the Audited Financial Statements. Following the Closing,
Acquiror shall provide the Holder Representative and its representatives
access to the records and employees of Agencourt and its Subsidiaries to the
extent necessary for the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and shall
cause the employees of Agencourt to cooperate with the Holder Representative
and its representatives in connection with its preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet.

  



  

(b) If Acquiror shall disagree with the calculation of the Closing Date
Funded Debt or the Closing Date Net Current Assets, it shall notify the
Holder Representative of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in
reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, within sixty(60) days
after its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that Acquiror
does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such sixty (60) day
period, Acquiror shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet
and the calculation of the Closing Date Funded Debt and the Closing Date Net
Current Assets delivered by the Holder Representative, which shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such
notice of disagreement is timely provided, Acquiror and the
Holder Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period
of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the Closing Date
Funded Debt or the Closing Date Net Current Assets.  If, at the end of such
period, they are unable to resolve any such disagreements, then an
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing mutually selected
by Acquiror and the Holder Representative (the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve
any remaining disagreements.  Each party will submit to the Auditor such work
papers and other documents and information related to the disputed issues as
the Auditor may request and are available to that party or its independent
public accountants and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Auditors any material related to the determination and to discuss the
determination with the Auditor. The Auditor shall determine as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of the date on which
such dispute is referred to the Auditor, whether the Closing Balance Sheet
was prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 1.4(a) and
(only with respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the
Auditor) whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Date Funded Debt or
the Closing Date Net Current Assets requires adjustment.  The fees and
expenses of the Auditor shall be paid one-half by Acquiror and one-half by
the Holder Representative as a Holder Allocable Expense pursuant to Section
1.7. The determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the parties. The date on which the Closing Date Funded Debt and the
Closing Date Net Current Assets are finally determined in accordance with
this Section 1.4(b) is hereinafter referred as to the "
_Determination Date_."

  



  

(c) Based on the determination of the final Closing Date Funded Debt and
Closing Date Net Current Assets pursuant to Section 1.4(b), the Escrow Amount
shall be adjusted as follows:

  



  

(i) The " _Funded Debt Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or
negative, shall mean the Estimated Closing Date Funded Debt _minus_ the
Closing Date Funded Debt.

  



  

(ii) The " _NCA Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be a positive or negative
number, shall mean the following: (A) if the Estimated Closing Date Net
Current Assets is positive and the Closing Date Net Current Assets is
positive, then the Closing Date Net Current Assets _minus_  the Estimated Net
Current Assets, (B) if the Estimated Closing Date Net Current Assets is
positive and the Closing Date Net Current Assets is negative, then the
Closing Date Net Current Assets _minus_ the Estimated Closing Date
Net Current Assets, (C) if the Estimated Closing Date Net Current Assets is

  

   

     
   

  



  

negative and the Closing Date Net Current Assets is positive, then the sum of
the absolute value of the Estimated Closing Date Net Current Assets _plus_
 the Closing Date Net Current Assets, and (D) if the Estimated Closing Date
Net Current Assets is negative and the Closing Date Net Current Assets is
negative, then the Closing Date Net Current Assets _minus_ the Estimated
Closing Date Net Current Assets.

  



  

(iii) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be a positive or negative
number, shall mean the sum of the Funded Debt Adjustment Amount and the NCA
Adjustment Amount.

  



  

(iv) The " _Escrow Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be a positive or negative
number, shall mean the sum of the of the Estimated Net Current Asset Surplus,
if any, _plus_ (ii) the Adjustment Amount (positive or negative) _minus_
(iii) the Uncollected Receivables.

  



  

(v) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then Acquiror shall pay
such Adjustment Amount, within fifteen (15) days after the Determination
Date, to the Escrow Agent to be included in the Escrow Amount.

  



  

(vi) If the Escrow Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Escrow
Agent shall pay the Escrow Adjustment Amount, within fifteen (15) days after
the Determination Date, to the Holders in accordance to Section 1.2(f).

  



  

(vii) If the Escrow Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the Escrow
Agent shall pay, within fifteen (15) days after the Determination Date, to
the Acquiror from the Escrow Amount the absolute value of the Escrow
Adjustment Amount without any threshold amount and without any limit (other
than the sum of the Escrow Amount and the Contingent Merger Consideration).
If such Escrow Adjustment Amount is greater than the Escrow Amount, then
Acquiror shall have the right to offset the difference from the Contingent
Merger Consideration.

  



  

 **Section 1.5** ** ****Contingent Payments. **Subject to the remainder of
this Section 1.5 and contingent upon the occurrence of the events and
achieving the goals set forth herein, the Acquiror shall make the payments
set forth below in Section 1.5(a) and Section 1.5(b) (collectively, the "
_Contingent Merger Consideration_ ") to the Holders in accordance with
Section 1.2(e).

_provided_ , _however_ , no payment shall be made prior to January 1, 2006,
even if such a product is delivered and such a payment is earned prior to
such date. If said second product is delivered after December 31, 2007, the

  

   

     
   

  



  

amount due will be reduced by $1,000,000 for each 6 month period of delay in
delivering such products provided that, if such second product is
not delivered to Acquiror by June 30, 2009 then no Contingent Merger
Consideration Payment will be made for such second product.

  



  

(iii) A product in _Schedule 1.5(a)_ shall be considered as delivered when
the Acquiror is in receipt of (A) a product meeting all of the specifications
therefore in _Schedule 1.5(a)_, and (B) all of the documents for that
product specified in _Schedule 1.5(a)_.

  



  

(iv) Contingent upon the Surviving Corporation having "delivered" to the
Acquiror (as the root word "delivered" is defined above), at any time after
the Closing and prior to thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date, in
any order, products three through eight identified in _Schedule
1.5(a)_, Acquiror shall pay to the Holders for each such delivered product
within such time the sum of Two Million ($2,000,000) United States Dollars;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , no payment shall be made prior to January 1, 2006
even if such a product is delivered and such a payment is earned prior to
such date.

  



  

(b) _Net Revenue and Operating Income Contingent Payments_. Within fifteen
(15) days after completion of the 2007 year-end audit of the Surviving
Corporation, Acquiror shall pay to the Holders the sum of Ten Million
($10,000,000) United States Dollars for each of the Net Revenue Targets and
Operating Income Targets set forth on Schedule 1.5(b) achieved by the
Surviving Corporation during the 2007 calendar year. Within 15 days after
completion of the 2006 year-end audit of the Surviving Corporation, Acquiror
shall pay to the Holders the sum of Three Million Three Hundred Thirty-Three
Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Three ($3,333,333) United States Dollars for
each of the Net Revenue Targets and Operating Income Targets set forth on
Schedule 1.5(b) achieved by the Surviving Corporation during the 2006
calendar year. If the Surviving Corporation achieves the 2007 Net Revenue
Targets or the 2007 Operating Income Targets in the 2006 calendar year, the
entire Ten Million ($10,000,000) United States Dollars (or Twenty Million
($20,000,000) United States Dollars if both are achieved) shall be due and
payable to the Holders on January 8, 2008. Any Contingent Merger Consideration
paid to Holders for achieving 2006 Net Revenue Targets and 2006 Operating
Income Targets shall be deducted from any Contingent Merger Consideration due
and payable for achieving 2007 Net Revenue Targets and 2007 Operating
Income Targets.

  



  

(c) _Obligations of Acquiror; Events of Acceleration_. Acquiror agrees to use
reasonable commercial efforts to timely perform its obligations set forth in
_Schedule 1.5(a)_ (collectively, the " _Contingent Obligations_ "). Acquiror
acknowledges that the ability of the Holders to earn the Contingent Merger
Consideration is dependent on the Founders being able to operate and manage
the Surviving Corporation substantially in accordance with the financial
operating plan attached hereto as _Schedule 1.5(c)_. The entire Contingent
Merger Consideration shall immediately become due and payable if Acquiror
takes any action that, if not cured within 45 days after receipt of written
notice from the Founders, would have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Holders ability to earn the Contingent Merger Consideration. For
avoidance of doubt, without limiting the foregoing, the termination of any
Founder without Good Cause or the relocation of the facility or the transfer
of any employees of the Surviving Corporation to another Acquiror location
without the consent of the Founders shall be deemed to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Holders ability to earn the Contingent Merger
Consideration.

  



  

 **Section 1.6** ** ****Escrow Amount.**  On the Closing Date, an amount
equal to Seven Million ($7,000,000) United States Dollars _plus_ the
Estimated Net Current Asset Surplus, if the Estimated Closing Date Net
Current Assets exceed $0 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") shall be paid by Acquiror
to a mutually agreed upon escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") to be held in
escrow and used for the purposes of and in accordance with Section 1.4(c) and
Article IX. The Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms of an Escrow Agreement in the form attached
hereto as

  

   

     
   

  



  

 _Exhibit C_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") and distributed to the
Holders or the Acquiror, as the case may be, in accordance with Section
1.2(f), Section 1.4(c) and Article IX.

  



  

 **Section 1.7** ** ****Holder Allocable Expenses. **On or prior to the
Closing Date, the Holder Representative will provide to Acquiror an estimate
(which estimate may include such reserves as the Holder Representative
determines in good faith to be appropriate for any Holder Allocable Expenses
that are not then known and determinable) of the following fees and expenses
that may be incurred by the Holder Representative on behalf of Agencourt and
the holders of Common Shares, Warrants and/or Converted Options in connection
with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby: (a) the fees and
disbursements of special outside counsel to Agencourt and/or the Holder
Representative incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (b) the fees and expenses of any other agents, advisors, consultants
and experts employed by Agencourt and/or the Holder Representative in
connection with the Merger, (c) if necessary, one-half of the fees and
expenses of the Auditor and (d) the expenses of the Holder Representative
incurred in such capacity (the " _Holder Allocable Expenses_ "). In no
event will Acquiror or the Holder Representative be responsible for payment
of Holder Allocable Expenses in excess of the cash amounts paid to the Holder
Representative by Acquiror under this Section 1.6.  Immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger and concurrently with the payment to the
Exchange Agent of the Funding Amount in accordance with Section 1.2(a),
Acquiror shall pay to the Holder Representative by wire transfer of
immediately available funds an amount equal to the Holder Allocable Expenses.
Any unused reserve for Holder Allocable Expenses shall be allocated and
distributed to the Holders in accordance with each Holders Applicable
Percentage, at such time as the Holder Representative reasonably determines
that there all Holder Allocable Expenses have been paid and no further Holder
Allocable Expenses are likely to arise.

  



  

 **Section 1.8** ** ****Dissenting Shares**. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Article I, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a
right to receive the Total Consideration to Holders and the holders thereof
shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL.
Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such
shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor
from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have
failed to establish such holders entitlement to dissenters rights as
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, or (b) if any such holder of Dissenting
Shares shall have effectively withdrawn such holders demand for appraisal of
such shares or lost such holders right to appraisal and payment for such
holders shares under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder shall forfeit the
right to appraisal of such shares and each such share shall not constitute a
Dissenting Common Share and shall be treated as if it had been converted, as
of the Effective Time of the Merger, into a right to such holders Applicable
Percentage of the Total Consideration to Holders as provided in Section 1.2,
without interest thereon other than with respect to the Escrow Amount
pursuant to Section 9.2(g) and Section 9.2(h).

  



  

 **Section 1.9** ** ****Tax Returns**.  The Founders shall cause the proper
officers and employees of Agencourt to prepare and file all Tax Returns of
Agencourt that are required to be filed for taxable years or periods ending
on or before the Effective Time of the Merger. To the extent the Taxes due
on such Tax Returns were accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Surviving Corporation and/or Acquiror shall pay the Taxes using the amount
accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet. If there is a shortfall in the accrued
amount versus the actual Taxes due and there are no Tax attributes arising
before the Effective Time of the Merger available to offset such shortfall,
including but not limited to Net Operating Loss carryovers, RandD tax credits
and Tax deductions resulting from the Converted Options and bonus payments
made within 75 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, such shortfall
shall be deducted from the Escrow Amount and paid to Acquiror without any
threshold amount and without any limit (other than the sum of the Escrow
Amount and the Contingent Merger Consideration). If such shortfall is

  

   

     
   

  



  

greater than the Escrow Amount, then Acquiror shall have the right to offset
the difference from the Contingent Merger Consideration. If the accrued
amount is greater than the actual Taxes due, such excess shall be added to
Escrow Amount and deposited by Acquiror with the Escrow Agent and distributed
to the Holders or the Acquiror, as the case may be, in accordance with
Section 1.2(f), Section 1.4(c) and Article IX. Such Tax Returns will be
prepared consistently with the Tax practices following previously filed Tax
Returns of Agencourt and its Subsidiaries and in accordance with the most
recent Tax practices as to elections and accounting methods of Agencourt and
its Subsidiaries. Acquiror shall file or cause the Surviving Corporation to
file when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed for taxable years
or periods ending after the Effective Time of the Merger and shall pay any
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

the operations of Agencourt and its Subsidiaries, to all of their respective

Section 13.9 to the extent permitted under Section 251 of the DGCL.

  



  

 **Section 4.5 Notification**. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time of the Merger, Agencourt will notify Acquiror in writing
if Agencourt becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or
constitutes a breach of any of Agencourts representations and warranties as
of the date of this Agreement or if Agencourt becomes aware of the occurrence
after the date of this Agreement of any fact or condition that would cause or
constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or
discovery of such fact or condition. Should any fact or condition require a
modification of any of the Disclosure Schedules of Article II if such
Disclosure Schedule were dated as of the date of the occurrence or discovery
of any such fact or condition, Agencourt will promptly deliver to Acquiror a
supplement to such Disclosure Schedule specifying such change. By delivering
such supplement to the Disclosure Schedule, any breach of any representation
or warranty shall be deemed cured and, subject to the next two sentences

such other amendments to this Agreement as are equitable under the
circumstances to reflect the effect of such supplement on the operations or
prospects of Agencourt. If the parties cannot agree on such adjustment
and/or amendments then this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with
Section 10.1(c). If Acquiror consummates the Closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Acquiror shall be deemed to have waived any
breach of any such representation or warranty which has been cured by a
supplement to the Disclosure Schedule. During the same period Agencourt will
promptly notify Acquiror in writing if any of the conditions of Article VIII
is impossible or unlikely.

their directors, officers and employees not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or proposals from, discuss or
negotiate with, provide any non-public information to, or consider the merits
of any unsolicited inquiries or proposals from any Person (other than
Acquiror) relating to any transaction involving the sale of the business or
assets of Agencourt or any of its Subsidiaries (other than in the

capital stock of Agencourt or any of its subsidiaries or any merger,
consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction.

compensation in an amount consistent with Acquirors then standard practice
in the United States.

accounting, information services, other mutually agreed support services, the
use of equipment and instruments located in the Surviving Corporations
premises, and the use and occupation by Newco of approximately 8,000 to
10,000 square feet of the Surviving Corporations premises (the " _Polony
Services_ "). All activities of Newco will be conducted by employees of the
Surviving Corporation.  All funds received by the Surviving Corporation under
the Polony Grants shall be used by the Surviving Corporation to provide the
Polony Services on Newcos behalf and shall not be counted towards the Polony
Payments. In the event that the funds paid to the Surviving Corporation under
the Polony Grants are reduced, then the amount of the Polony Payments, at
Acquirors option, may be reduced proportionally. Acquiror and Surviving
Corporation shall not take any action or fail to take any action that would
have a Material Adverse Effect on APG.

  



  

(c) The Surviving Corporation and Acquiror acknowledge and agree that Newco
commissioned the Surviving Corporation to perform the Polony Services for
Newco and that all right, title and interest to inventions, trade secrets,
intellectual property and other work product developed or resulting from the
Polony Services provided by the Surviving Corporation to Newco under the
Polony Grants (the " _Polony Work Product_ ") is owned by Newco in the
entirety both as: (i) "works made for hire" (to the extent permitted by law)
in which Newco owns all copyrights as the author and all other intellectual
property and proprietary rights and (ii) the exclusive owner or assignee of
all rights to the Polony Work Product, including all rights of authorship,
inventions, ideas, concepts, know-how and techniques. To the extent that any
works within the Polony Work Product may not be considered "works made for
hire" under the United States copyright laws, and to the extent that any
rights to the Polony Work Product may be vested in any person other than
Newco, the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror hereby irrevocably grant and
assign to Newco such rights as they may possess, and represent and covenant
to use reasonable commercial efforts to cause such third party to irrevocably
grant and assign to Newco, in each case free and clear of any liens, claims
or encumbrances, each and every right in the Polony Work Product throughout
the world, including all copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and all
other intellectual property and proprietary rights, together with all
renewals and extensions thereto, and the right to bring actions for past and
future infringement. Such grant and assignment shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Newco and the Surviving Corporation. The Polony Work Product
shall be deemed to be Confidential Information of Newco, and the Surviving
Corporation and Acquiror agree to maintain its confidentiality in the same
manner as they use to protect their own confidential information.
The Surviving Corporation and Acquiror waive any and all rights of
attribution they may have in any of the Polony Work Product pursuant to 17
U.S.C. §106A of the United States copyright laws and any right of privacy or
publicity for the Polony Work Product.

  



  

(d) If, at any time, Newco decides to distribute (whether directly or
indirectly and whether under its own name and trademarks or under the name
and trademarks of another Person) to other than a relatively small target
group (not to exceed 10 customers, worldwide) one or more products within the
scope of the Polony Work Product then before Newco enters into any agreement
with any other Person or otherwise takes any steps to implement such decision
Newco shall notify Acquiror in writing of such decision and offer Acquiror
the right and license to distribute such product or products in such market
or markets and in such territory or territories as Newco may elect. Such
offer shall be on commercially reasonable terms and conditions.  Acquiror
shall be given not less than sixty (60) days to accept or reject such offer;
provided that, if Acquiror rejects such offer Newco will not grant any other
Person the right to distribute such products in such market or markets and in
such territory or territories on terms more favorable than those offered to
Acquiror without first offering such more favorable terms to Acquiror. If
Acquiror accepts such offer Newco agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly conclude an agreement with Acquiror on the offered and
accepted terms. In the event that Newco grants a license to any Polony Work
Product to a Person that manufactures, sells or otherwise distributes in
vitro diagnostics products or offers in vitro diagnostic services to others
or otherwise enables such a Person to distribute the Polony Work Product or
any of it or to practice any processes or

  

   

     
   

  



  

offer any services within the scope of the Polony Work Product, Acquiror will
receive a license to such Polony Work Product for in vitro diagnostic
applications, products and services on terms substantially similar to the
other licensee.

  



  

(e) The parties agree that goal of Newco is to use the contributed
intellectual property to develop a process and products for the low cost
sequencing of the human genome or significant portions of such genome so that
it is economically feasible to sequence the genome or significant portions
thereof of a large number of individuals. The parties further agree that it is
the intention of Newco to either offer a human genome sequencing service to
others or to offer such products and processes to other Persons who will
provide such services. If, during the development of such products and
processes an invention is made or know-how is developed that (i) is of
economic value to the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, and (ii) does not
directly compete with the intended services of Newco or the intended products
and processes Newco will offer to others, then, subject to the remainder of
this paragraph, Acquiror shall have a right to be a licensee of
such invention or know-how. Subject to the remainder of this paragraph,
Acquiror may, at any time, request, in writing, a license under such
invention or know-how.  Newco will promptly, but in no event later than
thirty (30) days after receipt of such request offer Acquiror a license on
commercially reasonable terms and, if another Person has already been granted
a license under such invention or know-how, then on terms at least as
favorable as those granted to such other Person. Acquiror shall have thirty
(30) days to accept or reject such offer; provided that, if Acquiror rejects
such offer Newco will not grant any other Person the right to be a licensee
of such invention or know-how on terms more favorable than those offered to
Acquiror without first offering such more favorable terms to Acquiror. If
Acquiror accepts such offer Newco agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly conclude an agreement with Acquiror on the offered and
accepted terms. Newco may at any time offer Acquiror a license under such
invention or know-how; such offer (which may be for an exclusive license)
shall be in writing and shall be under commercially reasonable terms. If
Acquiror rejects such offer then Newco agrees it will not grant any other
Person the right to be a licensee (or the licensee) of such invention or
know-how on terms more favorable than those offered to Acquiror without first
offering such more favorable terms to Acquiror. If Acquiror accepts such
offer Newco agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
conclude an agreement with Acquiror on the offered and accepted terms.

  



  

(f) Newco shall have the right (i) to directly through its own sales force
sell the Polony Work Product to a relatively small target group (not to
exceed 10 customers worldwide), (ii) to run its business as a stand-alone
entity at any point in time, (iii) to purchase, at fair market value, any
equipment or assets of the Surviving Corporation specifically dedicated to
the Polony project, and, (iv) if and when Newco decides to establish itself
as a stand alone entity, offer employment to any of those employees who at
the time of such offer spend more than eighty percent (80%) of their work
time on the Polony project; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no offers shall be
made prior to December 31, 2007 to the Founders or any other employees
primarily engaged in the business of the Surviving Corporation. If Newco
hires any employees from the Surviving Corporation, Acquiror may, at its
option, cease making the Polony Payments.

  



  

(g) Newco will release, defend, indemnify and hold Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation, harmless (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and
expenses in the consideration of defense and in the defense, and any awards
(including interest and penalties thereon) made by a court of competent
jurisdiction or agreed to by Newco in compromise or settlement thereof), from
and against any claims, liabilities and Losses, of any kind or nature and
brought by any Person (including Newco, the Holders or any of them and any
third Person) resulting from or arising out of or associated with the
provision of the Polony Services, the development of the Polony Work Product,
and the manufacture or use of any product or the practice of any process
within the scope of the Polony Work Product other than as a result of
Acquirors breach of this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement.

  

   

     
   

  



  

(h) The Holders will release the Surviving Corporation from any claim,
liability or loss they may have or suffer (individually or as a class)
resulting from or arising out of or associated with the provision of the
Polony Services, the development of the Polony Work Product, and the
manufacture or use of any product or the practice of any process within the
scope of the Polony Work Product other than as a result of Acquirors breach
of this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement.

  



  

(i) The Holders of Agencourt will, at their own expense, cause an appraisal
of the assets of Agencourt to be contributed to Newco pursuant to Section
6.3(a) hereof, which appraisal shall be used to determine the gain for Tax
purposes resulting from (i) said contribution of assets and (ii) the dividend
of 51% of Newco shares also provided for in Section 6.3(a) hereof. A copy of
such appraisal will be provided to Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(j) Agencourt shall accrue on the Closing Balance Sheet for any Taxes which
shall be due as a result of either (i) the formation of Newco and the
contribution by Agencourt of assets to Newco contemplated in Section 6.3(a)
and (ii) the dividend of 51% of Newco shares provided for in Section 6.3(a)
hereof. The Holders will indemnify the Surviving Corporation and/or Acquiror
for the full amount (without any threshold amount and without any limit other
than the sum of the Escrow Amount and the Contingent Merger Consideration) of
any Tax imposed upon the Surviving Corporation that exceeds the amount
accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet for such Taxes and any Tax attributes of
Agencourt arising before the Effective Time of the Merger and available to
reduce such Taxes, including but not limited to Net Operating Loss
carryovers, RandD tax credits and Tax deductions resulting from the Converted
Options and bonus payments made within 75 days after the Effective Time of
the Merger, and such shortfall shall be deducted from the Escrow Amount and
paid to Acquiror. If such shortfall is greater than the Escrow Amount, then
Acquiror shall have the right to offset the difference from the Contingent
Merger Consideration. If the accrued amount is greater than the actual Taxes
due, such excess shall be added to Escrow Amount and deposited by Acquiror
with the Escrow Agent and distributed to the Holders or the Acquiror, as the
case may be, in accordance with Section 1.2(f), Section 1.4(c) and Article
IX. Such Tax Returns will be prepared consistently with the Tax practices
following previously filed Tax Returns of Agencourt and its Subsidiaries and
in accordance with the most recent Tax practices as to elections and
accounting methods of Agencourt and its Subsidiaries.

 **Section 9.2 Indemnification**.

  



  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 9.2, Acquiror and Merger Sub
and their respective managers, officers, directors, partners, stockholders,
employees, members and Affiliates (the " _Acquiror Indemnified Parties_ ")
shall be entitled to indemnification, only from the Escrow Amount and in
accordance with Section 9.2(e) the Contingent Merger Consideration, from and
against any and all Losses, whether or not involving any third party claim,
arising out of, resulting from or relating directly or indirectly from or in
connection with (i) any breach on the date hereof or the Closing Date of any
representation or warranty of Agencourt contained in Article II hereof or set
forth in the corresponding Disclosure Schedules attached hereto (after giving
effect to any supplement to a Disclosure Schedule) or in a supplement to a
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or document delivered by Agencourt
pursuant to Article VIII hereof (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
of Agencourt contained herein, (iii) amounts paid to the Dissenting
Shareholders either (A) pursuant to agreement between the Acquiror, the
Holder Representative and the Dissenting Shareholders or (B) awarded to the
Dissenting Shareholders by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL, or (iv) any product shipped or service performed by
Agencourt or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 9.2, Holders of Common Shares,
Warrants and Converted Options entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (
_pro rata_ , in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages) and
their respective managers, officers, directors, members, stockholders,
employees and Affiliates (the " _Agencourt Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be
entitled to indemnification from Acquiror and Merger Sub, jointly and
severally, from and against any and all Losses, whether or not involving any
third party claim, arising out of, resulting from or relating to (i) any
breach on the date hereof or on the Closing Date of any representation or
warranty of Acquiror or Merger Sub contained in Article III hereof or any
officers certificate delivered pursuant to Article VIII hereof or (ii) any
breach of any covenant or agreement of Acquiror or Merger Sub contained
herein.

  



  

(c) If a claim for Losses (a " _Claim_ ") is to be made by an indemnified
party, such indemnified party shall give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_
") to the party against whom such Claim is being asserted (the recipient of
such notice referred to below as the "indemnifying party"), promptly after
such indemnified party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event which
may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may be sought under this
Section 9.2.  If any lawsuit or other action is filed or instituted against
any indemnified party with respect to a matter subject to indemnity
hereunder, notice thereof (a " _Third Party Notice_ ") shall be given to
the indemnifying party as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
thirty (30) days after the service of the citation or summons). After receipt
of a Third Party Notice, the indemnifying party shall have the right by
providing written notice acknowledging such

  

   

     
   

  



  

indemnifying partys obligation to indemnify the indemnified party to (i)
take control of the defense and investigation of such lawsuit or action, (ii)
employ and engage attorneys of its own choice (subject to the approval of the
indemnified party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to handle
and defend the same, at the indemnifying partys sole cost, risk and expense,
and (iii) compromise or settle such claim, which compromise or settlement
shall be made only with the written consent of the indemnified party.  The
indemnified party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
indemnifying party and such attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense
of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom and
the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for all of
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith; and the
indemnified party may, at its own cost, participate in the investigation,
trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom.
If the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such claim within
thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Third Party Notice (or such
earlier date, if the failure to assume the defense on such earlier date would
materially impair the ability of such indemnified party to defend such
claim), the indemnified party against which such claim has been asserted will
(upon delivering notice to such effect to the indemnifying party) have the
right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim (all
at the cost and expense of the indemnifying party) and the indemnifying party
shall have the right to participate therein at its own cost.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no Claim may be
asserted for the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein after the expiration of the survival period as
specified in Section 9.1; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 9.2(d)
shall not limit the ability of any indemnified party to recover for any Claim
relating to the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
asserted prior to the expiration of the survival period. In addition, any
claim made by any party following the Closing with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made pursuant to
this Article IX.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Closing (i) no Acquiror
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) which arise out of any particular breach, unless
the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by all Acquiror Indemnified
Parties as a result of such breach exceeds $500,000 at which time the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for only
the aggregate amount of all such Losses in excess of $500,000 (the "
_Indemnification Basket_ ") and (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses for which
the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification shall
not exceed the Escrow Amount plus all net interest earned thereon (the "
_Indemnification Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for any
adjustments made to the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
1.4(c)(vii) and any Tax reimbursement due to Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with Section 1.9 or Section 6.3(j) without
reduction for the Indemnification Basket and up to the full amount of the
Escrow Account and the Contingent Merger Consideration.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification for all Losses resulting from any breaches of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.3, Section
2.7, Section 2.8(l), Section 2.10, Section 2.16, and Section 2.17, subject
to the Indemnification Basket, up to the full amount of the Escrow Account
and the Contingent Merger Consideration (to the extent not yet earned and
paid). For avoidance of doubt, the Contingent Merger Consideration shall be
paid when earned and once earned it shall not be subject to offset or
recoupment for any claims, adjustments, Losses or reimbursements. The
Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be required to exhaust the entire Escrow
Amount before seeking to offset against the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Closing (i) no Agencourt
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses
pursuant to Section 9.2(b) which arise out of any particular breach, unless
the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by all Agencourt Indemnified
Parties as a result of such breach exceeds the Indemnification Basket at
which time the

  

   

     
   

  



  

Agencourt Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for only
the aggregate amount of all such Losses in excess of Indemnification Basket
and (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Agencourt Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification shall not exceed the amount of
the Indemnification Cap.

  



  

(g) The parties agree that the Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement to serve as a source of payment of any
adjustments made to the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
1.4(c)(vi) or Section 1.4(c)(vii) and any Tax reimbursement due to Acquiror
or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 1.9 or Section
6.3(j), and any Claim for indemnification of any Acquiror Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article IX. The Holder Representative and Acquiror agree to
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse the proceeds of the
Escrow Amount to (x) the Acquiror Indemnified Parties to the extent that the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties are entitled to recovery with respect to the
foregoing Sections of this Agreement and any Claim for Indemnification under
this Article IX and (y) to the Holders ( _pro rata_ , in accordance with
their respective Applicable Percentages) any adjustments made to the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4(c)(vi). The parties further agree
to jointly instruct the Escrow Agent (i) to eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date to disburse to the Holders ( _pro rata_ , in accordance with
their respective Applicable Percentages) the excess, if any, of (A) fifty
percent (50%) of the balance of the Escrow Amount (as increased by the net
interest earned thereon), _less_ (B) the Retained Amount (as such term is
defined in the Escrow Agreement) and (ii) thirty-six (36) months after the
Closing Date to disburse to the Holders ( _pro rata_ , in accordance with
their respective Applicable Percentages) the remaining balance, if any, of
the Escrow Amount (as increased by the net interest earned thereon) _less_
the Retained Amount.  Thereafter, all or portions of the Retained Amount (as
increased by the net interest earned thereon) shall be disbursed to Holders (
_pro rata_ , in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages) or
the Acquiror Indemnified Parties, as applicable, in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement.  At such time as the Escrow Agent has distributed to
Acquiror from the Escrow Amount an amount equal to the Indemnification Cap,
all rights of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties to indemnification Section
9.2(a), except for Claims involving fraud.

  



  

(h) The Escrow Amount shall be increased by the amount of interest earned on
the Escrow Amount (net of any amount distributed to Acquiror for the payment
of Taxes on such interest). The Acquiror shall be responsible for reporting
and paying the applicable Taxes on the interest earned on the Escrow Amount.
At the end of each Tax year, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the
Acquiror a portion of the interest earned on the Escrow Amount in an amount
sufficient for the Acquiror to pay the applicable Taxes on the interest
earned for such Tax year.

  



  

(i) All indemnity payments made under this Agreement shall be treated for all
Tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

  



  

 **Section 9.3 Sole Remedy**. Except for Claims involving fraud, after
the Closing has occurred, the right to indemnification under this Article
IX and this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedy of each party hereto
for Losses in connection with any breach by the other party of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.

  



  

 **ARTICLE X. TERMINATION/EFFECTIVENESS**

  

 ** **

  

 **Section 10.1 Termination**. This Agreement may be terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned:

the condition specified in Section 8.2(a) would not be satisfied at the
Closing (a " _Terminating Agencourt Breach_ "), except that, if such
Terminating Agencourt Breach is curable by Agencourt through the exercise of
its commercially reasonable efforts, then, for a period of up to thirty (30)
days, but only as long as Agencourt continues to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such Terminating Agencourt Breach (the "
_Agencourt Cure Period_ "), such termination shall not be effective, and
such termination shall become effective only if the Terminating Agencourt
Breach is not cured within the Agencourt Cure Period, (ii) the Closing has
not occurred on or before June 30, 2005, (iii) any governmental
or regulatory consent or approval required as a condition to consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to Section 8.1(c) is denied by
or in a final non-appealable order or other final action issued or taken
by the appropriate Governmental Authority, (iv) the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated hereby is enjoined, prohibited or
otherwise restrained by the terms of a final, non-appealable order or
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (v) governmental or
regulatory consent or approval is conditioned by the Antitrust Authorities on
the sale, license or other disposition of assets of Acquiror or Agencourt and
Acquiror, in the exercise of their sole discretion, elects not to sell,
license or otherwise dispose of such assets.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, by written notice to Acquiror from Agencourt,
authorized by its Board of Directors, if (i) there is any material breach of

such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that
would not prevent or delay the performance by such Founder of his obligations
under this Agreement.

  



  

 **(b)** ** **The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each Founder
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by such Founder will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with, or
notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority, except where the
failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or permit, or to

  



  

2

by such Founder of his obligations under this Agreement.

 **1.** ** _Receipt of Escrow Deposit_**.

  



  

(a) _Initial Deposit_. By its signature below, the Escrow Agent acknowledges
receipt of funds from the Acquiror in an amount equal to the Escrow Amount
(such amount, as it may change from time to time, the " _Escrow Deposit_ ").

  



  

(b) _Adjustment Amount_. Pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(v) of the Merger
Agreement, if the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then Acquiror shall
pay such

  

   

     
   

  



  

Adjustment Amount, within fifteen (15) days after the Determination Date, to
the Escrow Agent to be included in the Escrow Deposit.

  



  

(c) _Uncollected Receivables_. Pursuant to Section 2.22 of the Merger
Agreement, if between after 120 days after the Closing Date and the end of
the Contingent Period the Surviving Corporation receives payment of any
Uncollected Receivables for which Acquiror received reimbursement from
the Escrow Amount, Acquiror shall pay such amount to the Escrow Agent to be
included in the Escrow Deposit and held in the Escrow Account.

  



  

(d) _Tax Accruals_. Pursuant to Section 1.9 and Section 6.3(i) of the Merger
Agreement, if the accruals for Taxes on the Closing Balance Sheet are greater
than the actual Taxes due, Acquiror shall pay the excess amount to the Escrow

 **2.** ** _Investment of Escrow Deposit_**. The Escrow Deposit shall be
invested by the Escrow Agent in a money market fund which invests solely in
United States government obligations and securities, including those

Escrow Deposit shall become part of the Escrow Deposit and held in the Escrow

 **3.** ** _Release of Escrow Deposit_**.

  



  

(a) _Escrow Adjustment Amount_. Within fifteen (15) days after the
Determination Date, Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall deliver to

") setting forth the Escrow Adjustment Amount as determined pursuant to
Section 1.4 of the Merger Agreement. If, in accordance with Section 1.4(c)(vi)
of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Adjustment Amount is a positive number,
then within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of such Joint
Written Instructions the Escrow Agent shall release to the Holders all or a
portion of the Escrow Account equal to the value of such positive Escrow
Adjustment Amount. If, in accordance with Section 1.4(c)(vii) of the Merger
Agreement, the Escrow Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then within
five (5) Business Days after the receipt of such Joint Written Instructions
the Escrow Agent shall release to the Acquiror all or a portion of the Escrow
Account equal to the value of such negative Escrow Adjustment Amount.

  



  

(b) _Uncollected Receivables_. To the extent the Agencourt Accounts
Receivables are not collected on or prior to one hundred and twenty (120)
days after the Effective Time of the Merger, Acquiror and the Holder
Representative shall deliver Joint Written Instructions to the Escrow Agent
to release to the Acquiror within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of
such Joint Written Instructions all or a portion of the Escrow Account equal
to the value of such Uncollected Receivables.

  



  

(c) _Tax Shortfalls_. To the extent the Taxes required to be paid by
Agencourt for taxable years or periods ending on before the Effective Time of
the Merger exceed the amount of Taxes accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet
and there are no Tax attributes arising before the Effective Time of the
Merger available to offset such shortfall, including but not limited to Net
Operating Loss carryovers, RandD tax credits and Tax deductions resulting from
the

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

Converted Options and Bonus Payments made within 75 days after the Effective
Time of the Merger, Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall deliver
Joint Written Instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to the Acquiror
within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of such Joint Written
Instructions all or a portion of the Escrow Account equal to the value of
such shortfall.

  



  

(d) _Indemnification Claims_. On each occasion on which the Acquiror
determines in good faith that it is entitled to payment of a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement, the Acquiror
may deliver to the Holder Representative and the Escrow Agent a written
request (a " _Draw-Down Request_ ") for the payment of such amount. The Draw-
Down Request shall set forth the amount requested and, in reasonable detail,
the specific basis for the determination that the Acquiror is entitled to the
payment of such amount.

  



  

(e) Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Holder Representative and
the Escrow Agent of a Draw-Down Request, the Holder Representative may
deliver to the Acquiror and the Escrow Agent a written objection to all or
any part of the Draw-Down Request (an " _Objection_ ").

  



  

(f) If the Holder Representative fails to deliver an Objection by the end of
the thirtieth (30th) day following the receipt by the Holder Representative
of a Draw-Down Request, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Acquiror out of the
Escrow Account an amount equal to the amount requested in the Draw-Down
Request. Any such payment shall be made on or before the fifth (5th) Business
Day following the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.  The Escrow
Agent shall continue to hold any amounts remaining in the Escrow Account
following the payment of any Draw-Down Request in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) If the Holder Representative delivers a timely Objection with respect to
all or any portion of a Draw-Down Request, the Escrow Agent shall not
disburse, and shall continue to hold in the Escrow Account, the amount
requested in the Draw-Down Request or the disputed portion thereof, as the
case may be, pending receipt of either (i) payment instructions signed by the
Acquiror and the Holder Representative, specifying the agreement of the
parties as to the action to be taken by the Escrow Agent in respect of such
Draw-Down Request (" _Payment Instructions_ ") or (ii) a notice from either
the Acquiror or the Holder Representative of a final, non-appealable order
from a court of competent jurisdiction, along with a copy of the order
(together, a " _Judgment Notice_ "), pursuant to which such court has
determined whether and to what extent the Acquiror is entitled to the amount
requested in the Draw-Down Request. Upon receipt of Payment Instructions or
a Judgment Notice, as applicable, the Escrow Agent shall thereafter act
in accordance with Section 3(h) or 3(i) below, as applicable.

  



  

(h) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of Payment Instructions, if such
Payment Instructions indicate that the Acquiror is entitled to payment in
respect of all or any portion of the Draw-Down Request, then the Escrow Agent
shall release from the Escrow Account and pay to the Acquiror the amount
indicated in such Payment Instructions. Such payment shall be made on or
before the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which such Payment
Instructions are received by the Escrow Agent. If such Payment
Instruction indicates that the Acquiror is not entitled to all or any portion
of the amount claimed in such Draw-Down Request (a " _Discharge Notice_ "),
then the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold such amount in

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement until
such amounts are to be disbursed (i) to the Acquiror pursuant to Sections
3(a), 3(b) or 3(c) or in respect of another Draw-Down Request pursuant to
Section 3(d), 3(e) or 3(f), (ii) to the Founders pursuant to Sections 3(k)
and 3(l) or (iii) to any Person pursuant to Section 3(n).

  



  

(i) If the Escrow Agent has received a Judgment Notice with respect to any
Draw-Down Request, then the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow
Account and pay to the Acquiror an amount equal to the amount due to the
Acquiror, as indicated in such Judgment Notice. Such payment will be made on
or before the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Escrow
Agent received such Judgment Notice. If such Judgment Notice indicates that
the Acquiror is not entitled to all or any portion of the amount claimed in
the Draw-Down Request (a " _Determination Discharge_ "), then the Escrow
Agent shall continue to hold the amount to which the Acquiror was determined
not to be entitled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement until such
amounts are to be disbursed (i) to the Acquiror pursuant to Sections 3(a),
3(b) or 3(c) or in respect of another Draw-Down Request pursuant to Section
3(d), 3(e) or 3(f), (ii) to the Founders pursuant to Sections 3(k) and
3(l) or (iii) to any Person pursuant to Section 3(n).

  



  

(j) As promptly as practicable following the disbursement of any funds from
the Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall send a written statement to each
of the Holder Representative and the Acquiror stating the amount of the
disbursement and the amount remaining in the Escrow Account.

  



  

(k) On the date which is eighteen (18) months after the date hereof (the "
_Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall promptly disburse to the Holders (
_pro rata_ in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages) from
the Escrow Account, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) fifty
percent (50%) of the remaining balance of the Escrow Amount over (ii) the
Retained Amount (as defined in Section 3(m)) as of the Release Date.

  



  

(l) On the date which is thirty-six months (36) months after the date hereof
(the " _Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay to the
Holders ( _pro rata_ in accordance with their respective
Applicable Percentages) from the Escrow Account, an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of (i) the remaining balance of the Escrow Account over (ii)
the Retained Amount as of the Termination Date.  Thereafter, the Escrow
Agent shall release from the Escrow Account all or portions of the Retained
Amount as and when it receives Payment Instructions, Judgment Notices,
Discharge Notices or Determination Discharges, as applicable, related to the
Outstanding Claims (as defined in Section 3(m)). Following the Termination
Date, in the event that the Retained Amount at anytime exceeds the amount of
all Outstanding Claims which have not been paid or which are not subject to a
Discharge Notice or Determination Discharge, the Escrow Agent shall pay to
the Holders ( _pro rata_ in accordance with their respective
Applicable Percentages), within five (5) Business Days of the Holder
Representatives written request for such payment, an amount equal to such
excess. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, following the
Termination Date, the Retained Amount will not be released in payment of any
claim or Draw-Down Request delivered to the Escrow Agent or the Holder
Representative after the Termination Date, and the Retained Amount will only
be disbursed (i) to the Holders ( _pro rata_  in accordance with their
respective Applicable

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

Percentages) in accordance with this Section 3(l) or Section 3(n) or (ii)
to the Acquiror in payment of an Outstanding Claim in accordance with Section
3(g), 3(h) or 3(i).

  



  

(m) In the event that the Escrow Agent shall have received on or before the
Release Date or the Termination Date, as applicable, one or more Draw-Down
Requests which have not been paid in accordance with Section 3(f) as of
the Release Date or the Termination Date, as applicable, and as to which, on
such date, the Escrow Agent has neither received and fully acted upon
Payment Instructions nor a Judgment Notice, nor received a Discharge Notice
or a Determination Discharge (any such Draw-Down Request being referred to as
an " _Outstanding Claim_ "), the Escrow Agent shall retain and continue to
hold in accordance with the terms hereof an amount equal to the amount
requested in all such Outstanding Claims (the " _Retained Amount_ ").

  



  

(n) If, at any time prior to the Termination Date, the Acquiror and the
Holder Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent Joint Written
Instructions, within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of such Joint
Written Instructions, the Escrow Agent shall release the portion of the
Escrow Account to the Person(s) specified in such Joint Written Instructions.

  



  

(o) The Holder Representative shall be responsible for providing the Escrow
Agent with all necessary information regarding the Holders, including the
names, mailing addresses and Applicable Percentages for each of the Holders.
Disbursements to the Holders may be made, at the request of the Holder
Representative, to the Exchange Agent or the Holder Representative, each of
whom will be responsible for making the disbursements to each of the Holders.

  



  

(p) Each of the Acquiror and the Holder Representative agree that it will act
in good faith to execute any Draw-Down Request, Objection, Payment
Instructions or Joint Written Instructions, as applicable, in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

Deposit with the clerk of such court in which such litigation is pending, or
to interplead all interested parties in any court of competent jurisdiction
and to deposit with the clerk of such court the Escrow Deposit.  Upon the
happening of either of the above, the Escrow Agent shall be fully relieved
and discharged of any further duties hereunder.

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

(3) If the Escrow Agent should at any time be confronted with inconsistent
claims or demands by the parties hereto, the Escrow Agent shall have the
right to interplead such parties in any state or federal court located in the
State of New York (or if such court does not have jurisdiction, any other
court of competent jurisdiction), to deposit the Escrow Deposit with the
clerk of such court, and to request that such court determine the respective
rights of the parties with respect to this Agreement, and upon doing so, the
Escrow Agent automatically shall be released from any obligations or
liability as a consequence of any claims or demands hereunder.

  



  

(b) **_Exculpation_**. Except for the Escrow Agents own willful misconduct,
bad faith or gross negligence: (i) the Escrow Agent shall have no liability

Escrow Agent under this Agreement or for any of its acts or
omissions hereunder; (ii) the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any
of the acts or omissions of the parties hereto; (iii) the Escrow Agent shall

this Agreement; and (iv) the Escrow Agent may rely and/or act upon any
written instrument, document or request believed by the Escrow Agent in good
faith to be genuine and to be executed and delivered by the proper person,
and may assume in good faith the authenticity, validity and effectiveness
thereof and shall not be obligated to make any investigation or determination
as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein.

  



  

(c) **_No Additional Duties_**. The Escrow Agent shall have no duties
except those that are expressly set forth herein, and it shall not be bound
by any notice of a claim or demand hereunder, or any waiver, modification,
amendment, termination or rescission of this Agreement, unless received by it
in writing.

  



  

(d) **_Miscellaneous_**. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers or
responsibilities hereunder and exercise any rights hereunder either directly
or by or through its agents or attorneys. The Escrow Agent shall not be
responsible for and shall not be under a duty to examine or pass upon the
validity, binding effect, execution or sufficiency of this Agreement or of
any agreement amendatory or supplemental hereto.

  



  

 **5.** ** _Indemnification of the Escrow Agent_**. In consideration of its
acceptance of the appointment as Escrow Agent, each of the Acquiror and the
Holder Representative, on behalf of the Holders, agrees to indemnify and hold
the Escrow Agent harmless for one-half of any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct by the
Escrow Agent to any person by reason of its having accepted the same or in
carrying out any of the terms hereof. Each of the Acquiror and the
Holder Representative, on behalf of the Holders, agrees to reimburse the
Escrow Agent on request for one-half of its reasonable attorneys fees and
other reasonable costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with
carrying out its duties hereunder.

  



  

 **6.** ** _Resignation of the Escrow Agent_**. The Escrow Agent, and any
successor Escrow Agent, may resign at any time as Escrow Agent hereunder by
giving at least fifteen (15) Business Days written notice to the parties.
Upon such resignation and the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, the
resigning Escrow Agent shall be absolved from any duties as Escrow Agent
hereunder. Upon their receipt of notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent,
the

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall use their reasonable best
efforts jointly to designate a successor Escrow Agent.  If the parties do
not agree upon a successor Escrow Agent within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the receipt by the parties of the Escrow Agents resignation notice,
the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Escrow Agent or other appropriate relief and any
such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all parties hereto. By
mutual agreement, the parties shall have the right at any time upon not less
than seven (7) Business Days written notice to terminate their appointment of
the Escrow Agent, or any successor Escrow Agent, as Escrow Agent hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the Escrow Agent
or any successor Escrow Agent shall continue to act as the Escrow Agent until
a successor is appointed and qualified to act as the Escrow Agent.

  



  

 **7.** ** _Taxes_**.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Agent shall timely report to the Acquiror and the Holder
Representative the aggregate amount of the income, interest, increments and
realized gains (collectively, the " _Escrow Interest_ ") on which taxes are
then due and payable (such taxes, the " _Escrow Taxes_ ") and the Acquiror
shall report the amount of such Escrow Interest to the appropriate taxing
authorities and shall pay the Escrow Taxes, in which event it may direct the
Escrow Agent, by a reasonably detailed written notice to it with a copy to
the Holder Representative, to reimburse the Acquiror in the amount of the
Escrow Taxes out of the Escrow Interest. In the event any portion of the
Escrow Amount is to be paid over to the Acquiror or to the Founders pursuant
to Section 3, such amount shall be reduced (and the amount of such reduction
shall be paid over to the Acquiror) by an amount equal to the product of (i)
the Escrow Taxes actually paid by Acquiror (to the extent not reimbursed to
it pursuant to the preceding sentence) _multiplied_   _by_ (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount otherwise to be paid to the Acquiror or
to the Holders under this sentence and the denominator of which is the Escrow
Amount.  The amount determined pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
be adjusted to the extent reasonably practical to account for any duplication
in payment and any timing differences in payments into and disbursements from
the Escrow Account.

  



  

(b) For each disbursement from the Escrow Account payable to the Holders, the
Holder Representative shall provide the Escrow Agent with the applicable
amount of taxes to be withheld from each Holders share of the disbursement.
The Escrow Agent shall withhold such amounts and remit the aggregate amount
of such withholding taxes to Agencourt pursuant to the instructions provided
by the Holder Representative.

  



  

(c) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Acquiror and
Holder Representative shall provide the Escrow Agent with a fully executed
W-8 or W-9 Internal Revenue Service form and the correct
Taxpayer Identification Number (" _TIN_ ") assigned by the Internal Revenue
Service or any other taxing authority for the Acquiror and each of the
Holders.

  



  

 **8.** ** _Notices_**. All notices and other communications required or
permitted pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and be deemed
to have been duly given when delivered personally (which shall include
delivery by Federal Express or other nationally recognized, reputable
overnight courier service that issues a receipt or other confirmation of

securities nor any transfer agent of such securities shall give any effect to
such attempted Transfer in its stock records.

except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act and the Delaware Securities Act, as amended, (ii) upon receipt

satisfactory to the Corporation, or (iii) upon receipt of a no-action letter
from the Securities and Exchange Commission addressed to the Corporation and
reasonably satisfactory

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

to the Board, to the effect that no registration statement is required
because of the availability of an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act.

  



  

4. _Transfers to Permitted Transferees_.  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, a Stockholder may Transfer all or any of the Subject Shares to a Permitted Transferee who is an "accredited investor" under Regulation D of the Securities Act and agrees in writing to be bound by this Agreement. In the event a Stockholder (the " _Transferring Stockholder_ ") shall Transfer any or all of the Subject Shares to any Permitted Transferee, and in the further event that the Transferring Stockholder shall be required (or otherwise would have been required) to Transfer all or any of such Subject Shares to the Corporation pursuant to any provision hereof, then such person or entity to whom the Subject Shares have been transferred shall be required to Transfer all of such Subject Shares to the Corporation at such time and upon the same terms and conditions as are (or otherwise would have been) applicable to the Transferring Stockholder. As a condition to any Transfer of Subject Shares, each Permitted Transferee shall sign and deliver an Accredited Investor Questionnaire and a Joinder Agreement to the Corporation.

  



  

5. _Right of First Refusal_.  If a Stockholder (the " _Offering Stockholder_ ") receives a bona fide offer to purchase, for cash or a promise to pay cash in installments, any or all of the Subject Shares and the Offering Stockholder desires to sell any or all of the Subject Shares to the person or entity making the bona fide offer, the Offering Stockholder shall first offer to sell such Subject Shares (the " _Offered Shares_ ") to the existing Stockholders of the Corporation. The Offering Stockholder shall make a written offer (the " _Notice of Option_ ") to each Stockholder setting forth the price and other terms of the intended Transfer, which shall be the same price and terms as contained in the bona fide offer, and shall be delivered by the Offering Stockholder by certified or registered mail. Each such Stockholder shall have the right, for a period of fifteen (15) days after the delivery of said Notice of Option, to elect to purchase any of the Offered Shares at the price and upon the terms set forth in the Notice of Option. If any Stockholder desires to exercise such right within said fifteen (15)-day period, such Stockholder shall give written notice of that fact to the Offering Stockholder and the Corporation. Each Stockholder may purchase any or all of the Offered Shares, up to its Proportionate Percentage. If the Stockholders do not elect to purchase all of the Offered Shares, the Offering Stockholder shall be free for a period of thirty (30) days to Transfer the remaining unsold Offered Shares to the bona fide purchaser but not at a lower price or on more favorable terms than the price and terms stated in the Notice of Option. Any of the Offered Shares not sold to such purchaser within said thirty (30)-day period shall again be subject to the rights of first refusal set forth in this _Section 4_.

  



  

6. _Tag-Along Right_.  Subject to the terms and conditions specified in this _Section 6_, in the event that any Stockholder owning in the aggregate at least ten percent (10%) of the outstanding Securities (a " _Significant Stockholder_ ") proposes to Transfer ten percent (10%) or more of the Subject Shares then owned by such Significant Stockholder (other than to the Corporation or a Permitted Transferee of such Significant Stockholder), such Significant Stockholder hereby grants to each Stockholder a tag-along right with respect to such Transfers of Subject Shares by the Significant Stockholder. Each time a Significant Stockholder proposes to Transfer any Subject Shares pursuant to this _Section 6_, the Significant Stockholder shall comply with the following provisions:

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

(a) The Significant Stockholder shall deliver a written notice (" _Tag-Along
Notice_ ") to the other Stockholders stating (i) his bona fide intention to
Transfer such Subject Shares, (ii) the proposed purchaser of the Subject
Shares, (iii) the number of such Subject Shares to be sold, and (iv) the
price and terms, if any, upon which he proposes to sell such Subject Shares.
By written notification received by the Significant Stockholder within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Tag-Along Notice, each Stockholder may
elect to sell, at the price and on the terms specified in the Tag-Along
Notice, up to that portion of such Subject Shares which equals the proportion
that the number of Securities of the Corporation issued and held by such
Stockholder bears to the total number of Securities, on a Common Share
Equivalent Basis, of the Corporation then outstanding as of the date of the
Tag-Along Notice. The Significant Stockholder shall not consummate any
Transfer of Subject Shares to which this _Section 6_ is applicable unless
the purchasers simultaneously purchase all of the Securities that the
Stockholders have elected to sell pursuant to this _Section 6(a)_.

  



  

(b) If the Stockholders do not elect to exercise their rights to sell Subject
Shares in any transaction specified in the Tag-Along Notice as provided in
_Section 6(a) _hereof, the Significant Stockholder may, during the thirty
(30)-day period following the delivery of the Tag-Along Notice, sell the
Subject Shares proposed to be sold pursuant to the Tag-Along Notice upon the
terms specified in the Tag-Along Notice. Any of the Subject Shares proposed to
be sold pursuant to the Tag-Along Notice which have not been sold within said
thirty (30)-day period shall again be subject to the tag-along right set
forth in this  _Section 6_.

  



  

7. _Right of First Offer_.  Subject to the terms and conditions specified in this _Section 7_, the Corporation hereby grants to each Stockholder a right of first offer with respect to future sales of Securities by the Corporation. Each time the Corporation proposes to offer any Securities (" _New Shares_ "), the Corporation shall first make an offering of such New Shares to each Stockholder in accordance with the following provisions:

  



  

(a) The Corporation shall deliver a written notice (" _Offer Notice_ ") to
the Stockholders stating (i) its bona fide intention to offer such New
Shares, (ii) the number of such New Shares to be offered, and (iii) the price
and terms, if any, upon which it proposes to offer such New Shares.

  



  

(b) By written notification received by the Corporation within fifteen (15)
days after receipt of the Offer Notice, the Stockholder may elect to purchase
or obtain, at the price and on the terms specified in the Offer Notice, up to
that portion of such New Shares which equals the proportion that the number
of Securities issued and held by such Stockholder bears to the total number
of Securities, on a Common Stock Equivalent Basis, of the Corporation then
outstanding as of the date of the Offer Notice.

  



  

(c) If all New Shares referred to in the Offer Notice are not elected to be
obtained as provided in _Section 7(b) _hereof, the Corporation may, during
the sixty (60)-day period following the delivery of the Offer Notice, offer
the remaining unsubscribed portion of such New Shares to any Person or
Persons at a price not less than, and upon terms no more favorable to the
offeree than those specified in the Offer Notice. If the Corporation does not
enter into an agreement for the sale of the New Shares within such period, or
if such agreement is not consummated within sixty (60) days of the execution
thereof, the right provided hereunder

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

shall be deemed to be revived and such New Shares shall not be offered unless
first reoffered to the Stockholders in accordance herewith. Any of the New
Shares which have been offered to the Corporation and which have not been
sold within said sixty (60)-day period shall again be subject to the right of
first offer set forth in this _Section 7_.

  



  

(d) The right of first offer in this _Section 7_ shall not be applicable (i)
to the issuance of shares of Common Stock (or Securities convertible into
Common Stock) not to exceed 1,000,000 shares in the aggregate to employees,
consultants or directors of the Corporation pursuant to the 2005 Plan (as
amended from time to time); (ii) to or after consummation of a Qualified
Public Offering; (iii) to the issuance of Securities pursuant to the
conversion or exercise of convertible or exercisable Securities outstanding
on the date of this Agreement or issued after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with this _Section 7_; (iv) to the issuance of Securities
pursuant to reclassifications, stock splits, stock dividends or like
transactions; (v) to the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion of
Preferred Stock; (vi) to the issuance of Securities in connection with a bona
fide business acquisition by the Corporation, whether by merger,
consolidation, purchase of assets, exchange of stock or otherwise; (vii)
to the issuance of Securities to Persons with which the Corporation has or
is entering into business relationships (including customers, vendors
and lenders), or (viii) to the issuance of Securities to a Strategic Partner;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the exceptions set forth in clauses (vii) and
(viii) shall be limited to issuances of Securities that do not exceed 2% in
any one instance, and 10% in the aggregate, of the total issued and
outstanding Securities determined, in each instance, at the time of such
issuance and taking in account such issuance.

  



  

8. _Drag-Along Rights_.  Subject to the right of first refusal in _Section 5_, if the Founders desire to effect a sale of the Corporation, the Founders shall notify the other Stockholders, in writing, of such desire and the terms and conditions of such proposed sale. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Stockholder will take all necessary and desirable actions in connection with the consummation of such sale of the Corporation, and if such transaction is structured as a sale of Securities, within ten (10) business days of the receipt of such notice (or such longer period of time as the Founders shall designate in such notice) the Stockholders shall cause all their respective Securities to be sold to the designated purchaser on the same terms and conditions and for the same per share consideration as the Securities being sold by the Founders. In furtherance of, and not in limitation of the foregoing, in connection with a sale of the Corporation, each Stockholder will consent to the sale of the Corporation and execute all documents containing such terms and conditions as those executed by other Stockholders, as directed by the Founders, as the case may be. The Corporation will bear the costs and expenses incurred in connection with a sale of the Corporation. The Corporation will not share costs incurred by any Stockholder on its own behalf.

  



  

9. _Market Stand-Still Agreement_.  Each Stockholder hereby agrees that during the 180-day period following the effective date of a registration statement of the Corporation filed under the Securities Act, it shall not, to the extent requested by the Corporation and its underwriter, sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of (other than to a Person who agrees to be similarly bound) any Registrable Securities of the Corporation held by it at any time during such period except Securities included in such registration.  To enforce the foregoing covenant, (i) the Stockholders agree to execute a written agreement to this effect if requested by the Corporation,

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

and (ii) the Corporation may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect
to the Registrable Securities of the Stockholders (and the shares or
securities of every other Person subject to the foregoing restriction) until
the end of such period.

  



  

10. _Piggy-Back Registrations_.

  



  

(a) If the Corporation proposes to register any Securities under the
Securities Act (other than by a registration on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any
successor or similar forms or in connection with an employee stock ownership
plan, employee stock purchase plan or similar plan designed to facilitate
employee ownership of the Corporation) whether for its own account or for the
account of any other Person, the Corporation will, each such time, give
prompt written notice to the Stockholders of its intention to do so and of
the Stockholders rights under this _Section 10_.  Except as provided in the
next sentence, upon written request of the Stockholders made within twenty
(20) days after the receipt of any such notice, which request shall specify
the Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by the Stockholders,
the Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the
registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the
Corporation has been so requested to register by the Stockholders, to the
extent requisite to permit the disposition of the Registrable Securities
to be registered, by inclusion of such Registrable Securities in the
registration statement which covers the securities which the Corporation
proposes to register. If, at any time after giving written notice of its
intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the
registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the
Corporation shall determine for any reason either not to register or to delay
registration of such Securities, the Corporation may, at its election, give
written notice of such determination to the Stockholders and, thereupon, (i)
in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its
obligation to register any of the Stockholders Registrable Securities in
connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay all
expenses in connection therewith) and (ii) in the case of a determination to
delay registration, shall be permitted to delay registering any Registrable
Securities, for the same period as the delay in registering such other
securities. The Corporation will pay all Registration Expenses in connection
with each registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this _Section
10_. The Corporation shall have no obligation to include Registrable
Securities in a registration statement of the Corporation filed on Form S-1
with respect to an initial public offering of the Corporations Securities.

  



  

(b) If the Corporation at any time proposes to register any Securities under
the Securities Act as contemplated by _Section 10_, and such Securities are
to be distributed by or through one or more underwriters, the Corporation
will, if requested by the Stockholders as provided in _Section 10_, use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange for such underwriters to include all
Registrable Securities to be offered and sold by the Stockholders among the
securities to be distributed by such underwriters; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Corporation shall have no such obligation unless the Stockholder
accepts the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon by the Corporation and
the underwriters selected by it; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
managing underwriter of such underwritten offering shall inform the
Corporation and the Stockholders by written notice of its opinion that
inclusion in such distribution of all or a specified number of such
securities proposed to be distributed by such underwriters would
interfere with the successful marketing of the securities being distributed
by such underwriters (such letter to state

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

the basis of such belief and the approximate number of such Registrable
Securities proposed so to be registered which may be distributed without such
effect), then the Corporation may, upon written notice to the Stockholders,
reduce (if and to the extent stated by such managing underwriter to be
necessary to eliminate such effect), the number of Registrable Securities of
the Stockholders (other than the Corporation) proposed to be included so that
the resultant aggregate number of such Registrable Securities so included in
such registration, together with the number of Securities to be included in
the registration for the account of the Corporation, shall be equal to the
number of shares stated in such managing underwriters letter. Any cutback in
the number of Registrable Securities of the Stockholders (other than
the Corporation) shall be made on a pro rata basis determined by dividing
the number of Registrable Securities each such Stockholder elected to be
included in such registration by the aggregate number of Registrable
Securities all such Stockholders elected to be included in such registration.

  



  

(c) The rights granted pursuant to this _Section 10_ shall terminate upon
the earliest of (i) 2 years from a Qualified Initial Public Offering, or (ii)
such time as the Stockholders can Transfer their Subject Shares pursuant to
Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act.

  



  

11. _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) The Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, and hereby does
indemnify and hold harmless, each holder of Registrable Securities, its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors and partners and each
Person who controls such holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act)
against, and pay and reimburse such holder, affiliate, director, officer or
partner or controlling Person for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
joint or several, to which such holder or any such affiliate, director,
officer or partner or controlling Person may become subject under the
Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
or (iii) any violation by the Corporation of any rule or regulation
promulgated under the Securities Act or any state securities laws applicable
to the Corporation and relating to action or inaction required of the
Corporation in connection with any such registration, and the
Corporation shall pay and reimburse such holder and each such affiliate,
director, officer, partner and controlling Person for any legal or any other
expenses actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating, defending or settling any such loss, claim, liability, action
or proceeding, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Corporation shall not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage,
liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out
of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or
omission or alleged omission, made in such registration statement, any such
prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,
or in any application, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written
information prepared and furnished to the Corporation by such holder of
Registrable Securities expressly for use therein or by such holders failure
to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto after the Corporation has furnished such
holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same. In

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

connection with an underwritten offering, the Corporation, if requested,
shall indemnify such underwriters, their officers and directors and each
Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification
of the holders of Registrable Securities.

  



  

(b) In connection with any registration statement in which a holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, each such holder shall furnish to
the Corporation in writing such information and affidavits as the Corporation
reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration
statement or prospectus and, shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Corporation, its directors and officers, each underwriter and each other
Person who controls the Corporation (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) and each such underwriter against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, joint or several, to which such holder of Registrable
Securities or any such director or officer, any such underwriter or
controlling Person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material
fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary
prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or in any
application or (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is
made in such registration statement, any such prospectus or preliminary
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information prepared and
furnished to the Corporation by such holder of Registrable Securities
expressly for use therein, and such holder shall reimburse the Company and
each such director, officer, underwriter and controlling Person for any legal
or any other expenses actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection
with investigating, defending or settling any such loss, claim, liability,
action or proceeding, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the obligation to
indemnify and hold harmless will be individual and several to each holder and
will be limited to the net amount of proceeds received by such holder from
the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement.

  



  

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification and (ii) unless in such indemnified partys
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is
not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim,
unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict
of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of
such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

(d) The indemnification provided for under this _Section 11_ will remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the registration and sale of any
Securities by any Person entitled to any indemnification hereunder and the
expiration or termination of this Agreement. The Corporation also agrees to
make such provisions, as are reasonably requested by any indemnified
party, for contribution to such party in the event the Corporations
indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on
indemnification contained in the underwriting agreements entered into among
the selling holders of Registrable Securities, the Corporation and the
underwriters in connection with the underwritten public offering are in
conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting
agreement shall be controlling as to the Registrable Securities included in
the public offering, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if, as a result of this
_Section 11(e)_, any holder of Registrable Securities, its officers,
directors, and partners and any Person controlling such holder is held liable
for an amount which exceeds the aggregate proceeds received by such holder
from the sale of Registrable Securities included in a registration, as
provided in _Section 11(b) _above, pursuant to such underwriting agreement
(the " _Excess Liability_ "), the Corporation shall reimburse any such holder
for such Excess Liability.

  



  

12. _Expiration of Provisions_.  Except for _Sections 9, 10 and 11_ _,_  this Agreement shall expire upon a Qualified Public Offering, so that the restrictions imposed and rights granted hereunder shall not apply to dispositions of the Subject Shares.

  



  

13. _Certificate Legend_.  All certificates representing Subject Shares, for so long as they are subject hereto, shall have endorsed upon them a legend evidencing the restrictions set forth herein in substantially the following form:

  



  

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE
RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN A STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT DATED AS OF APRIL 22, 2005
AMONG THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN HOLDERS OF ITS CAPITAL STOCK, AS MAY
BE AMENDED, MODIFIED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME (A COPY OF WHICH IS ON
FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE CORPORATION).

  



  

14. _Specific Performance_.  In recognition of the immeasurable, irreparable harm that a violation of any of this Agreement would cause the Corporation, each Stockholder agrees that in addition to any other relief afforded by law, a temporary and permanent injunction against any and all violations may be immediately issued against the Stockholder and every other person concerned thereby, it being their understanding that both damages and an injunction shall be proper relief and are not to be considered alternative remedies.

  



  

15. _Delivery of Stock and Documents_.  Upon the closing of any purchase of any of the Subject Shares pursuant to this Agreement, the seller shall deliver to the purchaser the following: the certificate or certificates representing the Subject Shares being sold, duly endorsed for transfer and bearing such documentary stamps, if any, as are necessary, and such assignments,

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

certificates of authority, tax releases, consents to transfer, instruments,
and evidences of title of the seller and of his compliance with this
Agreement as may be reasonably required by the purchaser or by counsel for
the purchaser.

  



  

16. _Remedy for Failure to Transfer Shares_.  In the event that a Stockholder shall be required to sell any of the Subject Shares pursuant to any provision hereof, and in the further event that the Stockholder is unable to, or for any reason does not, deliver the certificate or certificates evidencing the Subject Shares to the person who, or entity which, is or desires to purchase the Subject Shares, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, the purchaser of the Subject Shares may deposit the purchase price for the Subject Shares, by good check, promissory note or both, as the case may be under the applicable provisions hereof, with any bank doing business within fifty (50) miles of the principal office of the Corporation, or with the Corporations certified public accountants, as agent or trustee, or in escrow, for the Stockholder who was required to sell (the " _Seller Stockholder_ "), to be held by the bank or accountant until withdrawn by the Stockholder.  Upon the deposit by the purchaser of the purchase price for the Subject Shares and upon notice to the Seller Stockholder, the Subject Shares to be sold pursuant to the applicable provisions of this Agreement shall at such time be deemed to have been sold, assigned, transferred, and conveyed to the purchaser, the Seller Stockholder shall have no further rights thereto, and the Corporation shall record the transfer in its stock transfer book.

  



  

17. _Provisions Binding Upon Transferees_.  In the event that, at any time or from time to time, any of the Subject Shares are transferred to any party, other than the Corporation, pursuant to any provision hereof, the transferee shall take such Subject Shares pursuant to all terms, conditions, and covenants of this Agreement as then in effect, and, as a condition precedent to the Transfer of such Subject Shares, the transferee shall agree, for and on behalf of himself or itself, his, her or its legal representatives, and his, her or its transferees and assigns, in writing to be bound by all provisions hereof.

  



  

18. _Amendments_. Any amendment to this Agreement or waiver of any provision hereof shall require the written consent of (i) holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Subject Shares and (ii) the Founders.

  



  

19. _Governing Law_.  The provisions hereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.

  



  

20. _Notices_.  Any and all notices, designations, consents, offers, acceptances or any other communication provided for herein shall be given in writing by registered or certified mail which shall be addressed, in the case of the Corporation, to its principal office, and in the case of any Stockholder, to his residence or other address on file with the Corporation.

  



  

21. _Further Assurances_.  The Stockholder shall execute and deliver any and all necessary documents or instruments and take all other action necessary or appropriate to carry out and effectuate the provisions hereof.

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

22. _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile, telecopy or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar instantaneous electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes as of the date first written above. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile, telecopy or other reproduction hereof.

# **FORM OF NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT**

  

# ** **

  

This NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT, dated as of  (this "
_Agreement_ "), is entered into among BECKMAN COULTER, INC., a Delaware
corporation (" _Beckman_ "), AGENCOURT BIOSCIENCE CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (" _Agencourt_ ") and , an
individual (" _Covenantor_ "), and is ancillary to that certain Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of April 22, 2005 (the " _Merger Agreement_
"), among Beckman, Agencourt and BCI New Co, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_MergerSub_ "), which provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger
Sub with and into Agencourt, with Agencourt being the surviving corporation.
Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

# **RECITALS**

  

# ** **

  

WHEREAS, Covenantor owned beneficially and of record approximately 
% (the " _Covenantor Interests_ ") of the issued and outstanding Common
Stock of Agencourt (the " _Common Shares_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Beckman acquired 100% of the
issued and outstanding Common Shares;

  



  

WHEREAS, Covenantor has benefited from the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement through his former ownership of the Covenantor Interests;
and

  



  

WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Covenantor are
conditions to the obligations of Beckman to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and Beckman would not
consummate such transactions without the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Non-Competition_. Covenantor agrees that, for the period from the date hereof through  [fifth anniversary] (the " _Covenant Period_ "), Covenantor shall not directly or indirectly become employed by, become a director, officer, stockholder, equity owner, or partner of, or otherwise enter into, conduct, or advise (any of the foregoing, " _participate in_ "), directly or indirectly, any business or endeavour, other than Agencourt or Newco, that is engaged in the Sequencing Business (as defined below).  Covenantor shall not be in violation of this Agreement solely by reason of investing in stock, bonds or other securities of any company engaged in the Sequencing Business (but without otherwise participating in such company), if (i) such stock, bonds or other securities are listed on any national securities exchange or have been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and (ii) such investment by Covenantor does not exceed, in the case of any class of the capital stock of any one issuer, five percent (5%) of the issued and outstanding shares of such capital stock or, in the case of bonds or other securities, one percent (5%) of the aggregate

  

   

     
   

  



  

principal amount thereof issued and outstanding. " _Sequencing Business_ "
means the services and reagent business conducted by Agencourt on the Closing
Date of the Merger Agreement, but for purposes of this noncompetition
convenant specifically does not include the business of Newco; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that so long as Covenantor is employed by Agencourt, he
shall spend a majority of his time on Agencourts business.

  



  

2. _Nonsolicitation_. Covenantor agrees that, during the Covenant Period, Covenantor shall not (without the prior written consent of Beckman) cause or induce, or attempt to cause or induce, any employee of Agencourt to terminate his or her employment with Agencourt.  This nonsolicitation covenant shall not apply to the solicitation of Polony Employees in compliance with Section 6.3(f) of the Merger Agreement.

  



  

3. _Necessity for Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation_.  In connection with this Agreement, Beckman and Covenantor each acknowledge and agree that the following statements are true, and are the basis upon which this Agreement has been made:

  



  

(a) This Agreement is entered into as a part of the Merger Agreement, each of
the covenants set forth in this Agreement is an essential element of the
Merger Agreement and, but for the agreement of Covenantor to comply with
these covenants, Beckman would not have entered into the Merger Agreement.

  



  

(b) Covenantor has independently consulted with his counsel and after such
consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in this Agreement are
reasonable and proper.

  



  

(c) Covenantor has had access to confidential and proprietary information
about Agencourt, its business, operations and strategy (the " _Agencourt
Information_ "). The Agencourt Information is a substantial and important
part of the value of Agencourt, and an important basis on which the terms of
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been determined.
Because of the fact that Beckman is paying substantial consideration for the
value and benefit of the Agencourt Information, competition by Covenantor
with Agencourt in the Sequencing Business would not be fair, and this
Agreement is a method to prevent such unfair competition from Covenantor. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the restraints contained in this Agreement
are necessary to protect such value and benefit.

  



  

(d) This Agreement, and compliance with it, will not cause any particular
hardship on Covenantor.

  



  

(e) In view of the substantial value being paid by Beckman to the Covenantor
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that the time during
which this Agreement will remain in effect is reasonable.  The parties
acknowledge that it will take the duration of the Covenant Period for
Covenantors knowledge of the Agencourt Information and Covenantors ability
to influence the relationships of the business of the Company or Beckman or
its Affiliates to diminish to the point where competition from Covenantor
would be reasonable and fair.

4. _Injunctive Relief_. Covenantor acknowledges that any breach or violation of the terms of this Agreement will cause irreparable harm, damage and injury to Beckman and its Affiliates. Because of the importance of the business of the Company, which this Agreement attempts to protect, and the inability to determine the extent that such business may be damaged in the event of a breach of this Agreement or the dollar amount of such damage, Beckman and Covenantor each acknowledge and agree that Beckman could not be adequately compensated for breach of this Agreement by an award of damages, but that equitable relief in the form of a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent injunction, including a mandatory injunction, or other equitable relief, is necessary in order to insure that Beckman receives the benefit of the bargain represented by this Agreement, and the Merger Agreement to which this Agreement is ancillary. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that in addition to, and without limitation upon, any right or remedy which Beckman may have at law, Beckman and its Affiliates shall have the right to specifically enforce performance of this Agreement by equitable or injunctive means.

  



  

5. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable and separable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any part of this Agreement shall not invalidate any other part of this Agreement. Further, if any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall automatically be modified to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

  



  

6. _Enforceability_. It is the desired intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permissible in each jurisdiction in which such enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any portion of the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, arbitrary, against public policy or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such restrictive covenants shall be considered divisible both as to time and as to geographical area, and each month of the Covenant Period shall be deemed a separate period of time, and each country, state, county, city, parish or other local jurisdiction shall be deemed a separate geographical area, so that the court may reduce the scope thereof or otherwise amend or reform the portion thus adjudicated to a lesser period of time or a smaller geographical area that is determined to be reasonable, not arbitrary, not against public policy and valid and enforceable by Beckman, such amendment or reformation to apply only with respect to the operation of this Agreement in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made.

  



  

7. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal law of the State of New York, without regard to the principles of the conflict of laws thereof.

  



  

8. _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein. This Agreement replaces and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, statements, memoranda and understandings, whether oral or written, by and among the parties of any of them. Any proposed modification, alteration, or addendum to this Agreement shall be deemed valid only when reduced to writing and executed by the party sought to be bound thereby.

9. _Headings_. The article and section headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

10. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

11. _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal and legal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns. No party may assign this Agreement or any of such partys rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_  that Beckman may assign this Agreement or its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates.

  



  

12. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) upon actual receipt, when delivered by hand, (ii) upon receipt of transmission confirmation, when sent by facsimile, (iii) three days after mailing by registered or certified mail within the United States, (iv) one day after sending by overnight courier (with postage prepaid and confirmation requested) within the Unites States and (v) two days after sending by international courier (with postage prepaid and confirmation requested).
