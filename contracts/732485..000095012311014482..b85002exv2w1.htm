filed with the SEC. In particular, the Merger Agreement is not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosure
regarding any facts and circumstances relating to Genzyme. The Merger Agreement includes representations, warranties and covenants
of Genzyme, Sanofi-Aventis and GC Merger Corp. made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement. The assertions
embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the contract among Genzyme, Sanofi-Aventis and GC
Merger Corp. and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by Genzyme, Sanofi-Aventis and GC Merger Corp.
in connection with the negotiated terms. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as
of any specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to
Genzyme&#146;s SEC filings or may have been used for purposes of allocating risk among Genzyme, Sanofi-Aventis and GC Merger Corp. rather
than establishing matters as facts. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any description
thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts of Genzyme, Sanofi-Aventis and GC Merger Corp. or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates.
