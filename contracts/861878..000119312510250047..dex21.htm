regard:

(A) in the case of a tax for a Straddle Period that is based on or related to
income or receipts or is imposed in connection with the sale of goods or
services (e.g., state sales tax or use tax), the Reimbursable Portion of the
tax shall be equal to the amount that would have been payable if the Straddle
Period had ended on (and included) the Closing Date; and

 



30 (B) in the case of a tax for a Straddle Period that is imposed in respect of
the assets of Target or is otherwise measured by the value or level of any
item, the Reimbursable Portion of the tax shall be equal to the product of the
tax multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period.

 

(iv) Buyer and Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Shareholder
Representative to enable him to cause to be prepared all tax returns that he
is required to cause to be prepared pursuant to §5(k)(i); and in this regard,
Buyer and Surviving Corporation shall retain and make available to the
Shareholder Representative all of Targets books and records that the
Shareholder Representative reasonably requires and cause Surviving Corporation
to sign all tax returns that the Shareholder Representative causes to be
prepared. Buyer shall have the right to review and approve (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) each such tax
return and at least 10 business days in which to comment on it before it is
filed.

(v) The Shareholder Representative shall have the right to review and approve
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
each tax return for a Straddle Period that Buyer or Surviving Corporation is
required to file pursuant to §5(k)(iii) and at least 10 Business Days in which
to comment on it before it is filed.

(l) _Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans_. Following Closing for a period
ending on the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall
cause Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain substantially intact the work force of Target and its Subsidiaries as
that work force exists on the date of this Agreement. In this regard, Buyer
shall cause Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to continue the base
salaries or hourly rates of the employees of Target and its Subsidiaries as of
the date of this Agreement and to continue to provide the same benefits to
them that Target provided or, in Buyers discretion, provide them with the
same benefits that Buyer provides to its similarly-situated employees. To the
maximum extent permitted by law, for the purposes of any of Buyers benefit
plans for which eligibility or vesting of benefits depends on length of
service, and for any benefit for which the amount or level of benefits
depends on length of service, Buyer shall give (or cause to be given) to each
employee of Target or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date full credit for
past service with Target and/or its Subsidiaries as of and through the
Closing Date (" _Prior Service_ "). In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each such employee (a) shall be given credit for
Prior Service for purposes of eligibility to participate, satisfaction of any
waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of
any pre-existing condition limitations, (b) shall be given credit for amounts
paid under a corresponding Target plan during the same

 



31  period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Buyers plan and (c) shall be eligible to receive such periods
of vacation leave, sick leave, personal days, holidays and other similar
periods of leave as were accrued and available to the employee under Targets
plans immediately prior to the Closing. 

(m) _Rehrig Healthcare Systems_. Prior to Closing (i) Target shall obtain the
agreement of Rehrig Pacific Company, Inc. to the dissolution of Rehrig
Healthcare Systems LLC and (ii) it shall be dissolved and all obligations of
the members under its limited liability company agreement, as it may have been
amended or supplemented, addenda, shall be terminated. Target shall pay any
amounts that may be required to be paid to Rehrig Pacific Company, Inc. in
this regard ( _"LLC Dissolution Payments_ "), subject to a credit by Buyer,
not exceeding $100,000, for the amount that Target is required to pay for the
unamortized cost of the 31- and 43-gallon reusable medical waste container
molds incurred by Rehrig Pacific Company, Inc.

(n) _Matthews Incinerator_.

(i) Without violating any provision of this Agreement, Target may sell or
cause the sale to a third party, conditional upon and concurrent with Closing,
of the incinerator in Matthews, North Carolina owned and operated by Targets
Subsidiary, BMWNC, Inc., a North Carolina corporation, together with the
associated permits for the incinerator, for a price and on such terms and
subject to such conditions as Target, in its sole discretion, approves, with
the exception that the terms of sale (i) shall not include any customer
contracts or impose any post-closing burden or obligation on the seller other
than to cooperate, at no more than a nominal cost, in the transfer of any
permit to the buyer and (ii) shall require the buyer to assume the obligation
to install monitoring wells and perform the annual sampling for one well as
described in §3(t) (third paragraph) of the Disclosure Schedule. Target may
distribute all of the net proceeds of sale to the Stockholders.

 

(ii) If Target declines or fails to sell or cause the sale of the incinerator
prior to the Closing Date, Target shall cause BMWNC, Inc. immediately prior
to Closing (i) to transfer the incinerator and associated permits (but not any
customer contracts) to a new corporation or limited liability company, subject
to the new entitys assumption of the obligation to install monitoring wells
and perform the annual sampling for one well as described in §3(t) (third
paragraph) of the Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) to distribute the stock or
membership interests in the new entity to Targets Shareholders (by reason of
which the new entity will not be a Subsidiary of Target as of Closing and
Buyer will acquire no interest in the new entity).

 

(iii) Subject to the renewal of any required permits (which Target and BMWNC,
Inc. shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), pending closing of
the sale of the incinerator or distribution of the incinerator to the new
entity, Target shall cause BMWNC, Inc. to continue to maintain and operate the
incinerator in the Ordinary Course of Business.

§8\. Survival; Indemnification; Shareholder Representative.

 

(a) _Survival of Representations and Warranties._

 

(i) The representations and warranties of Target and Buyer, Transitory
Subsidiary and Surviving Corporation, respectively, contained in this
Agreement, or in any certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, shall survive Closing until March 31, 2012 (the expiration of
such period, the " _Survival Date_ "), _provided, however_ , that (i) if, at
any time prior to the close of business on the Survival Date, an Officers
Certificate (as defined in §8(g) hereof) is delivered alleging Losses and a
claim for recovery under §8(b) hereof, then the claim asserted in such notice
shall survive the Survival Date until such claim is fully and finally
resolved.

 

(ii) The covenants of Target and Buyer, Transitory Subsidiary and Surviving
Corporation, respectively set forth in §2 and §5 hereof shall survive the
Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

(b)  _Indemnification._

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Stockholders
and the In the Money Optionholders agree to indemnify and hold Buyer,
Transitory Subsidiary and Surviving Corporation and their respective officers,
directors, and affiliates (each a " _Buyer Indemnified Party"_ and,
collectively _, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"_ ), harmless against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs, and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of investigation and
defense, but excluding punitive, special, exemplary or consequential damages,
lost profits, incidental damages, indirect damages, unrealized expectations,
damages based on any type of multiple, diminution in value or other similar
items (hereinafter individually a " _Loss_ " and collectively " _Losses_ ")
incurred or sustained by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or any of them,
directly or indirectly, as a result of (A) any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty of the Target contained in this Agreement or in
any certificate or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Target
pursuant to this Agreement and (B) any failure by the Target to perform or
comply with any covenant applicable to it contained in this Agreement.

 



36 (ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer, Transitory
Subsidiary, and Surviving Corporation agree to indemnify and hold the
Stockholders, the In the Money Optionholders, and their respective officers,
directors, and affiliates (each a " _Seller Indemnified Party"_ and,
collectively, the _"Seller Indemnified Parties"_ ), harmless against all
Losses incurred or sustained by the Seller Indemnified Parties, or any of
them, directly or indirectly, as a result of (A) any breach or inaccuracy of
a representation or warranty of Buyer and/or Transitory Subsidiary in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered by or on behalf
of the Buyer and/or Transitory Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement, and (B)
any failure by Buyer and/or Transitory Subsidiary to perform or comply with
any covenant applicable to it contained in this Agreement.

(c) _Net._ For all purposes of §8(b), any Loss of any Indemnified Party shall
be net of (i) any insurance or other recoveries actually received by the
Indemnified Party or its affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise
to the right of indemnification (after accounting for reasonable costs
incurred to collect such insurance recoveries); and (ii) any tax benefits
actually recognized by the Indemnified Party in the year of the indemnity
claim and resulting from the incurrence or payment of such Loss.

(d) _Escrow Fund._ As provided in §2(c)(iv)(F), at Closing Buyer shall cause
Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Escrow Agent each Stockholders and
each In the Money Optionholders Pro Rata Escrow Portion in cash. The cash to
be deposited in the Escrow Fund shall constitute an escrow fund (the "
_Escrow Fund_ ") to be governed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The
Pro Rata Escrow Portion of each Stockholder and In the Money Optionholder
shall be as set forth on a schedule delivered by the Target to the Escrow
Agent at Closing in a form previously approved by the Escrow Agent and
Surviving Corporation (the " _Escrow Schedule_ "). Such Stockholder and In the
Money Optionholders right to receive their respective Pro Rata Escrow
Portion shall be solely a right of such Stockholder and In the Money
Optionholder to receive payments as provided in this §8(d). Such Pro Rata
Escrow Portion for each Stockholder and In the Money Optionholder shall
be deposited by Surviving Corporation as, for this purpose, agent of each
such Stockholder or In the Money Optionholder, who shall thereupon, without
any act by them, be treated as having received from Surviving Corporation
under §2(c)(iv)(F) hereof each such Stockholder and In the Money
Optionholders Pro Rata Escrow Portion and then as having deposited such Pro
Rata Escrow Portion into the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be security
for the indemnity obligations provided for in §8(b)(i) hereof. The Escrow
Fund shall be available to compensate the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any
claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for
which they are entitled to recovery under §8(b).

 

(e) _Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Periods_. Subject
to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence
immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m.,
local time at the Escrow Agents headquarters, on the Survival Date (the "
_Escrow Period_ "); _provided, however_ , that the Escrow Period shall not
terminate with respect to a portion of the Escrow Fund equal to the aggregate
amount of unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate delivered
to the Escrow Agent and the Shareholder Representative prior to the Escrow
Periods termination date with respect to facts and circumstances existing
prior to such date. As soon as all such claims have been resolved in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver to 

 



37  the Stockholders and In the Money Optionholders the remaining balance of
such portion which was not required to satisfy such claims. Deliveries of
applicable cash out of the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders and In the Money
Optionholders pursuant to this §8(e) shall be made in cash in proportion to
their respective initial Pro Rata Escrow Portions with the cash delivered to
each Stockholder and In the Money Optionholder rounded down to the nearest
cent.

(f) _Limitation on Buyer Indemnification Claims._

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary a Buyer
Indemnified Partys right to make claims under this §8 however, shall be
subject to the following limitations and conditions:

(i) except for any claim relating to a failure to comply with the
requirements of the New York Business Integrity Commission, for which no
threshold shall apply, no claim shall be made with respect to any Loss (or
series of related or similar Losses) unless and until the aggregate amount of
all such Losses exceeds $1,000,000, and then only to the extent of such
excess;

(ii) the sole and exclusive source of payment for a claim shall be limited to
the amount of cash held by the Escrow Agent from time to time pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement and no Buyer Indemnified Party shall seek recourse against
any other assets of any Stockholder or In the Money Optionholder for any
claims;

(iii) no Buyer Indemnified Party shall offer to compromise any claim
unless the same offer is made to all of the Stockholders and In the Money
Optionholders (similarly situated relative to the claim) based on their Pro
Rata Escrow Portion; and

 

(iv) no claim shall be made with respect to Losses arising out of any breach
(or facts constituting a breach) of this Agreement actually known by the
Buyer, Transitory Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates to exist
at or prior to the Closing Date.

 

None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, Surviving Corporation, or any of the
Stockholders or In the Money Optionholders may assign their rights in
the Escrow Fund or any interests therein without the prior written consent of
the Buyer and the Shareholder Representative

(g)  _Procedure for Indemnification._

(i) With respect to an indemnity claim sought by a Buyer Indemnified Party,
in order to seek indemnification under §8(b)(i), a Buyer Indemnified Party
shall promptly deliver an Officers Certificate to the Shareholder
Representative and Escrow Agent upon learning of such claim or the facts
constituting such claim.

(ii) With respect to an indemnity claim sought by a Seller Indemnified Party,
in order to seek indemnification under Section 8(b)(ii) a Seller Indemnified
Party shall promptly deliver an Officers Certificate to the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, upon learning of such claim or the facts constituting
such claim.

 



38 (iii) The indemnifying party will be relieved of its indemnification
obligations hereunder to the extent that it is prejudiced by the Indemnified
Partys failure to deliver an Officers Certificate promptly. The party from
whom indemnification is sought shall respond in writing to each claim
(pursuant to delivery of the Officers Certificate) within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the Officers Certificate. If such party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") objects to the indemnification such response shall be deemed to be
an " _Objection Notice_ ". No action shall be taken pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement or otherwise by the party seeking indemnification (unless
reasonably necessary to protect the rights of the party seeking
indemnification) until the expiration of the thirty (30) day response period.
In this regard:

(A) If the Indemnifying Party does not give a timely Objection Notice to the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Partys indemnification claim shall be
considered undisputed, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
the actual amount of its Losses as described in its Officers Certificate,
subject, in the case of an indemnification claim by Buyer, Transitory
Subsidiary or Surviving Corporation, to the limitations in §8(f).

(B) If the Indemnifying Party gives a Objection Notice to the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good
faith to resolve their differences during the 30-day period following the
Indemnifying Partys receipt of the Indemnified Partys Objection Notice. If
they fail to resolve their disagreement during this 30-day period, either of
them may unilaterally submit the disputed indemnification claim for binding
arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in Cincinnati, Ohio or
Chicago, Illinois in accordance with its rules for commercial arbitration in
effect at the time. The award of the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators may
include attorneys fees to the prevailing party. The award shall be final and
binding on the Parties, and judgment on the award may be entered and enforced
by any court having jurisdiction.

(iv) For purposes hereof, " _Officer s Certificate_" shall mean a
certificate signed by an officer of a Buyer Indemnified Party in connection
with indemnity sought by a Buyer Indemnified Party or the Shareholder
Representative with respect to indemnity sought by a Seller Indemnified
Party: (a) stating that the Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred,
or properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay,
sustain, incur or accrue Losses, and (b) specifying in reasonable detail
the individual item or items of Losses included in the amounts so stated, the
date each such item was paid, sustained, incurred or properly accrued or the
basis for such anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related.

(v) If a claim for indemnification hereunder is based on a claim by a third
party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the indemnifying party shall have the right
to assume the entire control of the defense thereof, including at its own
expense, employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in
any proceeding with counsel of its choice at its expense. In such event, the
indemnifying party shall have the right to settle or resolve any such Third
Party Claim;  _provided_ , that any such settlement or resolution
contemplated by the Shareholder Representative, acting on behalf of the
Stockholders and In the Money Optionholders (as the indemnifying party), that
involves any action by the 

 



39  Buyer other than the payment of money (which is to be paid in full, on
behalf of the Stockholders and In the Money Optionholders, from the Escrow
Fund (subject to the applicable conditions and limits contained in this §8))
shall not be concluded without the prior written approval of the Buyer
Indemnified Party, unless such approval is unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; and, _provided further_ , that any such settlement or resolution
contemplated by the Buyer as the indemnifying party that involves any action
other than the payment of money (which is to be paid in full by the Buyer)
shall not be concluded without the prior written approval of the Shareholder
Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

(vi) The party claiming indemnification shall cooperate fully with the
indemnifying party and make available to the indemnifying party all pertinent
information under its control and reasonably available or retrievable. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Transitory Subsidiary
will, and will cause employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully with the Shareholder Representative in
connection with any matter for which the Shareholder Representative, acting
on behalf of the Stockholders and In the Money Optionholders, is the
indemnifying party. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, (a)
assisting in the collection and preparation of discovery materials, (b)
meeting with (and making employees available to meet with) the Shareholder
Representative and/or his or its counsel to prepare for and/or appears as
witnesses at depositions, court proceedings and/or trial and (c) providing to
the Shareholder Representative and/or his or its counsel all information
under the control of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that
is deemed necessary by the Shareholder Representative and/or his or its
counsel for the defense or prosecution of such matter.

(h) _Subrogation._ If (i) the Shareholder Representative authorizes any
indemnification payment hereunder, and (ii) the Buyer, Transitory Subsidiary
or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries has or may have a claim
against a third party (including, without limitation, any insurer) in respect
of the related Losses, the Shareholder Representative, on behalf of the
Stockholders and In the Money Optionholders, shall be subrogated to the rights
and claims of the Buyer, Transitory Subsidiary, or the Surviving Corporation
and such Subsidiary, as the case may be, against such thirty party. The
Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and In the Money
Optionholders) shall not, however, have the right to collect aggregate
payments from such third party or third parties in excess of the actual
amount of the indemnification payment previously paid from the Escrow Fund
with respect to such Losses. The Buyer Transitory Subsidiary and the Surviving
Corporation will, and will cause the Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver to
the Shareholder Representative such documents and take such other actions as
may reasonably be requested in order to give effect to this §8(h).

(i) _Fees._ All fees (including attorneys fees) of the Escrow Agent for
performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the standard fee
schedule of the Escrow Agent previously delivered to Buyer. It is understood
that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent
shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not
promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided
for in this Agreement but that has been requested by an officer 

 



40  of Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, or if the
parties request a substantial modification of the terms of the Agreement, or
if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or
intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject
matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such
extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees,
including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such
default, delay, controversy or litigation.

 

(j) _Shareholder Representative._

(i) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, each of the Stockholders shall be deemed to
have agreed to appoint Joseph Mayernik, as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as
the " _Shareholder Representative_ " for and on behalf of the Stockholders to
take all actions under this Agreement that are to be taken by the Shareholder
Representative. The Shareholder Representative is authorized and empowered to
take any and all actions which it believes are reasonably necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement, including without limitation giving and
receiving notices and communications, to authorize payment to any
Buyer Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any
Buyer Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims,
to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to, any other claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party against any
Stockholder or In the Money Optionholder or by any such Stockholder or In the
Money Optionholder against any Buyer Indemnified Party or any dispute between
any Buyer Indemnified Party and any such Stockholder or In the Money
Optionholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the
terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed from time to time upon not
less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Buyer Indemnified Parties;
_provided, however_ , that the Shareholder Representative may not be removed
unless holders of seventy-five percent (75%) interest of the Escrow Fund agree

duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel retained by the Shareholder Representative (" _Shareholder
Representative Expenses_ "). This indemnification shall survive termination
of this Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder
Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement,
shall constitute a decision of the Stockholders and In the
Money Optionholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Stockholders and In the Money Optionholders; and the Escrow Agent and Buyer
may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Stockholders and In the Money Optionholders. The Shareholder
Representative may in all questions arising under this Agreement seek advice
of legal counsel, and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by
the Shareholder Representative in accordance with such advice, the Shareholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder or In the Money
Optionholder. The Escrow Agent and Buyer Indemnified Parties are hereby
relieved from any liability to any person for any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholder Representative.

action as the Shareholder Representative is authorized to take under this
Agreement; (C) receiving all documents or certificates and making all
determinations, in its capacity as Shareholder Representative, required under
this Agreement; and (D) all such actions as may be necessary to carry out any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which
indemnification is sought pursuant to this §8 and any waiver of any
obligation of Buyer, Transitory Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation.

 

(l) _Reasonable Reliance._ In the performance of its duties hereunder, the
Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to (i) rely upon any document or
instrument reasonably believed to be genuine, accurate as to content and

hereunder and (ii) assume that any person purporting to give any notice in
accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.

transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or
enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall be
made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then
and in any such event, the Shareholder Representative is authorized, in its
sole discretion, but in good faith, to rely upon and comply with any such
order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected
by it is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action; and if
the Shareholder Representative complies with any such order, writ, judgment
or decree, he shall not be liable to any Stockholder or In the Money

such order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled set aside or vacated.

(n) _Expenses of the Shareholder Representative._ The Shareholder
Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement of all expenses incurred in
connection with its duties as Shareholder Representative hereunder from the
Stockholders and In the Money Optionholders based on their respective Pro
Rata Escrow Portion. If a Stockholder or In the Money Optionholder shall
default in its or their obligations to reimburse the Shareholder
Representative hereunder, the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to
withhold from distribution to the defaulting Stockholder and In the Money
Optionholder an amount equal to such defaulted obligation.

(o) _Irrevocable Appointment._ Subject to §8(j), the appointment of the
Shareholder Representative hereunder is irrevocable and any action taken by

shall be effective and absolutely binding as the action of the Shareholder

any suit, action, or proceeding against any other Party (or any other Person)
with respect to this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise,
