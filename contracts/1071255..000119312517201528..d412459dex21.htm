and/or require the Stockholder to suspend use of any resale prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement for any period of time determined by the Company if there shall occur a Material Disclosure Event (such period, a &#147;<B>Suspension

determination run consecutively for a given Material Disclosure Event), during any consecutive 12 month period; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if the Company deems in good faith that it is necessary to file a post-effective amendment to the
Shelf Registration Statement in order to comply with Section&nbsp;2 hereof, then such period of time from the date of filing of such post-effective amendment until the date on which such Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC

effect that such suspension has terminated. Any Suspension Notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President or any Vice President of the Company confirming the existence of the Material
Disclosure Event. If so directed by the Company, Stockholder will deliver to the Company (at the Company&#146;s expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in Stockholder&#146;s possession, of the most recent prospectus(es) covering
such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such Suspension Notice. The Company covenants and agrees that it will not deliver a Suspension Notice with respect to a Suspension Period unless the Company&#146;s employees, officers and
directors are also prohibited by the Company for the duration of such Suspension Period from effecting any public sales of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock beneficially owned by them. In the event of a Suspension Notice, the Company shall,
promptly after such time as the related Material Disclosure Event no longer exists, provide notice to the Stockholder that the Suspension Period has ended, and take any and all actions necessary or desirable to give effect to Stockholder&#146;s
rights under this Agreement that may have been affected by such notice, including Stockholder&#146;s Demand Registration rights and rights with respect to a Shelf Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a valid postponement or
suspension of the filing of a registration statement shall not diminish the obligation of the Company to continue preparations for the filing of such registration statement during the Suspension Period. </P>

related actions or proceedings) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered and sold under the
Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information about Stockholder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of Stockholder specifically for use in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus,
summary prospectus, amendment or supplement; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Stockholder shall not be liable for any amounts in excess of the net proceeds (after deducting Selling Expenses) received by Stockholder from sales of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such registration statement; and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that Stockholder shall not be liable for any Loss that arises out of Company&#146;s failure to update, supplement or amend the prospectus after Stockholder has
provided the Company with information correcting such statement or omission with a reasonable opportunity to amend or correct such prospectus. </P>

the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Section&nbsp;7, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written
notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding
paragraphs of this Section&nbsp;7, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party&#146;s
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties exists with respect to such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such claim upon written notice to the indemnified party
within 30 days of its receipt of notice of the claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (i)&nbsp;the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses or (ii)&nbsp;the indemnifying
party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person and to continue diligently pursuing such defense. If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party as permitted hereunder,
the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If such defense is assumed by the
indemnifying party pursuant to the provisions hereof, such indemnifying party shall not settle or otherwise compromise the applicable claim unless (A)&nbsp;such settlement or compromise contains a full and unconditional release of the indemnified
party or (B)&nbsp;the indemnified party otherwise consents in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will be
obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one counsel (plus local counsel to the extent reasonably necessary to defend against such claim) for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim.

reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, and the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. No indemnified party

indemnified party on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party, and by such party&#146;s relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section,

the Exchange Act, it shall use its reasonable efforts to file in a timely manner all reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and to comply with the requirements of Rule 144(c), as it may be amended from time to time (or any similar
rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC), regarding the availability of current public information to the extent required to enable Stockholder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act pursuant to the
resale provisions of Rule 144 (or any similar rule or regulation). Upon the request of the Stockholder, the Company will promptly deliver to Stockholder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements and, upon
Stockholder&#146;s compliance with the applicable provisions of Rule 144 and its delivery of such documents and certificates as the Company&#146;s transfer agent may reasonably request in connection therewith, will take such reasonable action as may
be required (including using its reasonable efforts to cause legal counsel to issue an appropriate opinion) to cause its transfer agent to effectuate any transfer of Registrable Securities properly requested by Stockholder, in accordance with the
