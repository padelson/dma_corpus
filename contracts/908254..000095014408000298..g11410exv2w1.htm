it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for discussions or negotiations
with the Company or the Representatives relating to an Acquisition Proposal (in each case within 24
hours of receipt thereof), and the Company shall provide to Parent (within such 24 hour time frame)
the number of persons or group making such Acquisition Proposals and a written summary of the

the Acquisition Proposal). Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the No-Shop Period Start

confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company
from providing such information to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that,
