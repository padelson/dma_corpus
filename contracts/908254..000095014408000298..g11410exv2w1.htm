of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub
or the holders of any shares of outstanding common stock of the Company, par
value $0.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), or the other securities
described below: 

   

 (a) _Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(c) or shares of the Company Common Stock owned by any of the Company Subsidiaries which shall remain outstanding) and Restricted Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.3(b), shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $34.50 in cash, without interest (the "Per Share Price"), payable to the holder thereof (the "Merger Consideration"), upon the surrender in accordance with Section 2.4 of the certificate that formerly evidenced such shares, or as otherwise specified for Book-Entry Shares (as defined below), with this provision being for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Book Entry Shares or a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right, subject to Section 2.5 and Section 2.6, to receive the applicable Merger Consideration therefor. 

  

 (b) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into, be exchanged for and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 (c) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (d) _Adjustments_. The Per Share Price shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reclassification or like transaction affecting the Company Common Stock after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

 

Section 2.2 _Dissenting Shares_. 

   

 (a) Dissenters rights under the TBCA are not available to the holders of Company Common Stock for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless the Company Common Stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market (including any successor exchange, "NASDAQ") prior to the Effective Time. 

 

Section 2.3 _Company Options, Restricted Shares, Stock Appreciation Rights
and ESPP_. Except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the Company
and Parent prior to the Effective Time: 

    ##### 

  

     

 (a) The Company shall ensure that, (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Options") granted under the Companys 1993 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan, as amended, 1993 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (collectively, the "Equity Incentive Plans"), shall become fully vested and exercisable (without regard to whether the Company Options are then vested or exercisable), (ii) at the Effective Time, all Company Options not theretofore exercised shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, converted into the right to receive a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation in an amount equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise price of each such Company Option and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such option to the extent not previously exercised (such payment, if any, to be net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.5), and (iii) after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment described in subsection (ii) without interest. In the event the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to a Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that such Company Option shall be cancelled without consideration and have no further force or effect. 

  

 (b) The Company shall ensure that, (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, "Restricted Shares") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such restrictions (without regard to whether the Restricted Shares are then vested or the applicable restrictions have then lapsed) and (ii) at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Price with respect to each such Restricted Share in accordance with Section 2.1, less any required withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 2.5. 

  

 (c) The Company shall ensure that, (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of a right under any Equity Incentive Plan (other than Company Options) entitling the holder thereof to shares of Company Common Stock based on the value of Company Common Stock (collectively, "SARs") which, in each case, is outstanding as of the Effective Time, shall vest and become free of any lapse restrictions (without regard to whether the SARs are then vested or exercisable) and, as of the Effective Time be cancelled, and (ii) at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a cash payment, subject to any appreciation cap set forth in such SAR, from the Surviving Corporation in consideration for such cancellation, in an amount equal to the product of (1) the number of SARs and (2) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the grant price of each such SAR, less any required withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 2.5. 

  

 (d) The provisions of Section 2.3(a) shall not apply to the ESPP (as defined below). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that (i) all offering periods in progress under the Companys Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan(the "ESPP" and, together with the Equity Incentive Plans, the "Equity Plans") are terminated immediately following the date hereof, (ii) there will be no increase in the amount of payroll deductions to be made by participants after the date hereof, (iii) with respect to persons participating in the ESPP on the date on which the offering periods cease (and who have not withdrawn from or otherwise ceased participation in the ESPP prior to such date), accumulated contributions will be deemed to have been applied on such date to the purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with the ESPPs terms (treating the date of termination as the last day of the relevant offering period), (iv) at the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issuable under the ESPP will be deemed to 

   ##### 

  

 

have been cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, such that, as of the Effective Time, on a net basis, each
participant shall be entitled to receive, without interest and less any
applicable withholding Taxes, an amount in cash equal to the excess of (1)
the product of (x) the number of Shares that the participant is deemed to have
acquired pursuant to the terms of the ESPP and (y) the Per Share Price, over
(2) the aggregate amount of the participants purchase price deemed to have
been paid in connection with the deemed purchase, and (v) there are no
outstanding rights of participants under the ESPP following the Effective
Time. The aggregate amount specified in Sections 2.3(a), (b), (c) and (d)
with respect to the Company Options, Restricted Shares, SARs and ESPP
"Options" is referred to herein as the "Cash Out Amount." 

   

 (e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, the Equity Incentive Plans shall terminate and that no person shall have any right under the Equity Incentive Plans, except as set forth herein (including, to the extent necessary, using reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary consents of the holders of Company Options and SARs in order to give effect to this Section 2.3). 

  

 (f) At or promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deliver the applicable Cash Out Amount to the holders of Company Options, Restricted Shares, SARs and ESPP "Options," without interest and less any applicable withholding Taxes. 

 

Section 2.4 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and to receive the funds to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock will become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the Paying Agent cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). If for any reason the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under Section 2.1, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments of Merger Consideration, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each (i) record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of the Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) holder, as of the Effective Time, of shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares"), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only, subject to Section 2.4(c), upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and/or instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and/or such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry 

   ##### 

  

 

Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or applicable
book-entry shall then be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for
the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Until surrendered for cancellation as contemplated by this Section
2.4(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this Section 2. 

   

 (c) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or Parent with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto without interest. 

  

 (d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and thereafter there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2 without interest. 

  

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the date that is one year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

 

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Company and the

employee, director or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary

the Plan, or, if the Plan has not been reduced to writing, a written summary

The section numbers of the Parent Disclosure Schedule are numbered to correspond to the section numbers of this Agreement to which they refer.

corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Parent and Merger Sub are duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or organization to do
business, and are in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by them or the nature of their
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such
failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not
reasonably be likely to prevent or materially delay Parents and Merger Subs
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (a "Parent Material
Adverse Effect"). Parent has made available to the Company a complete and
correct copy of the articles of organization and bylaws or other applicable
governing instruments of Parent and Merger Sub.

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger
Sub. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger
Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation
of the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against them in accordance with its terms, except to the extent

 (b) No consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any third party or Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than (i) filing of a pre-merger notification report under the HSR Act, (ii) the filing with the SEC of such reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee and any appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which Parent or Merger Sub is qualified to do business, (iv) compliance with and filings under the merger control, competition or fair trade Laws of any foreign jurisdiction, if and to the extent required, (v) as set forth in Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (vi) such items that have not had, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

 

Section 4.4 _Information in the Proxy Statement_. The information supplied by
Parent and Merger Sub expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not
contain at the time it is first mailed to the shareholders of the Company or
at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, any untrue statement of a

therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

Section 4.5 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is
no Action pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent
or Merger Sub before any Governmental Entity that would or seeks to delay or
prevent the consummation of the Merger. As of the date of this Agreement,

    ##### 

  

    

Section 4.6 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true
and complete copies of (i) the Equity Commitment Letters, dated as of the
date hereof (collectively, the "Equity Commitment Letters"), by and between
Parent and each of Blackstone Capital Partners V L.P. and Wellspring Capital
Partners IV, L.P. (each, a "Sponsor" and collectively, the
"Sponsors"), respectively, pursuant to which each Sponsor has committed to
provide certain of the cash equity financing to Parent in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) the executed debt commitment
letters, dated as of the date hereof, among (A) Parent, Wellspring
Distribution Corp. ("WDC"), Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, Wachovia Bank,
National Association, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Credit Suisse,
Cayman Islands Branch, GE Capital Markets, Inc. and General Electric Capital
Corporation (the "Senior Debt Commitment Letter") and (B) Parent,
WDC,Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and Wachovia Investment Holdings, LLC, DLJ
Investment Partners, Inc., Blackstone Mezzanine Partners II L.P., Blackstone
VPS Capital Partners V L.P., Blackstone VPS Capital Partners V-AC L.P.,
Blackstone Participation Partnership V VPS L.P., Blackstone Family Investment
Partnership V VPS L.P., Blackstone Family Investment Partnership V-SMD L.P.
and Wellspring Capital Partners IV, L.P. (the "Subordinated Debt Commitment
Letter", and together with the Senior Debt Commitment Letter, the "Debt
Commitment Letters"), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to provide
the debt financing (the "Debt Financing") to Parent that is necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Equity Commitment
Letters, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, are sometimes referred to
collectively herein as, the "Commitment Letters," and the amounts committed
pursuant to the Commitment Letters being, the "Financing." As of the date
hereof, the commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and the Commitment Letters have not
been amended or modified. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are
in full force and effect in the form so delivered and the Commitment Letters
constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Parent, and to the
knowledge of the Parent, the other parties thereto. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies, side agreements or other arrangements or
understandings related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or
the terms thereof, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the
Commitment Letters (the "Disclosed Conditions"), and no Person has any right
to impose, and neither the Lenders nor Parent has any obligation to accept
(i) any condition precedent to such funding other than the Disclosed
Conditions nor (ii) any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the
Debt Commitment Letters on the Closing Date (nor any term or condition
which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount under the Debt
Commitment Letters on the Closing Date). Parent has fully paid all commitment
fees required in connection with the Debt Commitment Letters. Assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.3, the
aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters will be sufficient
when funded for Parent and the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration, the Cash Out Amount and any other payments contemplated
in this Agreement (including the refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness
of the Company) and to pay all fees and expenses related to the
Financing, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied
or that the Financing will not be available to Merger Sub on the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing
under this Agreement for Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or any
alternative financing. 

  

Section 4.7 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company limited
guarantees in favor of the Company, dated the date hereof, of each Sponsor
with respect to certain matters on the terms specified therein (the "Limited
Guarantees" ). Each Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect
and constitutes the legal, valid and 

     ##### 

  

    

binding obligations of its respective guarantor, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, and has not been amended, withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. 

  

Section 4.8 _Parent and Merger Sub_. 

   

 (a) Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective Time has engaged in no other business activities and has incurred no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, directly or indirectly, owned by Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no options, warrants, rights or other agreements pursuant to which any person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub. 

  

 (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub do not own (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) and is not a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than as contemplated by this Agreement). There are no Contracts between Parent, Merger Sub or any affiliate thereof, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate in any way to the Company or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the Company Board of Directors approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby for purposes of the applicable provisions of the Tennessee Business Combination Act, neither Parent nor Merger Sub, alone or together with any other person, was at any time, or became, an "interested shareholder" thereunder or has taken any action that would cause any anti-takeover statute under the Tennessee Business Combination Act to be applicable to this Agreement. 

  

 (c) No vote of the stockholders of Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise) is required by any applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of Parent in order for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

Section 4.9 _Brokers_. Other than Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC,
Goldman, Sachs and Co., and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, no broker,
finder, agent or similar intermediary has acted on behalf of Sponsors, Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and there are no brokerage commissions, finders fees or
similar fees or commissions payable in connection herewith based on any
agreement, arrangement or understanding with Sponsors, Parent or Merger Sub
or any of their respective affiliates, or any action taken by Sponsors,
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates. 

  

Section 4.10 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming (i) satisfaction
of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the
merger, or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties in Section 3 hereof (without giving effect to
any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifiers) and (iii)
solely for the purposes of this Section 4.10, the projections or forecasts
provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared
in good faith on reasonable assumptions, immediately after giving effect to
all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration and the consideration in respect of the Cash
Out Amount, any other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be 

    ##### 

  

    

contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, and payment of all related fees
and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent.
For purposes of this Section 4.10, the term "Solvent" with respect to each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation means that, as of any date of
determination, (a) the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, respectively exceeds, as of such
date, the sum of (i) the value of all liabilities of Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, respectively, including contingent and other
liabilities, as of such date, as such terms are generally determined in
accordance with the applicable Tennessee (in the case of the
Surviving Corporation), Colorado (in the case of Parent) and federal (in the
case of each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent) Laws governing
determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole, on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such
debts become absolute and matured; (b) each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the business in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
following such date; (c) each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature in the ordinary course of business; and (d)
the satisfaction of any other solvency requirement set forth in the TBCA or
pursuant to the Colorado Business Corporation Act, or federal Laws applicable
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. For the purposes of this definition,
"not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses for which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" means that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will be able to generate
enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. 

  

Section 4.11 _No Other Representations or Warranties; Investigation
by Parent_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that (a) it
has had an opportunity to discuss the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with the management of the Company, (b) it has had reasonable
access to (i) the books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and (ii) the electronic dataroom maintained by the Company
through Intralinks, Inc. for purposes of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (c) it has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of
and receive answers from executive officers of the Company and (d) except for
the representations and warranties contained in this Section 3, and any
certificates delivered by the Company in connection with Closing, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub have relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
Company or with respect to any information made available to Parent or Merger
Sub in connection with the transaction contemplated hereunder. Neither the
Company nor any other person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other person
resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub, or Parents or Merger
Subs use of, any such information, including any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent or Merger
Sub or their respective representatives in certain data rooms or management
presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, unless any such information is expressly included in a
representation or warranty contained in Section 3 or in the corresponding
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

and other institutional customers, franchises and corporate-owned units
of casual and family dining and quick-service restaurants (collectively,
"Food Distribution Providers") with annual revenues in excess of $5 billion
or any Affiliate thereof unless such Food Distribution Provider has made a
Superior Proposal at a higher price than the Per Share Price and (x)
completed legal, financial and accounting due diligence (other than with
respect to the withheld information), (y) provided firm financing commitments
to the Company, and (z) agreed to contract terms and conditions in each case
(including with respect to any regulatory filings and approvals) no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in
this Agreement; and (ii) enter into and maintain or continue discussions or
negotiations with respect to Acquisition Proposals or otherwise cooperate
with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable
in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreements (it being understood and agreed that such
confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of any
Acquisition Proposal). From the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (it
being understood such efforts do not include an obligation to commence
litigation) to enforce the employee non-solicit/no-hire provisions of any
confidentiality agreement entered into with any person whether prior to, on
or after the date of this Agreement and the provision thereof requiring the
other party thereto to keep confidential any proprietary, confidential
information about the Company obtained by such person pursuant to such
confidentiality agreement (it being understood that the Company may provide
any consent and grant any approval contemplated by any such confidentiality
agreement including, without limitation, any consent or approval necessary
to permit such other party to make an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Company waives the standstill provision in any such
confidentiality agreement, it will waive the standstill provision in the
Confidentiality Agreements). 

   

 (b) Except as permitted by this Section 5.2 and except as may relate to any Excluded Party, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective directors and officers shall, and the Company shall cause the other Representatives, to (i) on the No-Shop Period Start Date, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8, not (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal or (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal. No later than 48 hours after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the number of Excluded Parties, the identity of each such Excluded Party, and the Company shall furnish to Parent (within such 48 hour period) a copy of the Acquisition Proposal made by each such Excluded Party. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b) but subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.2(c), if, at any time on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company or any of the Representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal by any person or group, which Acquisition 

   ##### 

  

 

Proposal was made on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and which did not
arise from or in connection with a breach of this Section 5.2, (i) the
Company and the Representatives may contact such person or group to clarify
the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) if the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith (A) after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, the Company and Representatives may (x) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the person or group who has made such Acquisition
Proposal (provided that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent
and Merger Sub any non-public information concerning the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries that is made available to any person given such access
which was not previously made available to Parent and Merger Sub), and (y)
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions and negotiations regarding
such Acquisition Proposal. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall promptly advise Parent of the receipt by the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal made on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date or any
request for non-public information made by any person or group that has
informed the Company it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any
request for discussions or negotiations with the Company or the
Representatives relating to an Acquisition Proposal (in each case within
24 hours of receipt thereof), and the Company shall provide to Parent (within
such 24 hour time frame) the number of persons or group making such
Acquisition Proposals and a written summary of the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the person or group
making the Acquisition Proposal). Without limiting the foregoing, from and
after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company will also promptly notify
Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information
or to engage in discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Following
the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall keep Parent informed on a
reasonably current basis of any material change to the terms and conditions
of any Acquisition Proposal (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any
amendment or modification to any Acquisition Proposal made by an Excluded
Party). The Company agrees that it and the Company Subsidiaries will not enter
into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the date
hereof which prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that, notwithstanding the
commencement of the obligations of the Company under Section 5.2(b) on
the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may, prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, continue to engage in the activities described
in clause (i) and/or (ii) of Section 5.2(a) with respect to any Excluded
Parties on and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, including with respect to
any amended or revised proposal submitted by such Excluded Parties on or after
the No-Shop Period Start Date, and this Section 5.2(c) shall not apply with
respect thereto. 

   

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Excluded Party" means any person, group of persons or group that includes any person (so long as such person and the other members of such group, if any, who were members of such group immediately prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date constitute at least 50% of the equity financing of such group at all times following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the termination of this Agreement) from whom the Company or any of the Representatives has received a written Acquisition Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date that the Company Board of Directors believes in good faith is bona fide and constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; provided that any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all purposes under this Agreement at such time as the Acquisition Proposal (as such Acquisition Proposal may be revised during the course of ongoing negotiations, in which event it may temporarily cease to be a Superior 

   ##### 

  

 

Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal, so long as such negotiations are ongoing and,
the Company Board of Directors in good faith determines that, it subsequently
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal) made by such person fails to constitute either
a Superior Proposal or, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board of
Directors, an Acquisition Proposal that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal. 

   

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, offer or proposal, on its most recently amended and modified terms, from any person or group other than Parent or any of its affiliates relating to any transaction or proposed transaction or series of related transactions involving: (A) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of a twenty percent (20%) interest or more in the total outstanding shares of equity or voting securities of the Company or any Company Significant Subsidiary, or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or "group" beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the total outstanding shares of equity or voting securities of the Company, (B) any sale or disposition of consolidated assets of the Company (including for this purpose the outstanding assets, rights and equity securities of the Company Subsidiaries) to any person or "group" for consideration equal to twenty percent (20%) or more of the aggregate fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, or (C) any consolidation, merger, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary whose business constitutes 20% percent or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal made in writing and not solicited in violation of Section 5.2(b), on its most recently amended and modified terms (with all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal changed to 50%), that is on terms that the Company Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) would, if consummated, be more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby (x) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation (as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby) and (y) after taking into account all material legal, financial (including the financing terms of any such Acquisition Proposal), regulatory or other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (f) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2, neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation (as defined in Section 6.2 below); (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), whether taken by the Company Board of Directors or a committee thereof, an "Adverse Recommendation Change"); or (iii) cause or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or any similar agreement or understanding (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) relating to an Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (g) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, if (1) the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that the Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (B) below or (2) there has occurred a material development or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof that was 

   ##### 

  

 

not known to the Company or the Company Board of Directors as of or prior to
the date hereof (and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material
development or change in circumstances an "Intervening Event"), and the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel that, in light of such Intervening Event, the
failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board of Directors may (x)
make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) in the case of clause (1)
above only, terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to do so could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; provided, however, the Company Board
of Directors may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
the foregoing clause (x) and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (y) unless: 

   

(A) the Company has complied in all material respects with this Section 5.2;

   

(B) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger
Sub, at least 48 hours in advance (the "Notice Period"), of its intention
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Superior
Proposal and/or to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, or otherwise make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in the circumstance referred to above, which
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the person or group making the Superior
Proposal) or the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change in the
absence of an Acquisition Proposal, and contemporaneously with providing such
notice, as applicable, shall have provided a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other
material documents, if any; and

   

(C) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal or otherwise in the circumstance referred to above
and/or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
legal and financial advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub
desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal or such Adverse Recommendation Change is no longer
required. In the event that during the Notice Period any revisions are made
to the Superior Proposal and the Company Board of Directors in its good faith
judgment determines such revisions are material (it being agreed that any
change in the purchase price in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed
a material revision), the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and Merger Sub and to comply with the requirements of this
Section 5.2(g)(i) with respect to such new written notice, except that the
Notice Period shall be reduced to 24 hours.

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be entitled to enter into any agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to a Superior Proposal unless this Agreement is concurrently terminated by its terms pursuant to Section 8.1(g) and the Company has paid concurrently to Parent the termination fee payable pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(ii). With respect to persons with whom discussions or 

   ##### 

  

 

negotiations have been terminated, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to require such persons to promptly return or destroy in
accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement any
confidential information furnished by the Company. No Adverse Recommendation
Change shall change the approval of the Company Board of Directors
for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state Law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to
the restrictions on the Companys ability to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change as set forth in Section 5.2(g)(i), nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from complying
with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board of Directors, after consultation with outside
counsel, the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to violate
its obligations under applicable Law or is otherwise required under
applicable Law; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Company
Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend
that the Company shareholders tender any securities in connection with
any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal), unless in each case, in connection therewith, the
Company Board of Directors effects an Adverse Recommendation Change; provided
further that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board of Directors expressly
reaffirms the Company Recommendation at least two business days prior to
the Company Shareholders Meeting if Parent has delivered to the Company a
written request to so reaffirm at least 48 hours (or if 48 hours is
impracticable, as far in advance as is practicable) prior to the time such
reaffirmation is to be made. 

  

Section 5.3 _Employee Matters_. 

   

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Continuing Employee may have under any Plans, until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the "Benefits Continuation Period"), the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to each employee who is a continuing employee of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees") salary, wages, cash incentive opportunities, severance, medical and other welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements and benefits which are at least comparable in the aggregate to those provided prior to the Closing Date under the Plans or otherwise; provided, that with respect to Continuing Employees who are subject to employment and/or change in control agreements or arrangements that have not been superseded by agreements with Parent (the "Employment Agreements"), the Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume such Employment Agreements and fulfill all obligations thereunder in lieu of the foregoing. During the Benefits Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation shall pay, subject to such terms and conditions as it shall establish and the terms of applicable Employment Agreements, any such Continuing Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries without cause an amount of severance pay in cash equal to the amount of cash severance pay that would have been payable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the severance policy maintained by the Company and applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the date of this Agreement or, if applicable, such Continuing Employees Employment Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation that a Continuing 

   ##### 

  

 

Employee is eligible to participate in following the Effective Time to the
extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been
satisfied by, such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time under the relevant Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated,
(ii) provide each such Continuing Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductible paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent
such credit was given under the analogous Plan prior to the Effective Time)
in satisfying any applicable deductibles or out-of-pocket requirements and
(iii) to the extent that any Continuing Employee is allowed to participate in
any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their subsidiaries following the Effective Time, cause such plan to recognize
the service of such Continuing Employee with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit accrual (but not for benefit accrual under
any defined benefit, retiree welfare, qualified or similar plan) to the extent
of such service. 

   

 (c) Parent and Company acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 5.3 shall not interfere with the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any Plan (subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(a) and (b) above) or to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason, subject to the terms of applicable Employment Agreements. The provisions of this Section 5.3 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors of any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 5.3) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of the Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to the Company Common Stock) resulting from the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by Section 2 of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

Section 6\. _Additional Agreements_. 

  

Section 6.1 _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following the date hereof but in any event within twenty (20)
business days hereof, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form, and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the Companys shareholders as promptly as practicable after filing with the
SEC. If at any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval
there shall occur any event that should, upon the advice of the Companys
outside legal counsel, be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement so that the 

    ##### 

  

    

Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly prepare, file
with the SEC and mail to its shareholders such an amendment or
supplement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or any other SEC filing required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (or, in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, the party responsible for filing or mailing such
document shall provide the other party an opportunity to review and comment
on such document or response and shall include in such document or response
comments reasonably proposed by the other party. 

  

Section 6.2 _Company Shareholders  Meeting_. The Company shall, as soon
as practicable following the date hereof, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholders Meeting")
for the purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder Approval. Subject to
Section 5.2, the Companys Board of Directors (or any committee thereof)
shall recommend adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the
shareholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (the "Company Recommendation"). Unless such recommendation shall
have been modified or withdrawn in accordance with Section 5.2, the Company
shall take all action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its
shareholders proxies in favor of the proposal to approve this Agreement and
shall take all other reasonable actions necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of the shareholders of the Company that are required by the
NASDAQ rules or the TBCA. The obligation of the Company to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be
affected by an Adverse Recommendation Change unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Section 8.1(g). Without the prior written
consent of Parent, adoption of this Agreement is the only matter (other than
procedural matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted upon by
its shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting. 

  

Section 6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Prior to the Effective
Time, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party prior to
the date hereof, or as would be reasonably expected to violate the attorney-
client privilege of the Company or a Company Subsidiary (it being agreed that
the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause such information
to be provided in a manner that does not cause such violation, including
entering into customary joint defense agreements), the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its directors,
employees, representatives, financial advisors, lenders, legal
counsel, accountants and other advisors and representatives, such access to
the books and records, financial, operating and other data, assets,
properties, facilities, plants, offices, auditors, authorized
representatives, business and operations of the Company as is reasonably
necessary or appropriate in connection with Parents review of the Company
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Any such review shall
be conducted at reasonable times upon reasonable advance notice and under
reasonable circumstances so as to minimize disruption to or impairment of the
Companys business. In order that Parent may have a full opportunity to make
such investigation and, provided such persons are bound by the
confidentiality agreement dated as of June 4, 2007 between Blackstone
Management Partners V L.L.C. and the Company or the confidentiality agreement
dated as of August 2, 2007 between Wellspring Capital Management and the
Company (the "Existing Confidentiality Agreement", and together with any
confidentiality agreement executed prior to the date hereof between the
Company and Parent, the "Confidentiality Agreements"), or have otherwise
agreed to be bound to the provisions of such agreement applicable to
representatives, the Company shall furnish the 

     ##### 

  

    

representatives of Parent or Sponsors during such period with all such
information and copies of such documents concerning the affairs of the
Company as such representatives may reasonably request. The information and
documents so provided shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreements. No information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section
6.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made
by the Company set forth in this Agreement, or otherwise impair the rights
and remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub hereunder. 

  

Section 6.4 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_. 

   

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make and shall cause their affiliates or owners to use reasonable best efforts to make all filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, application or submission of other documents required by any Governmental Entity or any foreign labor organization or works council in connection with the Merger, including, without limitation: (i) the filings identified on Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that are required to be made with a Governmental Entity, (ii) pre-merger notification reports to be filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") as required by the HSR Act, (iii) filings required by the merger notification or control Laws, and any other applicable antitrust or fair trade Law, of any applicable foreign jurisdiction or filings required by any foreign labor organization or works council, (iv) any filings required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable state or securities or "blue sky" laws and the securities laws of any foreign country, or (v) any other applicable Laws or rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity relating to, and material to the consummation of, the Merger. 

  

 (b) Subject to restrictions required by Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company shall promptly supply, and shall cause their affiliates or owners promptly to supply, the others with any information which may be reasonably required in order to make any filings or applications pursuant to Section 6.4(a). 

  

 (c) Subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions or restrictions required by Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will notify the others promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments or questions from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto or the Merger itself and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to any applicable Laws and rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity or answers to any questions, or the production of any documents, relating to an investigation of the Merger by any Governmental Entity. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 6.4(a), Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall provide to the other parties (or their respective advisors) upon request copies of all correspondence between such party and any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In addition, to the extent reasonably 

   ##### 

  

 

practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and meetings with a
Governmental Entity regarding the Merger shall include representatives of
Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company. Subject to applicable Law, the parties
will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, and proposals made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger by or on behalf
of any party. 

   

 (d) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger, including using its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the causing of all of the conditions set forth in Section 7 to the other parties obligations to consummate the Merger to be satisfied and to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, expirations of all necessary waiting periods, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities required by it and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) required by it, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties (provided, however, in no event shall obtaining any such consent, approval or waivers be required as a condition to Closing hereunder), (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger to which it is a party, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger, and to carry out fully the purposes of, this Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary actions. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties shall request and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent agrees to take, and to cause its affiliates and owners to take, whatever action may be necessary to resolve as promptly as possible any objections relating to the consummation of the Merger as may be asserted under the HSR Act or any other applicable merger control, antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws with respect to the Merger. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, upon Parents request, the Company shall take all reasonable actions and cooperate with Parent in restructuring the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or similar organizational transactions (the "Parent Restructuring"), it being understood that the Parent Restructuring shall become effective only on and as of the Effective Time; provided that none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any out-of-pocket costs or incur any other liability in connection with the Parent Restructuring prior to the Effective Time except for any liabilities that are conditioned on the Effective Time having occurred. 

 

Section 6.5 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) The charter and/or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification not less favorable than those set forth in the charter and bylaws of the Company as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not, except as necessary to comply with applicable Law, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at, or prior to, the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company.

 (b) The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law or under the Companys charter, bylaws or any applicable indemnification agreements, and regardless of whether the Merger becomes effective, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, each present and former director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, agent or other fiduciary of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including in connection with this Agreement or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any Indemnified Party becomes involved in any actual or threatened suit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation with respect to which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.5 after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, promptly advance to such Indemnified Party his or her legal expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith); provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent then required by the TBCA, to repay such advances if it is finally judicially determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Any determination required to be made, for purpose of this Section 6.5 in advance of final judicial determination, with respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complied with the standards set forth under Tennessee law, the Companys charter, bylaws or indemnification agreements, as the case may be, shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to Parent and the Indemnified Party. 

  

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to indemnification agreements with the Companys directors, officers, employees or agents existing at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or, subject to Section 6.5(a), under the relevant charter or bylaws. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual claim for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. The Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to seek indemnification hereunder. 

  

 (d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a "tail" insurance policy from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance that provides coverage for the six years following the Effective Time at least comparable in amount and scope to the coverage provided under the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the Effective Time for the individuals who are or were directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for claims arising from facts or events occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such directors and officers insurance policy (such amount, the " _Premium Cap_ "); provided further, that if the cost of such "tail" insurance policy would 

   ##### 

  

 

exceed the Premium Cap, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum
amount of "tail" insurance coverage that is available for a premium equal to
the Premium Cap. 

   

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their officers or directors, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.5 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. 

  

 (f) This Section shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall expressly assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5. 

 

Section 6.6 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall obtain and deliver to
Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary designated by Parent to the Company in
writing at least fifteen (15) business days prior to the Closing. 

  

Section 6.7 _Conduct of Business of Parent and Merger Sub Pending
the Merger_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, it shall not, directly or indirectly,
take any action that would, or would reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. 

  

Section 6.8 _Financing_. 

   

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters (provided, that, Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, or otherwise so long as the terms would not adversely impact the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfy, on a timely basis, all conditions within its control applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth therein, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions related to the Debt Financing) or on other terms reasonably acceptable to Parent (to the extent no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided in the Debt Commitment Letters), and (iv) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment 

   ##### 

  

 

Letters, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient, when combined with the funds under the
Equity Commitment Letters, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent
in the aggregate (as determined in the good faith reasonable judgment of
Parent) than the Debt Financing (including the flex provisions related to the
Debt Financing) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event but in all cases at or prior to Closing. Parent shall give the Company
prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letters of
which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination of the Commitment
Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
and provide to the Company copies of executed copies of the definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Marketing Period" shall mean the first period of 20 consecutive business
days throughout which (1) Parent shall have the Required Financial
Information that the Company is required to provide to Parent pursuant to
Section 6.8(b)(iv) and (2) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 shall be
satisfied and nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause
any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3 to fail to be satisfied
assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such 20
consecutive business day period; provided, that the Marketing Period shall not
be deemed to have commenced if, prior to the completion of the Marketing
Period, KPMG LLP shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any
financial statements contained in the Company SEC Reports. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives, including legal and accounting advisors, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) assisting in the preparation for, and participating in, meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and similar presentations to and with, among others, prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda (including the delivery of one or more customary representation letters), prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing, (iii) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates, opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters (but only as they relate to the Company) and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral, (iv) furnishing Parent and its Financing sources with the financial statements and financial data of the Company required by (A) paragraph (d) of Exhibit D of the Senior Debt Commitment Letter and (B) paragraph (d) of Exhibit C of the Subordinated Debt Commitment Letter (in each case, within the time frames described therein) (the "Required Financial Information"), (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys, appraisals, environmental reports and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent, (vi) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Companys inventory, properties, current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto, and to assist the prospective lenders with field audits and collateral and asset examinations, in each case for the purpose of establishing collateral eligibility and values and (B) establish bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing, (vii) obtaining any necessary rating agencies confirmation or approvals for the Debt Financing, and (viii) taking all corporate actions 

   ##### 

  

 

necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the
proceeds thereof to be made available to the Company, including the entering
into one or more credit agreements or other instruments on terms satisfactory
to Parent in connection with the Debt Financing immediately prior to the
Effective Time to the extent direct borrowings or debt incurrence by the
Company is contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters; provided that none of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt
Financing prior to the Effective Time except for any liabilities that are
conditioned on the Effective Time having occurred. If this Agreement
is terminated prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
for and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of Debt Financing or any alternative financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection
therewith). The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its and the
Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing, provided
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries and its or their marks. 

  

Section 6.9 _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning
the Merger shall be a joint press release and, thereafter, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company will
disseminate any press release or other public announcement concerning the
Merger or this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to any third party, except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with the NASDAQ, without the prior consent of each of the
other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, however, that Parents consent will not be required, and
the Company need not consult with Parent, in connection with any press
release or public statement to be issued or made with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without prior consent of the other
parties, the Company (a) may communicate with customers, vendors, suppliers,
financial analysts, investors and media representatives in a manner
consistent with its past practice in compliance with applicable Law and (b)
may disseminate the information included in a press release or other document
previously approved for external distribution by Parent. 

  

Section 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party shall give prompt
notice to the other parties of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would reasonably be expected
to cause any representation or warranty made by such party in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at the Closing, or would
reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in Section 7 not
to be satisfied in any material respect at the Closing, and (ii) any failure
of such party or any of its representatives to comply with or satisfy in all
material respects any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; provided however that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or the remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

  

Section 6.11 _Agreements with Respect to Existing Debt_. On or prior to
the second business day prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall

delivery of funds as arranged by Parent and Merger Sub) in commercially
reasonable form, from Wachovia Bank, National Association as administrative
agent under that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated
as of October 7, 2005 by and among the Company and the Lenders party thereto
and shall make arrangements for the release of all mortgages, liens and
other security over the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries properties
and assets securing such obligations. 

  

Section 6.12 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and the members of their respective
Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose
breach in any material respect of its obligations under this Agreement has
been the proximate cause of such Restraint; 

   

 (d) By Parent (if neither it nor Merger Sub is in material breach of its representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.3 not to be satisfied) if there has been a breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach or inaccuracy would cause any condition set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.2 not to be satisfied (and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured or such condition has not been satisfied within twenty (20) business days after the receipt of written notice thereof or such breach or inaccuracy is not reasonably capable of being cured prior to the Termination Date or such condition is not reasonably capable of being satisfied prior to the Termination Date);

provisions of Section 8.2(e) and Section 8.2(f) hereof, shall relieve any
party hereto from liability arising out of the willful breach of this
Agreement or fraud, or as provided for in the Confidentiality Agreements, in
which 

     ##### 

  

    

case the aggrieved party shall, subject to Section 8.2(e) and Section 8.2(f)
hereof, be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law, and, subject

 (i) (A) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made directly to its shareholders or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known and (B) following the occurrence of an event described in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(h) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d) and (C) the Company enters into, or submits to the stockholders of the Company for adoption, a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or consummates any Acquisition Proposal, within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated, which in each case, need not be the same Acquisition Proposal that shall have been publicly announced or made known at or prior to termination of this Agreement (provided that for purposes of clause (C) of this Section 8.2(a), the references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"); or 

   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g); or 

   

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f);

below), less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent by
the Company (if any), by wire transfer of same day funds, it being understood
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. "Termination Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $40

order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Company Acquisition Proposal with an Excluded Party, or (y) in the event that
this Agreement is terminated prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(f) in a circumstance in which the event giving rise
to the right of termination is based on the submission of an Acquisition
Proposal by an Excluded Party, in which cases the Termination Fee shall mean
an amount equal to $20 million. 

   

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, pursuant to Section 8.1(h) (or is terminated by the Company pursuant to a different section of Section 8.1 at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 8.1(h)) under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to Section 8.2(a), then the Company shall pay as promptly as possible (but in any event within two Business Days after a request therefor) all of Parents and its Affiliates reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $7.5 million ("Parent Expenses") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Parent; provided, however, that the existence of 

   ##### 

  

 

circumstances which could require the Termination Fee to become subsequently
payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a) shall not relieve the
Company of its obligations to pay Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section
8.2(b); provided, further that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses
pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
8.2(a). 

   

 (c) In the event that: 

   

 (i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), or

then in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 8.2(c), Parent
shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $40 million in cash (the
"Parent Termination Fee"), it being understood that in no event shall Parent
be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 

   

 (d) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.2(a) shall be made at the direction of Parent, promptly following the earliest of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, submission to the stockholders of, or the consummation of, any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal (and in any event not later than two business days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 8.2(a) shall be made at the direction of Parent, concurrently with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g); any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 8.2(a) shall be made at the direction of Parent, promptly following termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) (and in any event not later than two business days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment), and such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent. Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 8.2(c) shall be made to the Company promptly following termination of this Agreement by the Company (and in any event not later than two business days after delivery to Parent of notice of demand for payment), and such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by the Company. 

  

 (e) In the event of a termination of this Agreement in connection with which the Company is entitled to receive the Parent Termination Fee, the Companys right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub and any of their respective current, former or future representatives, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, or stockholders (each, a "Parent Party") for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the breach of this Agreement or any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein by Parent or Merger Sub or the failure of the Merger to be consummated. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company agrees that to the extent it has incurred any losses or damages in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby ("Company Damages"), (i) the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub in the aggregate for all such Company Damages shall be limited to $40 million (the "Parent Liability Limitation"), inclusive of the Parent Termination Fee, (ii) the 

   ##### 

  

 

maximum liability of the Sponsors, directly or indirectly, shall be limited to
the express obligations of the Sponsors under their respective Limited
Guarantees, (iii) in no event shall the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
any of their Affiliates seek (and the Company shall cause its controlled
Affiliates not to seek) any (x) equitable relief or equitable remedies of any
kind whatsoever or (y) money damages or any other recovery, judgment, or
damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages
in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation, in each case against or from
Parent, Merger Sub or the Sponsors, and (iv) in no event shall any
other Parent Party have any liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates shall seek
(and the Company shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to seek) any
money damages or any other recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages against any other
Parent Party, and the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their Affiliates
shall be precluded from any remedy against any other Parent Party at law or
in equity or otherwise.

Any party may by notice given in accordance with this Section 9.3 to the other
parties designate another address or person for receipt of notices hereunder.
Rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver because of
changed address or facsimile of which no notice was given shall be deemed to
be receipt of the notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal or

Section 9.4 _Binding Effect; No Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. 

   

 (a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided, that Parent may assign this Agreement to any of its Affiliates without the consent of the Company; provided, further, that no such assignment will relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any party (including any assignor) hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 (b) Except for the provisions of Section 6.5 (which shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person other than Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and their respective successors and permitted assigns any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

 

Section 9.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or
degree shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid
or unenforceable. The parties further agree to negotiate in good faith to
replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement, or invalid
or unenforceable portion thereof, with a valid and enforceable provision that
will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision or portion thereof. 

  

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes
of action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, except to the extent the Laws of the State of
Tennessee are mandatorily applicable in connection with the Merger
provisions contained in Sections 1 and 2 hereof. 

  

Section 9.7 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
the courts of the State of Delaware (or, in the case of any claim as to which
the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal
court of the United States of America) sitting in New Castle County in the
State of Delaware in any action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, and hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such
action may be heard and determined in such court. Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other
than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, 

    ##### 

  

    

execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts. EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT
AND MERGER SUB WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS,
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. 

  

Section 9.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties recognize and agree that
if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed
by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which
money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees
that, in addition to other remedies, prior to any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
law or equity. In the event that any action shall be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of the Agreement, the Company shall not allege,
and hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at Law. The
parties further acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any such breach shall be the remedy available to the Company set forth in
Section 8.2. 

  

Section 9.9 _Interpretation_. 

   

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, subsection or clause, such reference shall be to a Section, subsection or clause of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. 

  

 (b) The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) This Agreement is the result of the joint efforts of Parent and the Company, and each provision hereof has been subject to the mutual consultation, negotiation and agreement of the parties and there shall be no construction against any party based on any presumption of that partys involvement in the drafting thereof. 

  

 (d) To the extent this Agreement refers to information or documents having been made available (or delivered or provided) to Parent, the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied such obligation if the Company or its Representatives made such information or document available on or prior to the date hereof (or delivered or provided such information or document on or prior to the date hereof), including through the Intralinks online dataroom, to any officer or partner of Parent or Sponsors or any of their respective Representatives. 

  

 (e) The term "affiliate" or "Affiliate" means a person that directly, or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the first-mentioned person. 

   #####

 (g) The words "include," "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." 

  

 (h) The term "knowledge" of the Company shall mean the actual knowledge of the officers of the Company listed on Section 9.10(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (i) The disclosure of any matter or item in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement that such matter or item is required to be disclosed therein or is a material exception to a representation, warranty, covenant or condition set forth in this Agreement and shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "materially," "materiality," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or any word or phrase of similar import and does not mean that such matter or item would, with any other matter or item, have or be reasonably expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Certain matters have been disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule for informational purposes only. 

  

 (j) The term "person" or "Person" shall mean any individual, corporation (including any non-profit corporation), general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, joint venture, estate, trust, company (including any limited liability company or joint stock company), firm or other enterprise, association, organization, entity or Governmental Entity. 

  

 (k) The term "subsidiary" or "Subsidiary, " with respect to any Person, means any other Person of which the first Person owns, directly or indirectly, securities or other ownership interests having voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar functions (or, if there are no such voting interests, more than 50% of the equity interests of the second Person). 

 

Section 9.10 _No Waiver of Rights_. No failure or delay on the part of
any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof
or of any other right. 

  

Section 9.11 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may
be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Facsimile signatures shall be acceptable and binding.
