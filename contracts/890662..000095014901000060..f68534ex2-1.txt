any action on the part of the holder thereof be converted automatically into the
right to receive a number of shares of Parent Class B Common Stock calculated in
accordance with the Exchange Ratio upon the surrender of the Certificate
representing such share in the manner set forth in Section 2.6. All such shares
of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a Certificate representing such shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive that number of shares of
Parent Class B Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock have
been converted, cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.6(c)
and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.7.

               (b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding

stock shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

               (c) Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Buyer issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and

Corporation.

Parent shall have declared a stock split (including a reverse split) of Parent
Class B Common Stock or a dividend payable in Parent Class B Common Stock or

                                      -11-

reclassification of its common stock or any other similar transaction, then the

dividend, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction.

        Section 2.5. Stock Options. At the Effective Date, each Company Stock
Option shall be assumed by the Parent in such manner that it is converted into
an option to purchase shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, as provided below.
Following the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the relevant
Company Stock Plan and applicable award agreement immediately prior to the
Effective Time; except that (i) each such Company Stock Option will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that
number of whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the product of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of Shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for Parent
Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option will be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of the
Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent.

        Section 2.6. Exchange of Certificates.

               (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall appoint the
Exchange Agent for the purpose of exchanging Certificates. At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing Parent Class B Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.4 in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Parent agrees to
make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6(c)
and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.7.

               (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent accompanied by a properly executed letter of transmittal and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Parent may
reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent
Class B Common Stock. Upon the surrender to the Exchange Agent of one or more
Certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder will be entitled to receive certificates representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Class B Common Stock to be issued in respect of
the aggregate number of such shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by the Certificates surrendered based upon the Exchange Ratio and
cash in an amount equal to that which the holder is entitled to receive

                                      -12-
<PAGE>   18


pursuant to Section 2.6(c) or Section 2.7. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on cash payable pursuant to Section 2.6(c) or 2.7.

               (c) No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Class B Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights as a stockholder of the Parent. All fractional
shares of Parent Class B Common Stock that a holder of Company Common Stock
would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be
aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder
shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the per share closing price of Parent Class B Common Stock
quoted on the NYSE on the date of the Closing by (ii) the fraction of a share of
Parent Class B Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled. The Parent shall timely make available to the Exchange Agent any cash
necessary to make payments in lieu of fractional shares as aforesaid. No such
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class B Common Stock shall be paid
to any holder of Company Common Stock until Certificates are surrendered and
exchanged in accordance with Section 2.6(a).

               (d) If a certificate for Parent Class B Common Stock is to be
sent to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates for shares
of Company Common Stock surrendered for exchange are registered, it shall be a
condition of the exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
delivery of such Certificate to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

               (e) The cash paid and shares of Parent Class B Common Stock
issued upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.

        Section 2.7. Dividends. No dividends or other distributions that are
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Class B Common
Stock payable to holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be
paid to a Company Stockholder entitled to receive certificates representing
Parent Class B Common Stock until such stockholder has properly surrendered such
stockholder's Certificates. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to the
stockholder in whose name the certificates representing such Parent Class B
Common Stock shall be issued any dividends which shall have become payable with
respect to such Parent Class B Common Stock between the Effective Time and the
time of such surrender, without interest. After such surrender, there shall also
be paid to the stockholder in whose name the certificates representing such
Parent Class B Common Stock shall be issued any dividend on such Parent Class B
Common Stock that shall have a record date subsequent to the Effective Time and
prior to such surrender and a payment date after such surrender; provided that
such dividend payments shall be made on such payment dates. In no event shall
the stockholder entitled to receive such dividends be entitled to receive
interest on such dividends.

Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Parent Class B Common Stock, any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto or any cash in lieu of fractional shares of applicable Parent
Class B Common Stock, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to six months after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Parent Class B Common Stock,
any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate or any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class B Common Stock
pursuant to this Article II, would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity), any such Parent Class B Common Stock, dividends or
distributions in respect thereof or such cash shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of
this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Parent for satisfaction of
their claims for such Parent Class B Common Stock, dividends or distributions in
respect thereof or such cash.

        Section 2.9. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Parent Class B Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.4
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and unpaid
dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Class B Common Stock deliverable
in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

        Section 2.10. Withholding Rights. The Surviving Corporation shall be

pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Stockholder such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Stockholder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation.

        Section 2.11. Shares held by the Company Affiliates. Anything to the
contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, no shares of Parent Class B Common
Stock (or certificates therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any certificate
to any Person who may be an "affiliate" of the Company (identified pursuant to
Section 6.16) until the Person shall have delivered to Parent and the Company a
duly executed letter as contemplated by Section 6.16.

        Section 2.12. Closing of Company Transfer Books. At the Effective Time,

except where failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has

equivalents or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments (contingent
or otherwise) of any character issued or authorized by the Company relating to
the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or obligating the Company to

will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as
set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares
of Company Stock or to pay any dividend or make any other distribution in
respect thereof or to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Person. As of the date hereof,
there are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the

aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has furnished or
made available to the Parent true and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or comparable organizational documents of each Subsidiary,
each as amended to date. Such organizational documents are in full force and
effect, and no Subsidiary is in violation of any provision therein.

                                      -17-
<PAGE>   23

               (b) Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company or its Subsidiaries own beneficially and of record all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock or other securities of each Subsidiary and does not
own an equity interest in any other corporation, partnership or entity, other

securities of each Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and each such share or other equity interest owned by the Company
or another Subsidiary is free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements, limitations on
the Company's or such other Subsidiary's voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

        Section 4.5. No Conflict. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the Company Option Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of
this Agreement and the Company Option Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the Merger (subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the

Company Option Agreement will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents of any of the Subsidiaries, (ii) subject to Section 4.6, conflict with
or violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is bound
or affected, or (iii) result in a breach of or constitute a default (or an event
which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, give
to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
result in triggering any payment or other obligations, or result in the creation
of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation
to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any property or asset of any of them is
bound or affected, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above for any
such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which could
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 4.6. Required Filings and Consents. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement
by the Company will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (i) for
applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or
state securities laws or "blue sky" laws and filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, (ii) for those required by
the HSR Act, (iii) where failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger
or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its
material obligations under this Agreement, and would not otherwise reasonably be
expected to have individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect and (iv) for those which have heretofore been obtained by the Company.

        Section 4.7. Compliance. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports
filed by the Company with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, the

<PAGE>   24

judgment, order, decree, writ, injunction, license or permit of any Governmental
Entity, except for violations which have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Company or any Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated to the Company or any
Subsidiary an intention to conduct the same in each case other than those the
outcome of which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 4.8. Litigation. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter, there is no claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending,
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or affecting the
Company or any Subsidiary which, either individually or in the aggregate, has

nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator, outstanding against the Company or any Subsidiary, either
individually or in the aggregate, which has had, or would be reasonably expected
to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 4.9. Company Reports; Financial Statements.

               (a) The Company has filed all Company Reports, each of which has
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in
effect on the date so filed. None of the Company Reports (including, but not
limited to, any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by
reference therein) contained when filed any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

               (b) All of the Company Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the
Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its
operations and changes in cash flows for the periods indicated except that the
unaudited interim financial statements are subject to normal recurring year-end
adjustments consistent with past practices and not material in amount.

               (c) There are no liabilities of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or not
contingent or absolute, that are material to the Company and the Subsidiaries,

consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries at May 31, 2000,
including the notes thereto, (ii) liabilities disclosed in the Company Reports,
(iii) liabilities incurred on behalf of the Company under this Agreement and the
contemplated Merger, and (iv) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since May 31, 2000, none of which in the
case of clause (iv) are, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>   25

               (d) The Company has heretofore furnished or made available to the
Parent a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which
have not yet been filed with the SEC, to agreements, documents or other
instruments which previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC as
exhibits to the Company Reports pursuant to the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

        Section 4.10. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except for any
Subsidiary liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, since May 31, 2000, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in the ordinary course or as
disclosed in any Company Reports, and there has not been (i) any change or event
having, or that would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any of the
Company's capital stock, (iii) any split, combination or reclassification of any
of the Company's capital stock or any substitution for shares of the Company's
capital stock, except for issuances of Company Common Stock upon the exercise of
options awarded prior to the date hereof in accordance with the Company Stock
Plans, (iv) except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (a) any
granting by the Company or any Subsidiary, to any current or former director,
executive officer or other key employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of any
increase in compensation, bonus or other benefits, except for increases in the
ordinary course of business or as was required under any employment agreements
in effect as of the date of the most recent audited financial statements
included in the Company Reports filed and publicly available prior to the date
of this Agreement which have been disclosed to Parent in the manner described in
Section 4.15, (b) any granting by the Company or any Subsidiary, to any such
current or former director, executive officer or key employee of any increase in

into, or any amendment of, any employment, deferred compensation, consulting,
severance, termination or indemnification agreement with any such current or
former director, executive officer or key employee, (v) except insofar as may
have been disclosed in the Company Reports or required by a change in GAAP, any
change in accounting methods, principles or practices by the Company or any
Subsidiary, materially affecting its assets, liabilities or business or (vi)
except insofar as may have been disclosed in the Company Reports, any tax
election that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 4.11. Taxes.

               (a) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has filed all
material Tax Returns that it was required to file. All such Tax Returns were
correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes owed by any of the
Company and the Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been
paid, except where the failure to pay such Taxes does not exceed, in the
aggregate, $250,000. None of the Company and the Subsidiaries currently is the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No
claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or
any Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to
taxation in that jurisdiction. There are no security

                                      -20-
<PAGE>   26

interests on any of the assets of any of the Company and the Subsidiaries that
arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax.

               (b) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has withheld and
paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
stockholder or other third party, except where the failure to pay such Taxes
does not exceed, in the aggregate, $50,000.

               (c) There is no audit, dispute or claim concerning any Tax
liability of any of the Company or the Subsidiaries either (i) claimed or raised
by any authority in writing or (ii) as to which any of the directors, officers
and employees responsible for Tax matters of the Company and the Subsidiaries
has knowledge based upon personal contact with any agent of such authority. The
Company Disclosure Letter lists all United States domestic income, franchise,
sales, use, business license, and personal property Tax Returns filed with
respect to any of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the current taxable
periods, indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited, and indicates those
Tax Returns that currently are the subject of audit. The Company and the
Subsidiaries have provided to the Parent access to correct and complete copies
of all income Tax Returns, examination reports, and statements of deficiencies
assessed against or agreed to by any of the Company and the Subsidiaries since
the taxable year ended May 31, 1998 with respect to federal and state income Tax
Returns, since the taxable year ended May 31, 1996 with respect to federal
income Tax notice of deficiencies, since the taxable year ended May 31, 1995
with respect to federal income Tax audit reports and since the taxable year
ended May 31, 1996 with respect to federal income Tax closing documents.

               (d) None of the Company and the Subsidiaries has waived any
statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency that remains in effect.

               (e) None of the Company and the Subsidiaries has filed a consent
under Section 341(f) of the Code concerning collapsible corporations. None of
the Company and the Subsidiaries has made any payments, is obligated to make any
payments, or is a party to any agreement that under certain circumstances could
obligate it to make any payments that will not be deductible under Sections 280G
and 162(m) of the Code. None of the Company and the Subsidiaries has been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has
disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns all information necessary to avoid
the imposition of a penalty for substantial understatement of federal income Tax
within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. None of the Company and the
Subsidiaries is a party to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement (other than
by and between the Company and the Subsidiaries). None of the Company and the
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated
federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was the
Company) or (B) has knowledge of any liability for the Taxes of any Person
(other than any of the Company and the Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

                                      -21-
<PAGE>   27


               (f) The Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the following
information with respect to each of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the
most recent practicable date: (i) the amount of any excess loss account; (ii)
the amount of any net operating loss, net capital loss, unused investment or
other credit, unused foreign tax, or excess charitable contribution allocable to
the Company or the Subsidiaries; and (iii) the amount of any deferred gain or
loss allocable to the Company or the Subsidiaries arising out of any deferred
intercompany transaction.

               (g) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries did not,
as of August 31, 2000, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance sheet (disregarding
any notes thereto) included in the Company's unaudited interim financial
statements as of and for the three months ended August 31, 2000 included in the
Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC.

        Section 4.12. Title to Personal Property. Except as set forth in the
10-K or in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and each of the
Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold interest
in, all of their tangible personal properties and assets reflected in the 10-K
or acquired after May 31, 2000 (other than assets disposed of since May 31, 2000
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), in each case
free and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges, security interests, charges,
claims, restrictions and encumbrances of any nature whatsoever, except for (i)
liens, encumbrances or restrictions which secure indebtedness and which are
properly reflected in the 10-K; (ii) liens for Taxes accrued but not yet
payable; (iii) liens arising as a matter of law in the ordinary course of
business with respect to obligations incurred after May 31, 2000, provided that
the obligations secured by such liens are not delinquent; and (iv) such other
liens, encumbrances and restrictions, if any, as individually or in the
aggregate are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and the Subsidiaries either own, or have valid leasehold interests
in, all tangible personal properties and assets used by them in the conduct of
their business, except where the absence of such ownership or leasehold interest
could not individually or in the aggregate have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has on hand the items of
Customer Inventory it is required to have on hand pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the applicable agreement between the Company and its customers
subject to immaterial shrinkage. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries
has any legal obligation, absolute or contingent, to any other Person to sell or
otherwise dispose of any of its tangible personal properties or assets with an
individual value of $500,000 or an aggregate value in excess of $1,000,000.

        Section 4.13. Real Property. Except as set forth in the 10-K or in the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and the Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of their real
properties reflected in the 10-K or acquired after May 31, 2000, in each case
free and clear of all title defects, liens, encumbrances and restrictions,
except for (i) liens, encumbrances or restrictions which secure indebtedness and
which are properly reflected in the 10-K; (ii) liens for Taxes accrued but not
yet payable; (iii) liens arising as a matter of law in the ordinary course of
business with respect to obligations incurred after May 31, 2000, provided that
the obligations secured by such liens are not delinquent; and (iv) such

                                      -22-
<PAGE>   28

other title defects, liens, encumbrances and restrictions, if any, as
individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all real property owned by the Company or a
Subsidiary at any time during the past three years and a true and correct list
of all real property leased by each of the Company and the Subsidiaries
identifying with respect to each lease of such real property the date of, the
parties to, and any amendments, modifications, extensions or other supplements
to such lease. Each of the real properties owned by the Company or any
Subsidiary as of the date hereof or leased by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and in either case listed in the Company Disclosure Letter, and
each building and improvement located thereon, is, and has at all times been, in
compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules,
regulations, ordinances and statutes, including those relating to zoning,
building, land use, health and safety, fire, air sanitation and noise control
except as would not have a material impact on the Company's ability to maintain
its operations at such real property. The improvements on the real properties
owned by the Company as of the date hereof or leased by the Company and in
either case listed in the Company Disclosure Letter are adequate and suitable
for the purposes for which they are presently being used. Since January 1, 2000,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has sent or received any written notice
of any material default under any of the leases of real property to which it is
party. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has breached or is in default in
any material respect under any covenant, agreement, term or condition of or
contained in any material lease of real property to which it is a party and
there has not occurred any event that with the lapse of time or the giving of
notice or both would constitute such a default or breach.

        Section 4.14. Environmental Compliance and Disclosure. Except as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter,

               (a) each of the Company and the Subsidiaries possesses, and is in
compliance in all material respects with, all material permits, licenses and
government authorizations and has filed all notices that are required under
Environmental Laws applicable to the Company and the Subsidiaries, and each of
the Company and the Subsidiaries is in material compliance with all applicable
limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards, prohibitions, requirements,
obligations, schedules and timetables contained in those laws or contained in
any Law, regulation, code, plan, order, decree, judgment, notice, permit or
demand letter issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder;

               (b) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received notice of
actual or threatened liability under CERCLA or any similar state or local
statute or ordinance from any governmental agency or any third party and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances which could
reasonably be expected to form the basis for the assertion of any claim against
the Company or any Subsidiary under any Environmental Laws including CERCLA or
any similar local, state or foreign Law with respect to any on-site or off-site
location;

               (c) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has entered into or
agreed to, or does it contemplate entering into any consent decree or order, and
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to any judgment, decree or
judicial or administrative order relating to

                                      -23-
<PAGE>   29

compliance with, or the cleanup of Hazardous Materials under, any applicable
Environmental Laws;

               (d) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been subject to
any administrative or judicial proceeding pursuant to and, to the knowledge of
the Company, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been alleged to be in
violation of applicable Environmental Laws or regulations either now or any time
during the past five years;

               (e) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received notice
that it is subject to any claim, obligation, liability, loss, damage or expense
of whatever kind or nature, contingent or otherwise, incurred or imposed or
based upon any provision of any Environmental Law and arising out of any act or
omission of the Company or any Subsidiary, its employees, agents or
representatives or, to the knowledge of the Company, arising out of the
ownership, use, control or operation by the Company or any Subsidiary of any
plant, facility, site, area or property (including any plant, facility, site,
area or property currently or previously owned or leased by the Company or any
Subsidiary) from which any Hazardous Materials were released into the
environment (the term "release" meaning any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring,
emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping or
disposing into the environment, and the term "environment" meaning any surface
or ground water, drinking water supply, soil, surface or subsurface strata or
medium, or the ambient air);

               (f) the Company has heretofore provided the Parent with true,
correct and complete copies of all files of the Company and the Subsidiaries
relating to environmental matters (or an opportunity to review such files) that
have arisen in the last five years;

               (g) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has paid any fines,

Agreement or otherwise.

        Section 4.16. Employee Benefit Plans.

               (a) The Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete
list of each Company Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the
Company or any Subsidiary within the last six calendar years. Each Company
Benefit Plan currently in effect is identified as a "current plan" on the
Company Disclosure Letter and any special tax status enjoyed by such plan is
noted on the Company Disclosure Letter.

               (b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan identified on the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has heretofore delivered or made
available to the Parent true and complete copies of (i) the plan documents and
any amendments thereto (or if the plan is not written, a written description
thereof), (ii) any related trust or other funding vehicle, (iii) annual reports
required to be filed with any Governmental Entity with respect to such plan,
(iv) actuarial reports, (v) funding and financial information returns and
statements, (vi) all contracts with any parties providing services or insurance
to such plan, (vii) copies of material correspondence with all Governmental
Entities, (viii) plan summaries or summary plan descriptions, (ix) summary
annual reports, (x) booklets and personnel manuals, (xi) any other reports or
summaries required under Applicable Benefit Laws, each of the documents
described in (i) through (xi) only to the extent effective in or with respect to
the last six years of the date hereof, (xii) the most recent determination
letter received from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each such plan
intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code, and (xiii) such other
documentation with respect to any Company Benefit Plan as is reasonably
requested by the Parent, including all professional opinions (whether or nor
internally prepared) and all material internal memoranda regarding any
compliance issues identified by Parent.

               (c) The Company and the Subsidiaries have maintained all employee
data necessary to administer each Company Benefit Plan, including data required
to be maintained under Sections 107 and 209 of ERISA, and such data is true and
correct and is maintained in a usable form.

               (d) No Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan is or was
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor is any Company
Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan a "multiemployer pension plan", as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or subject

                                      -25-
<PAGE>   31

to Section 302 of ERISA. Neither the Company, any Subsidiary, an ERISA Affiliate
nor a predecessor in interest of any of them has or has had an obligation to
make contributions or reimburse another employer, either directly or indirectly,
including through indemnification or otherwise, for making contributions to a
plan that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has incurred, and no facts exist which reasonably could be expected
to result in, liability to the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of a
termination, withdrawal or funding waiver with respect to any ERISA Affiliate
Plan or Company Benefit Plan.

               (e) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, registered,
qualified, invested, operated and administered in all respects in accordance
with its terms in compliance with all Applicable Benefit Laws and in accordance
with all understandings, written or oral, between the Company and each
Subsidiary and their respective current or former employees, directors,
officers, consultants, independent contractors, contingent workers or leased
employees, as applicable. None of the Company and the Subsidiaries has incurred,
and no facts exist which reasonably could be expected to result in any liability
to the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or any
ERISA Affiliate Plan, including any liability, tax, penalty or fee under ERISA,
the Code or any Applicable Benefit Law (other than to pay premiums,
contributions or benefits in the ordinary course).

               (f) All obligations to pay premiums, contributions or benefits
under each Company Benefit Plan have been satisfied, and there are no
outstanding defaults or violations by any party to any Company Benefit Plan. No
taxes, penalties or fees are owed by any Company Benefit Plan.

               (g) No fact or circumstance exists that could adversely affect
the tax-exempt status of a Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be
tax-exempt. Further, each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and the trusts maintained thereunder
that are intended to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination or other letter indicating that it is so
qualified, or is otherwise within the remedial amendment period under Section
401(b) of the Code and revenue rulings, procedures, announcements or notices of
the Internal Revenue Service.

               (h) The assets of each Company Benefit Plan are reported at their
fair market value on the financial statements of each such plan.

               (i) No Company Benefit Plan provides medical, surgical,
hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for current
or former employees, directors, officers, consultants, independent contractors,
contingent workers or leased employees (or any of their dependents, spouses or
beneficiaries) of the Company or any Subsidiary or any predecessor in interest
of such Company or Subsidiary for periods extending beyond their retirement or
other termination of service, other than continuation coverage mandated by any
Applicable Benefit Law and only to the extent required under such law.

                                      -26-
<PAGE>   32

               (j) All contributions or premiums required to be made by the
Company or any Subsidiary under the terms of each Company Benefit Plan or by
Applicable Benefit Laws have been made in a timely fashion in accordance with
Applicable Benefit Laws and the terms of the Company Benefit Plan. Contributions
or premiums will be paid by the Company or a Subsidiary for the period up to the
Closing even though not otherwise required to be made until a later date.

               (k) No insurance policy or any other contract or agreement
affecting any Company Benefit Plan requires or permits a retroactive increase in
premiums or payments due thereunder.

               (l) There have been no improper withdrawals, applications or
transfers of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or the trusts or other funding
media relating thereto, and neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any of their
agents has been in breach of any fiduciary obligation with respect to the
administration of any Company Benefit Plan or the trusts or other funding media
relating thereto.

               (m) The Company or a Subsidiary has the right under the terms of
each Company Benefit Plan and under Applicable Benefit Law to amend, revise,
merge or terminate such plan (or its participation in such plan) or transfer the
assets of such plan to another arrangement, plan or fund at any time exclusively
by action of the Company or such Subsidiary, and no additional contributions
would be required to properly effect such termination.

               (n) Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, the
execution, delivery and performance of, and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement will not (i) entitle any current or former
employee, director, officer, consultant, independent contractors, contingent
worker or leased employee (or any of their dependents, spouses or beneficiaries)
of the Company or any Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or
any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or (iii)
increase the amount of compensation due any such individual.

               (o) None of the Company and the Subsidiaries has made any
payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any agreement that
under certain circumstances could obligate the Company or any Subsidiary to make
any payments that will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes by
reason of Section 280G of the Code.

               (p) There are no pending, anticipated or to knowledge of the
Company, threatened claims, investigations, examinations, audits or other
proceedings or actions against or involving any Company Benefit Plan, by any
current or former employee, director, officer, consultant, independent
contractors, contingent worker or leased employee (or any of their dependents,
spouses or beneficiaries) of the Company or any Subsidiary or any predecessor in
interest covered under such Company Benefit Plan, by any Governmental Entities
or otherwise involving any such Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims
for benefits) and to the knowledge of the Company after due inquiry, there
exists no state of facts which after notice or lapse of time or both reasonably
could be expected to give rise to any such claim, investigation,

                                      -27-

examination, audit or other proceeding or to affect the registration of any
Company Benefit Plan required to be registered.

        Section 6.2. Access to Information; Confidentiality.

        (a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Representatives of the Company to, afford the Representatives of
the Parent and the Buyer, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access at all
reasonable times to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and
other facilities, books and records, including Tax Returns of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, and shall furnish the Parent and the Buyer with all financial,
operating and other data and information as the Parent or the Buyer, through its


                                      -41-
<PAGE>   47

Representatives, may reasonably request. The Parent will remain subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

               (b) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall affect
any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

               (c) The Company shall cooperate in Parent's determination and
calculation of Subsidiaries' tax basis.

        Section 6.3. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give
prompt notice to the Parent, and the Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of (i) the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of any event which would be
likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate and (ii) any failure by such party (or the Buyer, in the
case of the Parent) to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice. If any event or matter arises after the date of this Agreement which, if
existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure Letter or which is necessary
to correct any information in the Company Disclosure Letter which has been
rendered inaccurate thereby, then the Company shall promptly supplement, or
amend, and deliver to the Parent the Company Disclosure Letter which it has
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

        Section 6.4. Company Stockholders' Meeting. The Company shall, as
promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders' Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining the Required Vote with respect to the Merger and this Agreement, shall
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the approval of this Agreement by the
Required Vote (regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the Company
modifies its recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement) and, subject to
Section 6.5, the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend the approval
of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing but subject to its rights pursuant to Sections 6.5 and 8.1(e),
the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 6.4 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal.

        Section 6.5. Board Recommendations.

               (a) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, or propose publicly to withdraw, in a
manner adverse to the Parent, the approval or recommendation of such Board of
Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) subject to
Section 6.5(b), modify, or propose publicly to modify in a manner adverse to the
Parent, the approval or recommendation of such Board of Directors or such
committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (iii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv)
approve or recommend or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter
into any Acquisition Agreement related to any


                                      -42-
<PAGE>   48

Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the date that
is the earlier of the 60th day following the date of execution of this Agreement
and the date of the Stockholders' Meeting, in response to a Superior Proposal
that did not result from a breach of Section 6.9, the Board of Directors of the
Company, in exercise of its fiduciary duties, reasonably determines in good
faith, based upon the written advice of independent outside legal counsel, that
the Board of Directors of the Company is required to do so to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, after providing the Parent with at least 72 hours
advance written notice of its decision to take such action, modify or propose
publicly to modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent, the approval or
recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement by the Board of Directors of the
Company.

               (b) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 or any other provision
hereof shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from
(A) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act a position with respect to a tender
or exchange offer by a third party, which is consistent with its obligations
hereunder or (B) making such disclosure to the Company Stockholders as, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after
receiving advice from independent outside legal counsel, is consistent with its
obligations hereunder and is required by applicable law; provided, that the
Company may not, except as provided by this Section 6.5, modify, or propose
publicly to modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent, the approval or
recommendation of such Board of Directors of the Merger or this Agreement or
approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal.

        Section 6.6. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give the Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
Litigation against the Company and its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger; provided, however, that no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the Parent's consent, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld; and, provided, further, that to the extent Parent
seeks Company's cooperation in the defense or settlement of such Litigation,
Parent shall enter into an appropriate joint defense agreement with the Company.

        Section 6.7. Indemnification.

               (a) It is understood and agreed that all rights to
indemnification by the Company now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties
shall survive the Merger and the Parent shall (i) cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue in full force and effect for a period of at least six
years from the Effective Time and (ii) perform, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to perform, in a timely manner, the Surviving Corporation's
obligation with respect thereto. The Parent and the Buyer agree that any claims
for indemnification hereunder as to which they have received written notice
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive, whether or
not such claims shall have been finally adjudicated or settled.

               (b) The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective
Time, if available, the D&O Insurance (provided that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of at least the

                                      -43-
<PAGE>   49

same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less
favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required
to expend pursuant to this Section 6.7(b) more than an amount per year equal to
two hundred percent (200%) of current annual premiums paid by the Company for
such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend more
than two hundred percent (200%) of current annual premiums, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by
payment of annual premiums equal to two hundred percent (200%) of current annual
premiums. If the Surviving Corporation elects to reduce the amount of insurance
coverage pursuant to the preceding sentence, it will furnish to the officers and
directors currently covered by such D&O Insurance reasonable notice of such
reduction in coverage and shall, to the extent additional coverage is available,
afford such Persons the opportunity to pay such additional premiums as may be
necessary to maintain the existing level of D&O Insurance coverage. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and perform the obligations of the
Company with respect to rights of indemnification existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties pursuant to indemnification agreements and employment
agreements with the Company's directors and officers existing on or before the
Effective Time and which are set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule.

               (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

               (d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
unconditionally guarantee the timely performance of all obligations of the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.7.

               (e) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives.

        Section 6.8. Public Announcements. The Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange or trading system to which the Parent or the
Company is a party.

        Section 6.9. Acquisition Proposals. The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of the Subsidiaries or Representatives of the Company
to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (a) solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information) or otherwise take any
action to facilitate, the making of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations

                                      -44-
<PAGE>   50

regarding, any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to
the date that is the earlier of the 60th day following the date of execution of
this Agreement and the date of the Stockholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors
of the Company, in exercise of its fiduciary duties, reasonably determines in
good faith, based upon the written advice of independent outside legal counsel,
that the Board of Directors of the Company is required to do so to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, the Board
of Directors of the Company and its Representatives may, in response to a
Superior Proposal that did not result in a breach of this Section 6.9, and
subject to providing contemporaneous notice of its decision to take such action
to the Parent, (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Subsidiaries to any Person making a Superior Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Superior Proposal. The Company shall provide immediate oral and
written notice to the Parent of (a) the receipt of any such Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, (b) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and (c) the identity of such Person or entity making any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall continue to keep the Parent
informed of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry,
as well as any related discussions or negotiations permitted under this Section
6.9.

        Section 6.10. Proxy Statement/Prospectus. As promptly as practicable
following the date hereof, the Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and
file with the SEC preliminary proxy materials and any amendments or supplements
thereof which shall constitute the proxy statement/prospectus (such proxy
statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy
Statement/Prospectus") and the Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Form S-4 and take any action required to be taken under applicable state
securities laws with respect to the issuance of Parent Class B Common Stock in
the Merger in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a
prospectus. The Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act. Each of the Parent and the Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after filing it with the SEC and to keep the Form
S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. The Parties
shall promptly provide copies, consult with each other and prepare written
responses with respect to any written comments received from the SEC with
respect to the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and promptly advise
the other party of any oral comments received from the SEC. The Parent agrees
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Parent for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the
time of the Stockholders' Meeting, will contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Company agrees that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment
or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the
Stockholders' Meeting, will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements

                                      -45-
<PAGE>   51

therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. For purposes of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that information concerning or related to the Parent will be deemed to have been
supplied by the Parent and information concerning or related to the Company and
the Stockholders' Meeting shall be deemed to have been supplied by the Company.

        Section 6.11. Further Assurances.

               (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
party hereto will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the
date hereof and (ii) obtain and maintain all approvals, consents, waivers,
registrations, permits, authorizations, clearances and other confirmations
required to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity that
are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (each a "Necessary Approval"). In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make as promptly as
practicable, to the extent it has not already done so, (i) an appropriate filing
of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (which filing shall be made in any event within
five Business Days of the date hereof), and (ii) all necessary filings with
other Governmental Entities relating to the Merger, and, in each case, to supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the such laws and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act and the receipt of Necessary Approvals under
such other laws as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Section 6.11 shall require, or be deemed to require, the Parent to agree
to or effect any divestiture (including divestitures of assets of the Parent or
the Company) or take any other action which would reasonably be expected to
impair the Parent's ability to achieve in any material respect the overall
benefits expected, as of the date hereof, to be realized from the consummation
of the Merger.

               (b) Each of the Parent and the Company shall, in connection with
the efforts referenced in Section 6.11(a) to obtain all Necessary Approvals, use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private
party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication received by
such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC or any other Governmental
Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review any
communications given by it to the FTC or any such other Governmental Entity or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person.

               (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in Sections 6.11(a) and 6.11(b), if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted)


                                      -46-
<PAGE>   52

challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined), or if any statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order is enacted, entered,
promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity which would make the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prohibit or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of the Parent and the Company shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and use its respective commercially reasonable efforts
to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other action or
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to have such statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order repealed, rescinded
or made inapplicable. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required
under the terms of this Agreement to dispose of or hold separate all or any
portion of the businesses or assets of the Parent or any of its subsidiaries or
of the Company or any Subsidiary in order to remedy or otherwise address the
concerns (whether or not formally expressed) of any Governmental Entity under
the HSR Act or any other antitrust statute or regulation.

               (d) In connection with, and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall (i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no antitakeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes operative with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger, the Option Agreements or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any antitakeover statute or similar
statute or regulation of any jurisdiction is or becomes operative with respect
to this Agreement, the Merger, the Option Agreements or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, take all actions necessary to ensure that this
Agreement, the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Option Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Option Agreements and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

               (e) Each party hereto agrees to consider efficient integration of
business operations. Each party hereto further agrees to cooperate with each
other in connection with efficiently integrating the business operations.

        Section 6.12. NYSE Listing. The Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance, a sufficient number of shares of Parent Class B Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger.

        Section 6.13. Tax Treatment.

               (a) Each of the Parent and the Company and their respective
subsidiaries shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and to
obtain the opinion of counsel referred to in Section 7.1(f), including the
execution of the letters of representation containing representations that are
customarily given in similar merger transactions, updated as necessary. The
Company

                                      -47-
<PAGE>   53

and the Parent (and their subsidiaries) shall treat the Parent Class B Common
Stock received in the Merger by Company Stockholders as property permitted to be
received by Section 354 of the Code without the recognition of gain. Each of the
Company and the Parent covenants and agrees to, and agrees to cause its
affiliates to, vigorously and in good faith defend all challenges to the
treatment of the reorganization as described in this Section 6.13. Each of the
Company and the Parent agrees that if it becomes aware of any such fact or
circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as
a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code, it will promptly
notify the other party in writing.

               (b) The Parent, in its sole discretion, may make an election
under Section 338 of the Code, in which case the Company will cooperate in
facilitating such election, and shall grant all consents, waivers and
authorizations necessary to effect such election by the Parent.

               (c) The Company and the Subsidiaries will not waive any statute
of limitations in respect of Taxes or agree to any extension of time beyond 90
days with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency without the consent of the
Parent.

nominated by the Parent to fill such vacancies.

        Section 6.16. Company Affiliates. The Company shall deliver to the
Parent a letter identifying all Persons who are, at the time the Merger is
submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, Affiliates of the
Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Person who is identified as a
possible Affiliate in such letter to deliver to the Parent on or prior to the
Effective Time an Affiliate Letter. The Parent shall be entitled to place
legends on any certificates of Parent Class B Common Stock issued to such
possible Affiliates to restrict transfer of such shares.

        Section 6.17. Purchase of Company Stock. The Company shall in no way
prohibit the Parent or any of its affiliates from purchasing shares of Company
Stock or entering into option, lock-up, voting or proxy agreements or any other
similar agreements with respect to Company Stock at any time prior to the
consummation of the Merger.

        Section 6.18. Rights Plan. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to 5:00 p.m., California
time, on the third Business Day following the date hereof, adopt the Rights Plan

defined in the Rights Plan) if they become the "Beneficial Owner" (as such term
is defined in the Rights Plan) of at least 15% of Company

the Parent nor the Buyer will become an Acquiring Person as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein or in the Option Agreements
or the Merger, (ii) no "Stock Acquisition Date" or "Distribution Date" (as such
terms are defined in the Rights Plan) will occur as a result of this Agreement,
the Option Agreements or the Merger or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein or in the Option Agreements and (iii) all outstanding rights
to purchase issued and outstanding Company Common Stock under the Rights Plan
will expire at the Effective Time.

        Section 6.19. Employee Matters.

               (a) The Company shall (i) take all commercially reasonably
actions necessary to correct any compliance deficiencies identified to the
Company by the Parent with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan in a

satisfactory to the Parent of such corrections; (ii) take all appropriate
corporate action to cease, effective upon Closing, all benefit accruals under

practicable after the date hereof (and in any event, for individuals employed in
the United States within 30 days hereof and for all other individuals within 45
days hereof) a true and complete list of all of the (a) officers, (b) employees
(whether full-time, part-time or otherwise) and (c) consultants or independent

social security number, home address, work location, length of service, hours of
service, tax withholding history for the current calendar year, other amounts
paid, benefits provided and any other information reasonably requested by the
Parent, together with an appropriate notation next to the name of any officer or
other employee on such list who is subject to any written employment agreement
or any other written term sheet or other document describing the terms and/or
conditions of employment of such employee or of the rendering of services by
such consultant or independent contractor and any other information reasonably
requested by the Parent.

               (c) The Parent and the Company shall take such action as is

provisions of Section 2.5 hereof.

               (d) The Parent shall (i) provide those employees of the Company

substantially similar and not substantially less favorable in the aggregate to

               (f) The Company will provide to the Parent as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (and in any event within 14 days hereof) a
true and complete list of any information that would have been disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter if the representations in Section 4.17 (h), (i), (k),
(l) and (o) had been drafted so as to request information with respect to any
matter that "has been filed or is pending or threatened" within the United

and subject to such reasonable limitations as the Company shall deem reasonable
and necessary, the Company shall permit, and shall cause each Subsidiary to
permit, the Parent to discuss and meet, and shall cooperate in such discussions

action vacated;

                                      -53-
<PAGE>   59

               (c) By any of the Parent, the Buyer or the Company if the Merger
shall not have been consummated on or before November 30, 2001; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure
to consummate the Merger on or before such date;

               (d) By the Parent if the Board of Directors of the Company takes
any of the actions set forth in the second sentence of Section 6.5(a);

               (e) By any of the Company, the Parent or the Buyer, if the
approval of the Company Stockholders required for consummation of the Merger
shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the Required
Vote at the Stockholders' Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

               (f) By the Parent or the Buyer, if (i) any of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.2 shall have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not
have been waived by the Parent and the Buyer, (ii) the Company shall breach in
any material respect any of its covenants or other obligations hereunder or
(iii) the Company shall breach (A) the representations or warranties hereunder
that are qualified by Company Material Adverse Effect or (B) the representations
and warranties hereunder that are not qualified by Company Material Adverse
Effect where, for purposes of this clause (B), such breach, individually or in
the aggregate, has a Company Material Adverse Effect. The foregoing
notwithstanding, if in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii), the breach giving rise
to the right of termination is capable of being cured, neither Parent nor Buyer
shall exercise its right of termination with respect to such breach unless
within ten days after written notice of such breach to the Company from the
Parent, such breach shall not have been cured in all material respects or waived
by the Parent or the Buyer and the Company shall not have provided reasonable
assurance to the Parent and the Buyer that such breach will be cured in all
material respects on or before the Effective Time; or

               (g) By the Company, if (i) any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.3 shall have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been
waived by the Company, (ii) the Parent or the Buyer shall breach in any material
respect any of its covenants or other obligations hereunder or (iii) the Parent
or the Buyer shall breach (A) the representations or warranties hereunder that
are qualified by Parent Material Adverse Effect or (B) the representations and
warranties hereunder that are not qualified by Parent Material Adverse Effect
where, for purposes of this clause (B), such breach, individually or in the
aggregate, has a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The foregoing notwithstanding,
if in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii), the breach giving rise to the right of
termination is capable of being cured, the Company shall not exercise its right
of termination with respect to such breach unless within ten days after written
notice of such breach to the Parent from the Company, such breach shall not have
been cured in all material respects or waived by the Company and the Parent or
the Buyer, as the case may be, shall not have provided reasonable assurance to
the Company that such breach will be cured in all material respects on or before
the Effective Time.

        Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1 shall not be available to any
party that (i) is in material breach

                                      -54-
<PAGE>   60

of its obligations hereunder or (ii) whose failure to fulfill its obligations or
to comply with its covenants under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of either
party hereunder.

        Section 8.2. Effect of Termination.

               (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith be terminated and have no
further effect except as specifically provided herein and in Section 9.10 and,
except as provided in this Section 8.2 and in Section 9.11, there shall be no
liability on the part of any party hereto, provided that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof.

               (b) If the Parent exercises its right to terminate this Agreement
under Section 8.1(d), the Company shall pay to the Parent the Termination Fee,
payable in same-day funds, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty to
reimburse the Parent for its time, expense and lost opportunity costs of
pursuing the Merger, upon entering into any agreement relating to such
Acquisition Proposal.

               (c) If within nine months after termination of this Agreement,
the Company shall enter into any agreement relating to, or consummate, an
Acquisition Proposal with a Person other than the Parent or the Buyer, then
immediately upon entering into such agreement, the Company shall pay to the
Parent upon demand the Termination Fee, payable in same-day funds, as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty, to reimburse the Parent for its time, expense and
lost opportunity costs of pursuing the Merger; provided that no such amount
shall be payable if the Termination Fee shall have become payable or have been
paid in accordance with Section 8.2(b) of this Agreement or if this Agreement
shall have been terminated by the Company in accordance with clause (ii) of
Section 8.1(g).

               (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, if the Company fails promptly to pay to the Parent any amounts due
under this Section 8.2, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including the
filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together
with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee or obligation at the publicly
announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to time from the date
such fee or obligation was required to be paid.

        Section 8.3. Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended except by
action taken or authorized by the board of directors of each of the parties
hereto set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto; provided, however, that after approval of the Merger by the
Company Stockholders, no amendment may be made without the further approval of
the Company Stockholders if such further approval is required by Law or the
rules of any relevant stock exchange or other trading system.

        Section 8.4. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the Stockholders' Meeting, any party hereto, by action taken by
its board of directors, may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of
the covenants, obligations or other acts of any

                                      -55-
<PAGE>   61

other party hereto or (ii) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or
warranties or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions of
any other party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its
duly authorized officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect to particular
facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any
other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing
right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

        Section 9.1. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Other than the provisions of
Sections 6.7 hereof, nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights or
remedies upon any Person other than the parties hereto.

        Section 9.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire Agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties, written or oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

        Section 9.3. Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and their respective
successors. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other parties; provided, however, that the Buyer may freely assign its rights to
another wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent without such prior written
approval but no such assignment shall relieve the Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder.

        Section 9.4. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

        Section 9.5. Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement
are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

        Section 9.6. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to principles of conflicts of law thereof.

        Section 9.7. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or


                                      -56-
<PAGE>   62

unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement
shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within
which the judgment may be appealed.

        Section 9.8. Specific Performance. Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that
the other party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in
any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the
parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled, at law or in equity.

        Section 9.9. Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

        Section 9.10. Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties and
Agreements. The representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement
shall terminate at the Effective Time or upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1, as the case may be, except that (i) the agreements set
forth in Articles II and IX and Sections 6.11, 6.6 and 6.7 shall survive the
Effective Time and (ii) the agreements set forth in Sections 6.6 and 8.2 and in
Article IX shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

        Section 9.11. Fees and Expenses. Subject to Sections 8.2(b), (c) and
(d), each party hereto shall pay its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except
that costs and expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and
mailing of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including SEC filing
fees) and the filing fees for the premerger notification and report forms under
the HSR Act shall be shared equally by the Parent and the Company.

        Section 9.12. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in Person, by UPS Next
Day Air or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt
requested) to the respective parties at the following addresses, or at such
other address for a party as shall be specified in a notice given in accordance
