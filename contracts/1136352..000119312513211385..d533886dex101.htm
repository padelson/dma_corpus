Section 3.4. In addition, to the extent applicable, the Holders of MLP Units
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have continued rights to any
distribution, without interest, with respect to such MLP Units with a record
date occurring prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made
by MLP on such MLP Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
which remains unpaid at the Effective Time. Such distributions by MLP are not
part of the Applicable Merger Consideration, and shall be paid on the payment
date set therefor to such Holders of MLP Units whether or not they exchange
their Certificates pursuant to Section 3.4. At the close of business on the
Closing Date, the unit transfer books of MLP shall be closed and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the unit transfer books of
MLP with respect to the MLP Units.

SECTION 3.3 Anti-Dilution Provisions. If between the Execution Date and the
Effective Time, whether or not permitted pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the outstanding MLP Units or Buyer Common Units shall be changed
into a different number of units or other securities by reason of any split,
reclassification, recapitalization, combination, merger, consolidation,
reorganization or other similar transaction or event, or any distribution
payable in equity securities shall be declared thereon with a record date
within such period (other than distributions in kind to the Holders of MLP
Class D Units or the holders of the MLP Incentive Distribution Rights pursuant
to the MLP Partnership Agreement), the Applicable Merger Consideration (and
the number of New Buyer Common Units issuable in the Merger), and the form of
securities issuable in the Merger shall be appropriately adjusted to provide
the Holders of MLP Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

 

SECTION 3.4 Exchange of Certificates.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Buyer shall appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC or a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to MLP to act as
exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the
Applicable Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or before the
Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of
the Holders of MLP Units for exchange in accordance with this Article III,
through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing New Buyer Common Units
and an amount of cash sufficient to effect the delivery of the Cash
Consideration less the CW Holdings Cash Payment Amount. Before the Effective
Time, CW Holdings shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of
the Holders of MLP Units (other than the CW Holders) for exchange in
accordance with this Article III,

 



18  through the Exchange Agent, the CW Holdings Cash Payment Amount. Buyer
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed,
cash sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to Section 3.2 and Section
3.4(c) and to make Fractional Unit Payments pursuant to Section 3.4(e), in
each case without interest. Any cash and certificates representing New Buyer
Common Units deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Applicable Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for the MLP Units pursuant to this Agreement out of
the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 3.4(c) and Section
3.4(e), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), Buyer shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of MLP Units as of the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
(which shall specify that in respect of certificated MLP Units, delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which
shall have such other provisions as may be necessary for the Holders of MLP
Units to be admitted as Additional Limited Partners in Buyer and which shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Buyer General Partner and
MLP General Partner may reasonably specify) and instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect therefor. Promptly after the Effective
Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any, for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, each holder who held MLP Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be entitled to receive upon surrender of the
Certificates therefor (i) certificates for New Buyer Common Units
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of New Buyer Common Units
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III
(after taking into account all MLP Units then held by such holder) and (ii) a
check in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to this Article III, including the Cash
Consideration, any Fractional Unit Payments pursuant to Section 3.4(e) and
distributions pursuant to Section 3.4(c). No interest shall be paid or accrued
on any Applicable Merger Consideration or any distributions payable pursuant
to Section 3.4(c). In the event of a transfer of ownership of MLP Common
Units that is not registered in the transfer records of MLP, the Applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such MLP Common Units may be paid
to a transferee, if the Certificate representing such MLP Common Units is
presented to the Exchange Agent, and in the case of both certificated and
book-entry MLP Common Units, accompanied by all documents reasonably required
to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the delivery of the Applicable Merger Consideration in
any name other than that of the record holder of such MLP Common Units,
or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes
have been paid or are not payable. Until such required documentation has been
delivered and Certificates, if any, have been surrendered, as contemplated by
this Section 3.4(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to

 



19  represent only the right to receive upon such delivery and surrender the
Applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of MLP Units, distributions
pursuant to Section 3.4(c), and (without the necessity of such surrender) any
cash or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
3.2.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Certificates_. No dividends or
other distributions declared with respect to Buyer Common Units with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to New Buyer Common Units that such
holder would be entitled to receive in accordance herewith and no Fractional
Unit Payment shall be paid to any such holder until such holder shall have
delivered the required documentation and surrendered any such Certificate in
accordance with this Article III. Subject to applicable Law, following
compliance with the requirements of Section 3.4(b), there shall be paid to
each such holder of New Buyer Common Units, without interest, (i) promptly
after such compliance, the amount of any Fractional Unit Payment to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.4(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions previously paid with respect to the New Buyer Common
Units issuable with respect to such Certificate that have a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the time of surrender and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such New Buyer Common Units with a
record date after the Effective Time and prior to such surrender and a payment
date subsequent to such surrender. 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in MLP Common Units or MLP Class D Units_.
The Applicable Merger Consideration paid upon conversion of an MLP Common
Unit or Class D Unit in accordance with the terms hereof and any declared
distributions to be paid on MLP Common Units or MLP Class D Units as described
in Section 3.2(c) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such MLP Units.

(e) _Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional New
Buyer Common Units or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the
surrender of MLP Common Units or MLP Class D Units outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and such fractional units shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a unitholder of Buyer.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each registered
holder of MLP Units converted in the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fractional New Buyer Common Unit (after taking into
account all MLP Units exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, from Buyer in exchange for such fractional unit, an amount (a "
_Fractional Unit Payment_ ") in cash (without interest rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by
(ii) the average of the closing price of Buyer Common Units on the NYSE
Composite Transaction Reporting System as reported in The Wall Street Journal
(but subject to correction for typographical or other manifest errors in such
reporting) over the five-day trading period ending on the third trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, all
references to the "Applicable Merger Consideration" shall be deemed to include
Fractional Unit Payments (if any), unless the context suggests otherwise.

 



20 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the Holders of the Certificates for twelve months
after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Buyer, upon demand by Buyer, and
any Holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with
this Article III shall thereafter look only to Buyer and only as general
creditors thereof for payment of their claim for New Buyer Common Units, any
Fractional Unit Payment and any distributions with respect to New Buyer Common
Units to which such Holders may be entitled. If any Certificates shall not
have been surrendered prior to such date on which any New Buyer Common Units,
any Fractional Unit Payment or any distributions with respect to New Buyer
Common Units in respect of such Certificate would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such units, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Buyer, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, none of Buyer,
Buyer General Partner, MLP, MLP General Partner, the Surviving Entity or their
respective Representatives shall be liable to any Person in respect of any New
Buyer Common Units (or distributions with respect thereto) or Fractional Unit
Payment properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Each of Buyer, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of MLP Units such amounts or
securities as Buyer, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment or issuance. To
the extent that amounts or securities are so withheld by Buyer, the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts or securities shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid or issued to
the holder of MLP Units in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Buyer, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be. 

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Buyer, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a bond, in a
customary amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Applicable Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the MLP Units represented by such Certificate and any
distributions to which the Holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
3.4(b) or (c).

 

(j) _Book Entry and Admission of Holders of New Buyer Common Units as
Additional Limited Partners of Buyer_. All New Buyer Common Units to be
issued in the Merger shall be issued in book-entry form, without physical
certificates. Upon the issuance of New Buyer Common Units to the Holders of
MLP Units in accordance with this Section 3.4, Buyer and Buyer General
Partner shall be deemed to have automatically

 



21  consented to the admission of such holder as a limited partner of Buyer in
respect of its New Buyer Common Units and shall reflect such admission on the
books and records of Buyer.

 

(k) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Buyer on a daily
basis, in Buyers sole discretion; _provided, however,_ that (i) any
investment of such Exchange Fund shall be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal
and interest by, the U.S. government and (ii) no such investment or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable
to MLP unitholders pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 3.4. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
promptly to Buyer.

 

SECTION 3.5 Treatment of Awards under MLP Unit Plan.

 

(a) _MLP Restricted Common Units_. All restrictions on each MLP Common Unit
that is a restricted unit issued pursuant to the MLP Unit Plan (an " _MLP
Restricted Common Unit_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, lapse. Each such MLP
Restricted Common Unit outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than any
MLP Restricted Common Units surrendered in connection with the payment of
Taxes, if any, due upon the lapse of restrictions described in this Section
3.5(a), as permitted by and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the MLP Unit Plan) shall be considered an outstanding MLP Common Unit for all
purposes of this Agreement, including with respect to the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article III.

 

(b) _MLP Phantom Units_. Each MLP Phantom Unit that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest
in full and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse. Each such MLP
Common Unit that shall be issued in settlement of such MLP Phantom Unit
(other than any MLP Common Units withheld in connection with the payment of
Taxes, if any, due with respect to such MLP Phantom Units, as permitted by and
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the MLP Unit Plan) shall
be considered outstanding as of the Effective Time for all purposes of this
Agreement, including with respect to the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article III. Each MLP Phantom Unit that
is payable solely in cash and that vests pursuant to this Section 3.5(b)
shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, vest in full and shall become immediately payable
in cash.

 

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE MLP PARTIES

Except as disclosed in the MLP SEC Reports (excluding any disclosures set
forth in any "risk factor" section and in any section relating to forward-
looking statements, to the extent that they are cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature) filed prior to the Execution Date or

 



22  as set forth in a section of the MLP Disclosure Schedule corresponding to
the applicable Sections of this Article IV to which such disclosure applies (
_provided_ that any information set forth in one section of the MLP
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other section thereof to
which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face, except that no such
information shall be deemed to apply, and no disclosure in the MLP SEC
reports shall be deemed to be an exception, to Section 4.2(a), Section 4.3(a),
Section 4.3(b) or Section 4.17(a)), the MLP Parties hereby represent and
warrant, jointly and severally, to the Buyer Parties that: 

SECTION 4.1 Organization; Qualification.

 

(a) Each of the MLP Group Entities is a limited partnership, limited liability
company, corporation or otherwise duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the law of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of the
MLP Group Entities has all requisite partnership, limited liability company,
corporate or other power and authority, as the case may be, to own, lease or
otherwise hold and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted, except in each case where the failure to be
duly organized, validly existing or to have such power or authority,
individually or in the aggregate, does not constitute an MLP Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Section 4.1(b) of the MLP Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
Execution Date, a true and complete list of the MLP Group Entities, together
with (i) the legal nature of each such Person, (ii) the jurisdiction of
organization or formation of such Person, (iii) the name of the MLP Group
Entity that owns directly or of record any equity or similar interest in such
Person and (iv) the interest (expressed in a percentage or other amount) owned
by such MLP Group Entity in such Person. Each of the MLP Group Entities is
duly qualified and in good standing to do business as a foreign limited
partnership, limited liability company, corporation or otherwise, as the case
may be, in each jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business
or the ownership, leasing, holding or operating of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, does not
constitute an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Each of the MLP Parties has heretofore made available to Buyer
complete and correct copies of its Governing Documents, in each case as
amended to the Execution Date, and such Governing Documents are in full force
and effect.

SECTION 4.2 Authority; No Violation; Consents and Approvals.

(a) Each of the MLP Parties has all requisite limited liability company or
partnership power and authority, as applicable, to enter into this Agreement
and to carry out its obligations hereunder and, subject to, with respect to
consummation of the Merger, MLP Unitholder Approval, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
each MLP Party of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite
limited liability company or partnership, as applicable, action on the part of
such MLP Party. Subject to MLP Unitholder Approval, no other limited liability
company or partnership proceedings are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by

 



23  this Agreement (except for the filing of the appropriate merger documents as
required by Delaware law). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by each MLP Party and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the Other Parties, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement
of each MLP Party, enforceable against such MLP Party in accordance with its
terms (except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
Proceeding in equity or at law)). The adoption of this Agreement by the
affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of at least a "Unit Majority" (as
such term is defined in the MLP Partnership Agreement) (the " _MLP Unitholder
Approval_ ") is the only additional vote of partnership interests in MLP
necessary to approve this Agreement and the Merger.

 

(b) Assuming the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 4.2(b)
of the MLP Disclosure Schedule and the MLP Unitholder Approval are obtained
or made, neither the execution and delivery by the MLP Parties of this
Agreement, nor the consummation by the MLP Parties of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the MLP Parties with any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement, will (i) violate any provision of the
Governing Documents of any of the MLP Group Entities; (ii) result in any
breach of or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of any obligation or the
loss of any benefit under any agreement, permit, franchise, note, indenture,
bond, mortgage, lease or instrument to which any of the MLP Group Entities is
a party or by or to which any of their properties are bound; (iii) result in
the creation of an Encumbrance, other than Permitted Encumbrances, upon or
require the sale or give any Person the right to acquire any of the assets of
any of the MLP Group Entities, or restrict, hinder, impair or limit the
ability of any of the MLP Group Entities to carry on its business as and where
it is now being carried on; or (iv) violate any Law applicable to the MLP
Group Entities, except for matters described in clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv)
that do not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an MLP Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, or permit from, any Governmental Entity, is
required to be obtained or made by any MLP Group Entity in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the MLP Parties or the
consummation by the MLP Parties of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except for: (i) the filing with the SEC of (A) a proxy
statement in preliminary and definitive form relating to the meeting of the
unitholders of MLP to be held in connection with adoption of this Agreement
and (B) such reports under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and such other
compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, as
may be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the filing of the certificate of merger
with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; (iii) any
filings, consents, authorizations, approvals or exemptions in connection with
compliance with the rules of the NYSE; (iv) such filings, consents,
authorizations, approvals or exemptions as may be required by any applicable
state

 



24  securities or "blue sky" or takeover laws; and (v) any such consent,
approval, order, authorization, registration, filing, or permit that the
failure to obtain or make do not constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.3 Capitalization. 

(a) MLP General Partner is the sole general partner of MLP. MLP General
Partner is the sole record and beneficial owner of the MLP General Partner
Interest and MLP Incentive Distribution Rights, and such general partner
interest and MLP Incentive Distribution Rights have been duly authorized and
validly issued in accordance with applicable Law and the MLP Partnership
Agreement. Except as provided in the MLP Partnership Agreement, MLP General
Partner owns the MLP General Partner Interest and MLP Incentive Distribution
Rights free and clear of any Encumbrances. As of the Execution Date, CW Gas
Holdings is the sole member of MLP General Partner and is the sole record and
beneficial owner of all limited liability company interests in MLP General
Partner, and such limited liability company interest has been duly authorized
and validly issued in accordance with applicable Law and the Governing
Documents of MLP General Partner. CW Gas Holdings owns such limited liability
company interest free and clear of any Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances.

 

(b) As of the Execution Date, MLP has no partnership or other equity interests
issued and outstanding other than the following:

(i) 53,696,845 MLP Common Units (excluding any MLP Restricted Common Units and
MLP Phantom Units); 

(ii) 6,190,469 MLP Class D Units, all of which are owned beneficially and of
record by CW Gas Holdings; 

(iii) the MLP Incentive Distribution Rights;

 

(iv) 68,079 MLP Restricted Common Units;

 

(v) 269,969 MLP Phantom Units (of which 8,156 of such MLP Phantom Units are
payable solely in cash); and

 

(vi) the MLP General Partner Interest.

 

Each of the outstanding MLP Units and the limited partner interests
represented thereby have been duly authorized and validly issued in
accordance with applicable Law and the MLP Partnership Agreement, and are
fully paid (to the extent required under the MLP Partnership Agreement) and
non-assessable (except to the extent such non-assessability may be affected
by Sections 17-607 and 17-804 of DRULPA). Such MLP Units were not issued in
violation of any pre-emptive or similar rights. Except as set forth in this
Section 4.3 and in Section 4.3(b) of the MLP Disclosure Schedule, (i) there
are no outstanding options, warrants, subscriptions, puts, calls or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments (pre-emptive, contingent or
otherwise) obligating any of the MLP Group Entities to offer, issue, sell,
redeem, repurchase, 

 



25  otherwise acquire or transfer, pledge or encumber any equity interest in any
of the MLP Group Entities; (ii) there are no outstanding securities or
obligations of any kind of any of the MLP Group Entities that are convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for any equity interest in any of the MLP
Group Entities or any other Person, and none of the MLP Group Entities has any
obligation of any kind to issue any additional securities or to pay for or
repurchase any securities; (iii) there are no outstanding equity appreciation
rights, phantom equity or similar rights based on the value of the equity,
book value, income or any other attribute of any of the MLP Group Entities;
(iv) there are no outstanding bonds, debentures or other evidences of
indebtedness of any of the MLP Group Entities having the right to vote (or
that are exchangeable for or convertible or exercisable into securities of any
MLP Group Entity or securities having the right to vote) with the Holders of
the MLP Units on any matter; and (v) except as described in the MLP
Partnership Agreement, there are no unitholder agreements, proxies, voting
trusts, rights to require registration under securities Law or other
arrangements or commitments to which any of the MLP Group Entities is a party
or by which any of their securities are bound with respect to the voting,
disposition or registration of any outstanding securities of any of the MLP
Group Entities.

(c) Other than with respect to the MLP Group Entities, MLP does not own
beneficially, directly or indirectly, any equity securities or similar
interests of any Person. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of each MLP Subsidiary (i) have been duly authorized
and validly issued, (ii) except as provided in the applicable Governing
Documents and for Permitted Encumbrances, are owned, directly or indirectly,
by MLP free and clear of any Encumbrances and (iii) in the case of
corporations, are fully paid and non-assessable.

(d) Except with respect to the ownership of any equity or long-term debt
securities between or among the MLP Group Entities, none of the MLP Group
Entities owns or will own at the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, any
equity or long-term debt securities of any corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, association or other entity.

SECTION 4.4 Financial Statements. The historical financial statements of MLP
included in the MLP SEC Reports, including all related notes and schedules
(the " _MLP Financial Statements_ "): (i) comply as to form in all material
respects with the Securities Act, Exchange Act and applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto; (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of MLP and the MLP Subsidiaries, as of the respective dates
thereof, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and changes
in partners equity of the entities to which such MLP Financial Statements
relate for the periods indicated; and (iii) have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X) and
subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal year-end
adjustments.

 



26 SECTION 4.5 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.

 

(a) Neither MLP nor any of the MLP Subsidiaries has any indebtedness or
liability, absolute or contingent, which is of a nature required to be
reflected on the balance sheet of MLP or in the notes thereto, in each case
prepared in conformity with GAAP, and which is not shown or reserved against
on the MLP Financial Statements, other than

 

(i) liabilities incurred or accrued in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2012, including liens for
current Taxes and assessments not in default;

(ii) liabilities of MLP or any of the MLP Subsidiaries that, individually or
in the aggregate, are not material to the MLP Group Entities, taken as a
whole; or

(iii) liabilities that have been discharged or paid in full prior to the
Execution Date.

(b) Neither MLP nor any of the MLP Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among MLP and any of
the MLP Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity
or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of
such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, MLP in MLPs published financial statements or
any MLP SEC Reports.

SECTION 4.6 MLP SEC Reports and Internal Controls.

(a) Since December 31, 2010, all reports (except for the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which is addressed in Section 4.7), including but
not limited to the Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q and the Current Reports on Form 8-K, forms, schedules, statements and
other documents required to be filed or furnished by MLP with or to the SEC,
as applicable, pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the " _MLP
SEC Reports_ "), have been timely filed or furnished in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the SEC. All such MLP SEC Reports (i) complied as to
form in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) as of its filing date in the case of any
Exchange Act report and as of its effective date in the case of any Securities
Act filing, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. As of the Execution Date, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect
to the MLP SEC Reports. To the Knowledge of the MLP, none of the MLP SEC
Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 



27 (b) MLP has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. MLPs disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by MLP in the reports that it files under
the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to MLPs management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). MLPs management has completed its
assessment of the effectiveness of MLPs internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2012, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. To MLPs Knowledge, it has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluations, to MLPs outside auditors and the audit
committee of the MLP Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect MLPs ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the MLPs internal controls over financial reporting.

SECTION 4.7 Information Supplied. None of the information to be supplied by
the MLP Group Entities for inclusion in (a) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
be filed with the SEC, and any amendments or supplements thereto, or (b) the

SECTION 4.8 Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits.

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters (which are provided for in Section
4.14), Environmental Law (which is provided for in Section 4.11) and employee
benefit matters (which are provided for in Section 4.15), each of the MLP
Group Entities is in compliance with all, and is not in default under or in
violation of any, applicable Law, other than any noncompliance, default or
violation which would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an MLP
Material Adverse Effect. No MLP Group Entity has received any written
communication within the past two years from a Governmental Entity that
alleges that any MLP Group Entity is not in compliance with or is in default
or violation of any applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default
or violation would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP
Material Adverse Effect.

 



28 (b) The MLP Group Entities are in possession of all franchises,
tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders necessary under
applicable Law to own, lease and operate their properties and to lawfully
carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively, the
" _MLP Permits_ "), except where the failure to be in possession of such MLP
Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an MLP
Material Adverse Effect. None of the MLP Group Entities is in default or
violation of any of the MLP Permits, except for any such defaults or
violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an MLP
Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the MLP
Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of MLP, threatened, except where such
suspension or cancellation would not constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect. As of the Execution Date, to the
Knowledge of MLP, no event or condition has occurred or exists which would
result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or
acceleration of an obligation of the MLP Group Entities under, any MLP Permit,
or has caused (or would cause) an applicable Governmental Entity to fail or
refuse to issue, renew or extend any MLP Permit (in each case, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both), except for violations, breaches, defaults,
losses, accelerations or failures that would not constitute, individually or
in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

29 (iv) which is a lease or license (whether of real, personal or

more that cannot be terminated by any MLP Group Entity on not more than 60
days notice without payment by such MLP Group Entity of any material penalty;

 

(v) which is an agreement for the purchase of materials, supplies, goods,
services, equipment or other assets that in each case both (A) cannot be
terminated by any MLP Group Entity on not more than 60 days notice without
payment by any of MLP Group Entity of any material penalty and (B) involves
annual revenues or payments in excess of $10,000,000; 

(vi) which is a partnership, joint venture or other similar agreement or
arrangement;

 

(vii) which is a contract relating to the acquisition or disposition of any

(x) any contract relating to the construction of capital assets or other
capital expenditures in each case that involves annual revenues or payments in
excess of $10,000,000.

 

(b) Except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a Proceeding in equity or at law); _provided, however_ , that
any indemnity, contribution and exoneration provisions contained in any such
MLP Material Agreement may be limited by applicable Law and public policy,
each of the MLP Material Agreements (i) constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the applicable MLP Group Entity and, to the Knowledge
of the MLP Parties, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the other
parties thereto, (ii) is in full force and effect as of the Execution Date and

aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

(c) There is not, to the Knowledge of any of the MLP Parties, under any MLP
Material Agreement, any default or event which, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of any of the parties thereto,
except such events of default and other events as to which requisite waivers
or consents have been obtained or which would not constitute, individually or
in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.10 Legal Proceedings. There are no pending (or, to the Knowledge of
the MLP Parties, threatened) Proceedings, with respect to which any MLP Group
Entity has been contacted in writing by counsel for the plaintiff or claimant,

operations or business and which constitute, individually or in the aggregate,
an MLP Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not individually or in the
aggregate constitute an MLP Material Adverse Effect, none of the MLP Group
Entities is a party or subject to or in default under any Order applicable to
it or any of its properties, assets, operations or business.

 

SECTION 4.11 Environmental Matters. Except as reflected in the MLP Financial

operations are in compliance with all Environmental Law and Environmental
Permits;

(b) each of the MLP Group Entities has, as applicable, developed and submitted
or obtained and maintained all Environmental Permits necessary for the conduct
and operation of its business as currently conducted and operated, and all
such Environmental Permits are in full force and effect and to the Knowledge
of the MLP Parties, there is no pending or threatened challenge to any
Environmental Permit or reason to believe any pending application for any
Environmental Permit will not be approved in reasonably acceptable form and
substance;

(c) none of the MLP Group Entities has received any written notice from any
Person alleging with respect to any of the MLP Group Entities, the violation
of or liability under any Environmental Law (including liability as a

any Environmental Permit, and to the Knowledge of the MLP Parties, no
occurrence or condition exists that would reasonably be expected to result in
the receipt of such notice;

 

(d) there has been no Release of any Hazardous Material at, on, under or from
any real properties or facilities as a result of the operations of the MLP
Group Entities that has not been remediated as required by any Environmental
Law or Environmental Permit or otherwise adequately reserved for in the MLP

expected to result in any of the MLP Group Entities having liability under any
Environmental Law or Environmental Permit; and

 



31 (e) the MLP Group Entities have provided or otherwise made available to

This Section 4.11, and Sections 4.2(b) and 4.2(c), 4.5, 4.9 and 4.13 hereof,

such MLP Group Entity, in each case which is material to the business of such
MLP Group Entity, free and clear of all Encumbrances except Permitted
Encumbrances, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from each Person (collectively,

extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to
or affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a Proceeding in
equity or at law), and grant the rights purported to be granted thereby and
all rights necessary thereunder for the current operation of the businesses of
the MLP Group Entities, except where the failure of any such right-of-way to
be valid or enforceable or to grant the rights purported to be

perform or any such revocations, terminations and impairments that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in an MLP Material Adverse Effect;

severally, to the MLP Parties that:

 

SECTION 5.1 Organization; Qualification.

38  requisite partnership, limited liability company, corporate or other power
and authority, as the case may be, to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted, except in each case where the failure to be organized, validly
existing or to have such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate,
does not constitute a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Execution Date, a true and complete list of the Buyer Group Entities,
together with (i) the legal nature of each such Person, (ii) the jurisdiction

the ownership, leasing, holding or operating of its properties makes
such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, does
not constitute a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for the
filing of the appropriate merger documents as required by Delaware law). This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Buyer Party and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Other
Parties, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of each Buyer Party,
enforceable against such Buyer Party in accordance with its terms (except
insofar as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to
or affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity

applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto; (ii) fairly present in all material respects the

Regulation S-X) and subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to
normal year-end adjustments.

SECTION 5.5 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.

(a) Neither Buyer nor any of the Buyer Subsidiaries has any indebtedness or
liability, absolute or contingent, which is of a nature required to be
reflected on the balance sheet of Buyer or in the notes thereto, in each case

(i) liabilities incurred or accrued in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since September 30, 2012, including liens for
current Taxes and assessments not in default;

 



42 (ii) liabilities of Buyer or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries that, individually

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet

including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of
such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Buyer in Buyers published financial statements or
any Buyer SEC Reports.

SECTION 5.6 Buyer SEC Reports and Internal Controls. 

(a) Since September 30, 2010, all reports (except for the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, which is addressed in Section 5.7), including but not
limited to the Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
and the Current Reports on Form 8-K, forms, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed or furnished by Buyer with or to the SEC, as
applicable, pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the " _Buyer
SEC Reports_ "), have been timely filed or furnished in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the SEC. All such Buyer SEC Reports (i) complied as
to form in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) as of its filing date in the case of any
Exchange Act report and as of its effective date in the case of any Securities
Act filing, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. As of the Execution Date, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to
the Buyer SEC Reports. To the Knowledge of Buyer, none of the Buyer SEC
Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

(b) Buyer has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Buyers disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by Buyer in the reports that it files under the
Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Buyers management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the

 



43  certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Buyers management has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of Buyers internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended September 30, 2012, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To Buyers Knowledge, it has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluations, to Buyers outside auditors and the audit committee
of the Buyer Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect Buyers ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Buyers
internal controls over financial reporting.

the Buyer Group Entities for inclusion in (a) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
to be filed with the SEC, and any amendments or supplements thereto, or (b)
the Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC in connection with the
Merger, and any amendments or supplements thereto, will, at the respective
times such documents are filed, and, in the case of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, at the time the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to MLP Unitholders, at the
time of the MLP Unitholders Meeting and at the Effective Time, and, in the
case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be made therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

SECTION 5.8 Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits.

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters (which are provided for in Section
5.14), Environmental Law (which is provided for in Section 5.11) and employee
benefit matters (which are provided for in Section 5.15), each of the Buyer
Group Entities is in compliance with all, and is not in default under or in
violation of, applicable Law, other than any noncompliance, default or
violation which would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect. No Buyer Group Entity has received any written
communication within the past two years from a Governmental Entity that
alleges that any Buyer Group Entity is not in compliance with or is in default
or violation of any applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default
or violation would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Buyer Group Entities are in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders necessary under applicable Law to
own, lease and operate their properties and to lawfully carry on their
businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively, the " _Buyer
Permits_ "), except where the failure to be in possession of such Buyer
Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Buyer Group Entities in default or
violation

 



44  of any of the Buyer Permits, except for any such defaults or violations that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Buyer Permits is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened, except where such
suspension or cancellation would not constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. As of the Execution Date, to
the Knowledge of Buyer, no event or condition has occurred or exists which
would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or
acceleration of an obligation of the Buyer Group Entities under, any Buyer
Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an applicable Governmental Entity to
fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend any Buyer Permit (in each case, with
or without notice or lapse of time or both), except for violations, breaches,
defaults, losses, accelerations or failures that would not constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

purport to materially restrict or alter the conduct of business of, whether or
not binding on, Buyer or any controlled Affiliate of Buyer, including by
materially restricting the disposition of any business or assets; 

(iv) which is a lease or license (whether of real, personal or intangible
property) providing for annual rentals or fees of $2,000,000 or more that

(v) which is an agreement for the purchase of materials, supplies, goods,
services, equipment or other assets that in each case both (A) cannot be
terminated by any Buyer Group Entity on not more than 60 days notice without
payment by any of Buyer Group Entity of any material penalty and (B) involves
annual revenues or payments in excess of $10,000,000;

 



45 (vi) which is a partnership, joint venture or other similar agreement
or arrangement;

(vii) which is a contract relating to the acquisition or disposition of any
business or assets (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or

(x) any contract relating to the construction of capital assets or other
capital expenditures in each case that involves annual revenues or payments in

(b) Except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a Proceeding in equity or at law); _provided, however_ , that
any indemnity, contribution and exoneration provisions contained in any such
Buyer Material Agreement may be limited by applicable Law and public policy,
each of the Buyer Material Agreements (i) constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the applicable Buyer Group Entity and, to the knowledge of the
Buyer Parties, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the other
parties thereto, (ii) is in full force and effect as of the Execution Date,
and (iii) will be in full force and effect upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case unless the failure
to be so would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. 

(c) There is not, to the Knowledge of any of the Buyer Parties, under any
Buyer Material Agreement, any default or event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of any of the parties
thereto, except such events of default and other events as to which requisite
waivers or consents have been obtained or which would not constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 



46 SECTION 5.10 Legal Proceedings. There are no pending (or to the Knowledge of
the Buyer Parties, threatened) Proceedings, with respect to which any Buyer
Group Entity has been contacted in writing by counsel for the plaintiff or
claimant, against or affecting any Buyer Group Entity or any of their
properties, assets, operations or business and which constitute, individually
or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not
individually constitute a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, none of the Buyer
Group Entities is a party or subject to or in default under any Order
applicable to it or any of its properties, assets, operations or business.

SECTION 5.11 Environmental Matters. Except as reflected in the Buyer
Financial Statements, and except for any such matter that individually or in

Permits;

(b) each of the Buyer Group Entities has, as applicable, developed and
submitted or obtained and maintained all Environmental Permits necessary for
the conduct and operation of its business as currently conducted and operated,
and all such Environmental Permits are in full force and effect and to
the Knowledge of the Buyer Parties, there is no pending or threatened
challenge to any Environmental Permit or reason to believe any pending
application for any Environmental Permit will not be approved in reasonably
acceptable form and substance; 

(c) none of the Buyer Group Entities has received any written notice from any
Person alleging, with respect to any of the Buyer Group Entities, the
violation of or liability under any Environmental Law (including liability as
a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or any analogous state laws) or
any Environmental Permit, and to the Knowledge of the Buyer Parties, no
occurrence or condition exists that would reasonably be expected to result in
the receipt of such notice;

(d) there has been no Release of any Hazardous Material at, on, under or from
any real properties or facilities as a result of the operations of the Buyer
Group Entities that has not been remediated as required by any Environmental
Law or Environmental Permit or otherwise adequately reserved for in the Buyer
Financial Statements and to the Knowledge of the Buyer Parties, there is no

Parties with respect to Environmental Permits, the Release of or exposure to
Hazardous Materials and Environmental Law.

(b) Each of the Buyer Group Entities owns or has the right to use such
rights-of-way as are necessary to conduct its business in the manner described

except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a Proceeding in equity or at law), and grant the rights purported to be
granted thereby and all rights necessary thereunder for the current operation
of the businesses of the Buyer Group Entities, except where the failure of any
such right-of-way to be valid or enforceable or to grant the rights purported

the aggregate, result in an Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Buyer
Group Entities has fulfilled and performed all its material obligations with

registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of the New

thereto, the " _Registration Statement_ "). As promptly as practicable
following the Execution Date, the Parties shall make all required filings
under applicable state securities and blue sky Laws; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such filings shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result
thereof, Buyer would become subject to general service of process or to
qualification to do business as a foreign partnership doing business in such
jurisdiction solely as a result of such filing. The Registration Statement
and each such filing shall comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and all other applicable Law. Each of
the Parties further agrees that if it shall become aware prior to the date of

statements in the Registration Statement to become false or misleading with

they were made, not false or misleading, it shall, to the extent permitted by
Law, promptly inform the Other Parties thereof and take the necessary steps
to correct the Registration Statement. Each of Parties shall provide the Other
Parties with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Registration
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to filing the on the

made with the SEC as such Party shall reasonably request. No filings of the
Registration Statement (or any amendments or supplements thereto) shall be
made without the consent of all Parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to documents that are incorporated by reference into the
Registration Statement, the foregoing consent right shall only apply with
respect to information relating to the Other Parties or their businesses,
financial conditions or results of operations; _provided_ , _further_ , that
in connection with an MLP Recommendation Change, the MLP Parties may file an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus without the consent
of the Buyer Parties (and without providing the Buyer Parties the opportunity
to review and comment on such amendment or supplement) in order to effect an
MLP Recommendation Change, describe the reasons for such MLP Recommendation
Change and disclose any additional information reasonably related to the MLP
Recommendation Change. The Parties shall (a) promptly notify the Other Parties
of receipt of any comments from the SEC or any other applicable government
official and of any requests by the SEC or any other applicable government
official for amendments or supplements to any of the filings with the SEC in

additional information; and (b) promptly supply the Other Parties with
copies of all correspondence with the SEC or any other applicable government
official with respect thereto. Each of the Parties shall use its respective

purpose of obtaining the MLP Unitholder Approval. Unless there has been an MLP
Recommendation Change, (i) the MLP Parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to solicit and obtain the MLP Unitholder Approval; and (ii) the MLP
Parties shall include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus the recommendation by
the MLP Board of the adoption of this Agreement by the Holders of MLP Units
(the " _MLP Recommendation_ "). The MLP Parties shall be required to cause
the MLP Unitholders Meeting be called and held even if the MLP Board (or the
MLP Conflicts Committee) effected an MLP Recommendation Change.

 

(b) The MLP Parties shall not adjourn or postpone the MLP Unitholders Meeting
except to the extent the MLP Board or the MLP Conflicts Committee determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such adjournment
or postponement is required by applicable securities Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the MLP Parties (or the MLP Conflicts Committee), after
consultation with Buyer, may adjourn or postpone the MLP Unitholders Meeting
(i) to the extent the MLP Board or the MLP Conflicts Committee believes in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that such
adjournment or postponement is necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or other required
public disclosure is provided to Holders of MLP Units and that such Holders of
MLP Units have a reasonable period of time to review any such supplement or
amendment; (ii) if as of the time for which the MLP Unitholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there
are insufficient MLP Units represented (either in Person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting; or (iii) to
solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the MLP Unitholder
Approval; _provided_ , _further_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, the MLP Unitholders Meeting may not be adjourned or postponed to a

meeting until the fifth Business Day after the expiration of

Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any solicitation,
discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect
to or that may reasonably be expected to lead to an MLP Takeover Proposal.

 



61 (b) The MLP Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of
furnishing information) any inquiries regarding, or the making or submission
of any proposal or offer that constitutes an MLP Takeover Proposal (
_provided_ that the nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any of the MLP
Parties or their Representatives from informing any Person of the provisions
of this Section 6.5 or from contacting any Person or group of Persons who has
made an MLP Takeover Proposal after Execution Date solely to request the
clarification of terms and condition thereof to determine whether the
MLP Takeover Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal); (ii) conduct or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any MLP Takeover Proposal; (iii) furnish to any Person
any non-public information or data relating to MLP or any of its Subsidiaries
or afford access to the business, properties, assets, or, except as required
by Law or the MLP Partnership Agreement, books or records of MLP or any of its
Subsidiaries in any such case in connection with an MLP Takeover Proposal; or
(iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow any
MLP Group Entity to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to
lead to any MLP Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
permitted to be entered into by, and in accordance with, the next sentence).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the MLP
Unitholder Approval, the MLP Parties and their Subsidiaries and
Representatives may take the actions described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of
this Section 6.5(b) with respect to a third Person that makes a bona fide
unsolicited written MLP Takeover Proposal that did not result from a material
breach of this Section 6.5(b) (a " _Receiving Party_ "), if (A) the MLP Board
(or the MLP Conflicts Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that such MLP Takeover Proposal is, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an MLP Superior Proposal; (B) the MLP
Board (or the MLP Conflicts Committee), after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, determines in good faith that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its duties under the
MLP Partnership Agreement or applicable Law; and (C) prior to furnishing any
such non-public information to such Receiving Party, MLP receives from such
Receiving Party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially
similar to, and not materially less favorable to the MLP Parties in the
aggregate than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (including
the standstill obligations contained in Section 13 and the non-
solicitation obligations contained in Section 14 of the Confidentiality
Agreement). The MLP Parties shall as promptly as practicable (in all events
within 24 hours) provide to Buyer a copy of such confidentiality agreement.
The MLP Parties shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours), advise Buyer in writing of any request for non-public information in
connection with an MLP Takeover Proposal, any MLP Takeover Proposal received
from any third person, or any request for discussions or negotiations with
respect to any MLP Takeover Proposal, and, in the case of any MLP Takeover
Proposal received, the material terms and conditions of such MLP Takeover
Proposal. The MLP Parties shall, as promptly as practicable (and in all
events

 



62  within 24 hours), provide to Buyer complete copies of any written proposal
or offers (including proposed agreements) received by the MLP Parties or any
of their Subsidiaries or Representatives in connection with any of the
foregoing, and the identity of the Person making any such request or MLP
Takeover Proposal.

(c) The MLP Board and the MLP Conflicts Committee shall not, in each case
unless permitted by Section 6.5(d), (i) fail to include the MLP Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus; (ii) withdraw, or modify in any manner
adverse to the Buyer Parties, or propose publicly to withdraw, or modify in
any manner adverse to the Buyer Parties), the MLP Recommendation; or (iii)
recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
approve, any MLP Takeover Proposal (any action described in this Section
6.5(c) being referred to as an " _MLP Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit accurate disclosure
(and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be an MLP Recommendation Change)
of factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results
of operations of the MLP Parties or the Buyer Parties or the fact that an MLP
Takeover Proposal has been made, the identity of the Person making such
proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or otherwise, in each case to the extent the MLP Parties
in good faith determine, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that such information, facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed
under applicable Law.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior
to obtaining the MLP Unitholder Approval, the MLP Board (and/or the MLP
Conflicts Committee) may effect an MLP Recommendation Change if the MLP Board
(or the MLP Conflicts Committee), after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, determines in good faith that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its duties under the
MLP Partnership Agreement or applicable Law and:

(i) if the MLP Board (or the MLP Conflicts Committee) intends to effect such
MLP Recommendation Change in response to an MLP Takeover Proposal:

(A) such MLP Takeover Proposal is bona fide, in writing and has not been
withdrawn or abandoned;

(B) the MLP Board (or MLP Conflicts Committee) has determined,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that such MLP Takeover Proposal constitutes an MLP Superior Proposal after
giving effect to all of the adjustments offered by the Buyer Parties pursuant
to clause (E) below; 

(C) the MLP Parties have provided prior written notice to the Buyer Parties in
accordance with Section 9.3 (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of the MLP
Boards (or the MLP Conflicts Committees) intention to effect an MLP
Recommendation Change, and such Superior Proposal Notice has specified the
identity of the Person making such MLP Takeover Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of such MLP Takeover Proposal, and complete copies of any
written proposal or offers (including proposed agreements) received by the MLP
Parties in connection with such MLP Takeover Proposal;

 



63 (D) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the Superior
Proposal Notice as determined in accordance with Section 9.3 and ends at
11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth calendar day following
the date of such delivery (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "), the
MLP Parties shall, and shall cause their Representatives to, (1) negotiate
with the Buyer Parties and its Representatives in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
MLP Board (or the MLP Conflicts Committee) not to effect an MLP
Recommendation Change; and (2) keep the Buyer Parties and its Representatives
reasonably informed with respect to the status and changes in the material
terms and conditions of such MLP Takeover Proposal or other change in
circumstances related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , any material revisions
to such MLP Takeover Proposal (it being agreed that any change in the purchase
price in such MLP Takeover Proposal shall be deemed a material revision)
shall require delivery of a subsequent Superior Proposal Notice and a
subsequent Superior Proposal Notice Period in respect of such revised MLP
Takeover Proposal, except that such subsequent Superior Proposal Notice Period
shall expire upon the later of (x) the end of the initial Superior Proposal
Notice Period and (y) 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the third
calendar day following the date of the delivery of such subsequent Superior
Proposal Notice; and

(E) the MLP Board (or the MLP Conflicts Committee) shall have considered all
revisions to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by
the Buyer Parties and, at the end of the Superior Proposal Notice Period,
shall have determined in good faith that such MLP Takeover Proposal continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such revisions were to be given
effect; or

(ii) if the MLP Board (or the MLP Conflicts Committee) intends to effect such
MLP Recommendation Change due to circumstances not involving an MLP Takeover
Proposal:

(A) the MLP Parties have provided prior written notice to the Buyer Parties
in accordance with Section 9.3 (the " _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") of the
MLP Boards (or the MLP Conflicts Committees) intention to effect an MLP
Recommendation Change, and such Recommendation Change Notice has specified
the reasons for the MLP Recommendation Change;

(B) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the
Recommendation Change Notice as determined in accordance with Section 9.3 and
ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time the date that is the fifth calendar day
following the date of such delivery (the " _Recommendation Change Notice
Period_ "), the MLP Parties shall, and shall cause their Representatives to,
(A) negotiate with the Buyer Parties and its Representatives in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the MLP Board (or the MLP Parties) not to effect an MLP Recommendation
Change; and (B) keep the Buyer Parties and its Representatives reasonably
informed of any change in circumstances related thereto; and

 



64 (C) the MLP Board (or the MLP Conflicts Committee) shall have considered all
revisions to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by
the Buyer Party and, at the end of the Recommendation Change Notice Period,
shall have determined in good faith that the failure to effect an MLP
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its duties under the MLP
Partnership Agreement or applicable Law even if such revisions were to be
given effect.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the MLP Board (or the
MLP Conflicts Committee) from taking and disclosing to the limited partners of
MLP a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to Holders of MLP Units) or
from making any legally required disclosure to the limited partners of MLP.
Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the MLP Board (or the MLP
Conflicts Committee) to the limited partners of MLP pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Holders of MLP Units) shall not be considered an MLP Recommendation Change. 

(f) The MLP Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
request all Persons (other than the Buyer Parties and their Representatives)
who have been furnished confidential information regarding the MLP Parties or
their Subsidiaries in connection with the solicitation of or discussions
regarding an MLP Takeover Proposal within the 12 months prior to the
Execution Date promptly to return or destroy such information to the extent
that the MLP Parties or their respective Subsidiaries are entitled to have
such documents returned or destroyed.

 

(g) Except to the extent the MLP Board (or the MLP Conflicts Committee)
determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its duties under the MLP Partnership Agreement or applicable
Law, each of the MLP Parties agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not
to, release any third Person from the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any agreement to which such MLP Party or its
Subsidiaries is or may become a party.

(h) Each MLP Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to inform all
Representatives of such MLP Party and its Subsidiaries of the restrictions
described in this Section 6.5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.5, any action, or failure to take action, in violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.5 by any Representative of an MLP
Party or any of its Subsidiaries at the direction or with the consent of such
MLP Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 6.5.

SECTION 6.6 Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances. From and after the
Execution Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of
the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and to do or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law and Environmental Law to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the foregoing but subject to
the other terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree that, from time to time,
whether before, at or after the

 



65  Closing Date, each of them shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such instruments of assignment, transfer, conveyance,
endorsement, direction or authorization as may be necessary to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.7 No Public Announcement. On the Execution Date, the Parties shall
issue a joint press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement
and the Merger, which press release shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer
General Partner and MLP General Partner. No Party shall issue any other press
release or make any other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than an MLP Recommendation
Change, as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with the NYSE, in which event the Party making the public
announcement or press release shall, to the extent practicable, (a) notify the
Buyer General Partner or MLP General Partner, as applicable, in advance of
such public announcement or press release; and (b) allow the Other Party
reasonable time to comment on such public announcement in advance of such
issuance) without the prior approval of the Buyer General Partner or MLP
General Partner, as applicable, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer
Parties and the MLP Parties may respond to inquiries from securities analysts
and the news media to the extent necessary to respond to such inquiries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such responses shall be in compliance with
applicable securities Law.

SECTION 6.8 Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, including legal fees,
accounting fees, financial advisory fees and other professional and non-
professional fees and expenses, shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expenses.

SECTION 6.9 Tax Matters.

(a) The Parties intend to take the position that the Merger will constitute
an "assets-over" partnership merger within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i) and any cash deemed received by MLP will be treated
as reimbursement of preformation expenditures in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.707-4(d).

(b) The Buyer Parties and the MLP Parties acknowledge and agree that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall cause a termination of MLP pursuant to Section 708(a)(1)(A) of
the Code. As a result, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the taxable year
of MLP shall end as of the Closing Date and the Parties shall take all actions
permitted under applicable Laws to close the Tax periods of the subsidiaries
of MLP other than Crestwood Midstream Finance Corporation as of the Closing
Date. Allocation of income or deductions relating to the period ending on the
Closing Date shall be taken into account by means of an interim closing of the
books; _provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated for an entire Tax period (including, but not limited to,
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
portion of such Tax period 

 



66  ending on the Closing Date and the remaining portion of such period in
proportion to the number of days in each such period. Buyer shall prepare and
file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of MLP and its
subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall timely provide the MLP Representative with a copy
of any Tax Return (together with all supporting documentation and workpapers)
to be filed by or with respect to MLP or any of its subsidiaries for any Tax
period that begins on or before the Closing Date at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return for the MLP Representatives
review and reasonable comment. Buyer shall take into account any changes
reasonably requested by the MLP Representatives and cause such Tax Return to
be filed timely, providing a copy of the Tax Return as filed to the
MLP Representatives.

(c) All sales, use, stamp, registration, value added, documentary, filing,
recording, transfer or similar fees or Taxes or governmental charges levied
by any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, shall be borne by Buyer. The Parties shall cooperate in good
faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount
of any such Taxes.

SECTION 6.10 Section 16(b). Prior to the Effective Time, MLP and Buyer shall
take such actions as may be necessary to cause acquisitions or dispositions of
equity securities of MLP and Buyer resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each Person (including any Person who may
be deemed to be a "director by deputization" under applicable securities laws)
who may be subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to MLP, or
may become subject to such requirements with respect to Buyer, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with the
procedures set forth in such Rule 16b-3 and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999).

SECTION 6.11 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement or under
the MLP Partnership Agreement, the Governing Documents of the MLP General
Partner or this Agreement in effect on the Execution Date, from the Effective
Time and until the six (6) year anniversary of the Effective Time, Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the Execution Date or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director or officer of any of the MLP Group Entities or who acts as a
fiduciary under any Employee Benefit Plan of the MLP Group Entities (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines,
penalties, expenses (including reasonable attorneys and other professionals
fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement (with the approval of the indemnifying party, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), of or incurred
in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such
Indemnified Person is a party by reason of the fact that such Person is or was
a director or officer of any of the MLP Group Entities, a fiduciary under any
Employee Benefit Plan or is or was serving at the request of any of the MLP
Group Entities as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership,

 



67  limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise existing
prior to or at the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including all
Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or
in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law (and Buyer shall pay expenses incurred in connection therewith
promptly as statements therefor are received to each Indemnified Person to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is
brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) the Indemnified Persons may
retain MLPs regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to
them, and Buyer shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
for the Indemnified Persons promptly as statements therefor are received, and
(ii) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist in the defense of
any such matter (and the Indemnified Persons shall cooperate with Buyer with
respect thereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Any Indemnified Person
wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section
6.11, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify Buyer (but the
failure so to notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations that it
may have under this Section 6.11 except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such Partys position with respect to such claims); _provided,
further_ , that Buyer shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.11(b)
to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one (1) counsel for all
Indemnified Persons in any single action, unless, in the good faith judgment
of any of the Indemnified Persons, there is or may be a conflict of interest
between two or more of such Indemnified Persons, in which case there may be
separate counsel for each similarly situated group. With respect to any
determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
by Buyer under this Section 6.11, such Indemnified Person shall have the
right to require that such determination be made by special, independent legal
counsel jointly selected by the Indemnified Person and Buyer, and who has not
otherwise performed material services for Buyer or the Indemnified Person
within the last three (3) years.

(c) Buyer and the Surviving Entity shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify (i) the certificate of limited partnership or MLP Partnership Agreement
of the Surviving Entity or (ii) the certificate of limited partnership of
Buyer or the Buyer Partnership Agreement, in each case, in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Person to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by
applicable Law. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, fulfill
and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements
between the MLP Group Entities and any of their directors, officers or
employees existing immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) Buyer and the Surviving Entity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, indemnify any Indemnified Person against, and advance expenses to any

 



68  Indemnified Person with respect to, all reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) relating to the
enforcement of such Indemnified Persons rights under this Section 6.11 or
under any Governing Documents or contract; provided that such indemnification
shall be provided only if such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to
be entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder promptly following
such determination.

(e) In the event that Buyer or the Surviving Entity or any of
their respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Buyer and the
Surviving Entity shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11 contemporaneous with
the closing of any such consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance.

 

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, MLP may cause to be put in place, or,
if requested by MLP, the Buyer shall cause to be put in place, and, in either
case, Buyer shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, "tail"
insurance policies covering claims for at least for six (6) years following
the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as MLPs current insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance in an amount and scope of not less than the
existing coverage and having other terms at least as favorable to the insured
Persons as the directors and officers liability insurance coverage
maintained by the MLP Group Entities as of the Execution Date; _provided,
however,_ that in no event shall Buyer or the Surviving Entity be required to
expend pursuant to this Section 6.11(f) more than an amount per year equal to
300% of current annual premiums paid by MLP for such insurance (the " _Premium
Cap_ "), in which case the Surviving Entity shall, and Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, use reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time for the persons who are covered by MLPs existing directors
and officers liability insurance, with the best overall terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage reasonably available for an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. Buyer shall maintain such policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

SECTION 6.12 Distributions. The Buyer Parties and the MLP Parties shall
coordinate with each other the declaration of, and the setting of record dates
and payment dates for, distributions in respect of their respective units so
that, in respect of any fiscal quarter, Holders of MLP Units do not (a)
receive more than one distribution in respect of both (i) MLP Units and (ii)
Buyer Common Units received pursuant to the Merger in exchange therefor; or
(b) fail to receive a distribution in respect of one of (i) MLP Units or (ii)
Buyer Common Units received pursuant to the Merger in exchange therefor.

 

SECTION 6.13 Limited Liability Company Interests of MLP General Partner. At or
prior to the Effective Time, NRGY shall transfer 100% of its limited
liability company interest in MLP General Partner to Buyer General Partner,
which MLP General Partner will at the time of such transfer own 100% of the
MLP Incentive Distribution Rights. At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer
shall cause New General Partner to be formed as a Subsidiary of Buyer.

 



69 SECTION 6.14 Amendment of the MLP Partnership Agreement. At the
Effective Time, the MLP Partnership Agreement shall be amended and restated
so that it reads substantially in the form of the MLP Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement.

SECTION 6.15 Buyer Board Directors. NRGY shall not change, or cause to be
changed, any of the directors of the Buyer Board until the earlier of (a) the
termination of the Option Agreement pursuant to its terms and (b) the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that NRGY may add, or cause to be
added, additional directors to the Buyer Board if NRGY causes the Buyer Board
to delegate to the Buyer Special Committee all its authority to negotiate
and/or approve any amendments, supplements, waivers or modifications in
respect of this Agreement and all other agreements contemplated hereby
(including the Voting Agreement and the Option Agreement), or approve or
agree to any termination of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated
hereby (including the Voting Agreement and the Option Agreement), and exercise
all rights under this Agreement and any other agreement contemplated
hereby (including the Voting Agreement and the Option Agreement).

SECTION 6.16 Financing.

 

(a) The Buyer Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary to arrange the Debt Refinancing on the terms and conditions
described in the Refinancing Commitment Letter, including using their
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Refinancing
Commitment Letter; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
the Buyer Parties to obtaining the Debt Refinancing as set forth in the
Refinancing Commitment Letter that are within its control; (iii)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions (including, if necessary, the flex provisions)
contemplated by the Refinancing Commitment Letter or on other terms no less
favorable to Buyer; (iv) comply with the Buyers obligations under the
Refinancing Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements with respect
thereto; (v) subject to the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Refinancing Commitment Letter, consummate the Debt Refinancing at or prior to
the Effective Time; and (vi) enforce its rights under the Refinancing
Commitment Letter. If any portion of the Debt Refinancing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated in
the Refinancing Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto, the Buyer Parties shall promptly notify the MLP Parties and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to amend, modify, supplement, alter,
restate, substitute or replace the Debt Refinancing with other alternative
financing, on terms no less favorable to Buyer, as promptly as possible;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Parties shall not permit any
amendment, modification, supplement, alteration, restatement, substitution or
replacement of the Refinancing Commitment Letter or the Debt Refinancing on
terms that are less favorable to Buyer, without the prior consent of the MLP
Parties, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. In such event, the term " _Refinancing Commitment Letter_ " as
used herein shall be deemed to include the amended, modified, supplemented,
altered, restated, substituted or 

 



70  replacement, commitment letter. The Buyer Parties shall promptly (and in any
event within two Business Days) notify the MLP Parties: (A) of any default or
breach by any party to the Refinancing Commitment Letter or definitive
documents related to the Debt Refinancing of which the Buyer Parties are
aware; (B) of the receipt of any written notice from any party to the
Refinancing Commitment Letter with respect to (1) any default, breach,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Refinancing Commitment Letter
or definitive documents related to the Debt Refinancing or (2) any material
dispute or disagreement between or among parties to the Refinancing
Commitment Letter or definitive documents related to the Debt Refinancing of
which the Buyer Parties become aware; and (C) if for any reason the Buyer
Parties determine in good faith that they will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Debt Refinancing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Refinancing Commitment Letters. The Buyer Parties
shall keep the MLP Parties informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status of their efforts to arrange the Debt Refinancing and provide copies of
all draft and executed documents related to the Debt Refinancing to the MLP
Parties. In the event that the Buyer Parties are unable to obtain the Debt
Refinancing or alternative financing on terms no less favorable to Buyer, the
Buyer Parties will obtain an amendment to the Buyer Credit Agreement so that
the Buyer will be permitted thereunder to, and will have sufficient funds
available thereunder to, refinance the MLP Credit Agreements at the Closing;
_provided, however,_ that the Buyer Parties shall be permitted to pay any and
all fees to the lenders and administrative agent in connection with any such
amendment without the prior consent of the MLP Parties.

 

(b) The Buyer Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary to maintain in effect the Repurchase Commitment Letter. If a
"Ratings Decline" (as defined in the Buyer Indenture) has occurred within 90
days following the consummation of the General Partner Transactions (or the
Parties reasonably expect such a Ratings Decline to occur) and there has not
been a successful consent solicitation as described in Section 6.17(a), the
Buyer Parties shall comply with all the terms of Section 4.15 of the Buyer
Indenture and conduct a "Change of Control Offer" (as defined in the Buyer
Indenture) under the terms required by the Buyer Indenture and shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange the Repurchase Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Repurchase Commitment Letter,
including using their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to the Buyer to obtaining the
Repurchase Financing as set forth in the Repurchase Commitment Letter that
are within its control; (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Repurchase Commitment Letter (including, if necessary, the flex provisions)
or on other terms no less favorable to the Buyer; (iii) comply with the
Buyers obligations under the Repurchase Commitment Letter and the definitive
agreements with respect thereto; (iv) subject to the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Repurchase Commitment Letter, conduct and consummate the
Repurchase Financing at or prior to the time any repurchases of the Buyer
Notes are required to be made under Section 4.15 of the Buyer Indenture;
and (v) enforce its rights under the Repurchase Commitment Letter. If any
portion of the Repurchase Refinancing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated in the Repurchase
Commitment Letter or the 

 



71  definitive agreements with respect thereto, the Buyer Parties shall promptly
notify the MLP Parties and use their commercially reasonable efforts to amend,
modify, supplement, alter, restate, substitute or replace the Repurchase
Financing with other alternative financing, on terms no less favorable, taken
as a whole, to Buyer, as promptly as possible; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Buyer Parties shall not permit any amendment, modification, supplement,
alteration, restatement, substitution or replacement of the Repurchase
Commitment Letter without the consent of the MLP Parties, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld. In such event, the term " _Repurchase Commitment
Letter_ " as used herein shall be deemed to include the amended, modified,
supplemented, altered, restated, substituted or replacement, commitment
letter. The Buyer Parties shall promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days) notify the MLP Parties: (A) of any default or breach by any
party to the Repurchase Commitment Letter or definitive documents related to
the Repurchase Financing or of which the Buyer Parties are aware; (B) of the
receipt of any written notice from any party to the Repurchase Commitment

consummate a successful consent solicitation (the " _Consent Solicitation_ ")
to waive or otherwise amend the "Change of Control" provision under the Buyer
Indenture, at or prior to the time that the Buyer would be required to
repurchase any Buyer Notes under Section 4.15 of the Buyer Indenture. The
Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) prepare a
consent solicitation statement, including, among other things, (A) a summary
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (B pro forma
financial statements for the Buyer in accordance with Regulation S-X under
the Securities Act that give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Debt Financings; and

each of the Buyer Parties and their applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary,
shall (and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the

Indenture, which supplemental indenture shall implement the
amendments described in the consent solicitation statement, related letter of

Solicitation Documents_ "). Concurrent with the effectiveness of such
supplemental indenture, the Buyer shall pay the Consent Solicitation
consideration in accordance with the Consent Solicitation Documents.

to the completion of the Consent Solicitation any information in the Consent
Solicitation Documents should be discovered by the Buyer Parties, which should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Consent Solicitation
Documents, so that the Consent Solicitation Documents shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,
the party that discovers such information shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement prepared by the Buyer Parties describing such information shall be
disseminated to the holders of the Buyer Notes (which supplement or amendment
and dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of the Buyer Parties,
take the form of a filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.17, the Buyer Parties shall and

Agreement, for which the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and
remedies available at law or equity against the Party that committed a Willful
and Material Breach of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if MLP
pays the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.6(a), the MLP Parties
shall not have any further liability of any kind for any reason in connection
with any breach of Section 6.3, Section 6.4 or Section 6.5; (c) for fraud,
for which the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at law or equity; or (d) for breaches of the Confidentiality
Agreement, for which the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and
remedies provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 8.6 Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement.

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section
8.4(b) or Section 8.4(c), or by MLP pursuant to Section 8.3(b), MLP shall pay
to the Escrow Agent for the benefit of Buyer an amount equal to $50.8 million
(the " _Termination Fee_ ") within three Business Days of the date of such
termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.4(b) or
Section 8.4(c)) or concurrently with such termination (in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.3(b)).

 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by MLP or Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.2(c), MLP shall reimburse the Buyer Parties for all their
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including all
legal fees, accounting fees, financial advisory fees and other professional
and non-professional fees and expenses as well as any commitment fees or other
fees required by the Commitment Letters to be paid by the Buyer Parties, in an
amount not exceeding $10.0 million in the aggregate (the "
_Expense Reimbursement_ "), within three Business Days of the date of such
termination.

(c) In the event that (i) a bona fide MLP Takeover Proposal has been publicly
communicated to or otherwise publicly made known to the unitholders of MLP or
any Person has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to
make an MLP Takeover Proposal and such MLP Takeover Proposal or intention to
make an MLP Takeover Proposal has not been withdrawn prior to the MLP
Unitholder Meeting (or if the MLP Unitholder Meeting has not occurred, prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to 8.2(a) or Section 8.4(a));
(ii) thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(a),
Section 8.2(c) or Section 8.4(a); and (iii) prior to the date that is 12
months after the date of such termination, MLP enters into any definitive
agreement related to an MLP Takeover Proposal, then MLP shall pay to the
Escrow Agent for the benefit of Buyer an amount equal to the Termination Fee
less any previously paid Expense Reimbursement, if and when such Takeover
Proposal is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
Section 8.6(c) "50%" shall substituted for "15%" in the definition of MLP
Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) Any Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement shall be paid by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Buyer in writing in
accordance with Section 9.3. Each of the MLP Parties acknowledges that the
agreements contained

 



83  in this Section 8.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Buyer Parties would
not enter into this Agreement. Each of the MLP Parties further acknowledges
and agrees that a Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather liquidated
damages in amounts reasonably estimated by the Parties to compensate the Buyer
Parties for efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Accordingly, if MLP fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.6 and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer commences a
Proceeding which results in an order against MLP for the Termination Fee or
Expense Reimbursement, MLP shall pay to Buyer its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Proceeding,
together with interest on any unpaid amount of the Termination Fee or Expense
Reimbursement at the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations plus 500
basis points in effect on the date such payment was required to be made,
calculated on a daily basis from the date the Termination Fee or Expense
Reimbursement was required to be paid until the date of the actual payment.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if
a Termination Fee becomes due and payable and MLP pays a Termination Fee,
none of the MLP Parties shall have any further liability of any kind for any
reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated
hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall MLP be
required to pay more than one Termination Fee or more than one Expense
Reimbursement.

(e) Any amounts paid to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 8.6,
together with interest thereon (the " _Escrow Fund_ "), shall be released by
the Escrow Agent to Buyer as follows:

(i) at any time prior to the end of the fiscal year in which the payment was
made to the Escrow Agent, Buyer shall submit to the Escrow Agent a
certificate demanding a portion of the Escrow Fund equal to no greater than
70% of the maximum remaining amount that, in the good faith view of Buyer, may
still be taken into the gross revenues of Buyer and be treated as if such
amount were not "qualifying income" (as defined in Section 7704 of the Code)
while satisfying the qualifying income exception required for partnership
treatment for publicly traded partnerships, after taking into consideration
all other sources of non-qualifying income (such maximum remaining amount, the
" _Non-Qualifying Income Cushion_ "), and the Escrow Agent shall within one
Business Day thereafter, pay Buyer the amount demanded, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Buyer;

(ii) during the fiscal year following the date that the payment was made to
the Escrow Agent but prior to the passage of 30 calendar days following the
filing of the IRS Form 1065 for the prior fiscal year, Buyer shall submit to
the Escrow Agent a certificate identifying the actual Non-Qualifying Income
Cushion from the prior year. If the payment contemplated by clause (i) above
was (A) less than 80% of the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion, then Buyer
shall submit to the Escrow Agent a certificate demanding a portion of the
Escrow Fund equal

 



84  to an amount which, when combined with the payment contemplated by clause
(i) shall equal 90% of the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion, and the
Escrow Agent shall within one Business Day thereafter, pay Buyer the amount
demanded; (B) greater than or equal to 80%, but less than or equal to 90% of
the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion, then Buyer shall notify the Escrow
Agent that it shall not demand any additional payments from the Escrow
Account; and (C) greater than 90% of the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion,
then Buyer shall deliver a certificate to such effect to the Escrow Agent and
return to the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the excess of the
payment contemplated by clause (i) over 80% of the Non-Qualifying Income
Cushion. Any payment under this clause (ii) shall be made by the Escrow Agent,
or Buyer, as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by Buyer or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be;
and

(iii) within one Business Day following the earlier of (A) completion of the
procedures as contemplated by Section 8.6(e)(ii) above and (B) the passage of
30 days following the filing of the IRS Form 1065 for the prior fiscal year,
the Escrow Agent shall pay MLP the remainder, if any, of the Escrow Fund, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated MLP.

(f) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that (i) the amount of a payment, if
any, pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 8.6(e) is uncertain, and that
depending on the amount of the demands made by Buyer pursuant to clause (ii)
of Section 8.6(e), the Escrow Fund may be insufficient to permit payments to
MLP pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 8.6(e); and (ii) MLP shall have no
rights to any amounts in the Escrow Fund or to audit or inquire into the
amounts demanded by or paid to Buyer.

(g) In the event Buyer exercises the "Option" as defined, and in accordance
with, the Option Agreement, the Escrow Agent or Buyer, as applicable, shall
return to MLP an amount equal to $21.8 million upon the full performance by
MLP General Partner, CW Gas Holdings and CW Holdings of their obligations
pursuant to Section 2.3(a) of the Option Agreement within three Business Days
of the date of such performance. Section 8.6(e) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_
in respect of any such return as if "MLP" was the "Buyer" referred to herein.

SECTION 8.7 Procedure for Termination. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this Article VIII shall, in order to be effective, require, in
the case of Buyer, action by the Buyer Board (or a committee thereof to which
the Buyer Board has delegated decision making authority with respect to the
applicable termination right), and, in the case of MLP, action by the MLP
Board (or a committee thereof to which the MLP Board has delegated decision
making authority with respect to the applicable termination right) or, in the
case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.3(b), action by the MLP Conflicts
Committee.

 



85 ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 9.1 Survival. None of the representations, warranties, agreements,
covenants or obligations in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Merger,
except for those agreements, covenants and obligations contained herein
(including Article III, Section 6.11 and Section 6.18) that by their terms are
to be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time and this Article
IX).

SECTION 9.2 Enforcement of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that an award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this
Agreement by any Party and any such breach would cause the non-breaching
Parties irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Parties agree that prior to the
termination of this Agreement, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement by one of the Parties, the Parties shall also be
entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. Such
remedies shall not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement
but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to
each of the Parties.

 

SECTION 9.3 Notices. Any notice, request, instruction, correspondence or other
document to be given hereunder by any Party to the Other Parties (each, a "
_Notice_ ") shall be in writing and delivered in Person or by courier service
requiring acknowledgment of receipt of delivery or mailed by U.S. registered
or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or by
telecopier, as follows; _provided_ , _however_ , that copies to be delivered

SECTION 9.4 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. To the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, the provisions of this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law;
_provided_ , _however_ , the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York with respect to any action including any Financing Source. Each of
the Parties agrees that this Agreement involves at least $100,000 and that
this Agreement has been entered into in express reliance upon 6 Del. C. §
2708\. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally confirms and agrees
that it is and shall continue to be (a) subject to the jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of Delaware and of the federal courts sitting in the State
of Delaware and (b) subject to service of process in the State of Delaware.
Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consents and submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (and, if such court
shall not have subject matter jurisdiction, any Delaware state court and the
federal court of the United States located in the State of Delaware (together
with the Delaware Court of Chancery, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") for any
Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees not to commence any litigation
relating thereto except in such courts); (ii) waives any objection to the
laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not
to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein
has been brought in any inconvenient forum; and (iii) acknowledges and agrees
that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to
involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such Party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to
a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not, and will not permit
its Affiliates to, bring or support any Proceeding of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including with respect to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the United States District Court
for the

 



88  Southern District of New York or any court of the State of New York sitting
in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and agree that the waiver
of jury trial set forth in this Section 9.4 hereof shall be applicable to any
such proceeding.

SECTION 9.5 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers.

(a) Except for the Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement and the exhibits
and schedules hereto constitute the entire agreement between and among the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the Parties, and there are no representations, warranties or
other agreements between or among the Parties in connection with the subject
matter hereof except as set forth specifically herein or contemplated hereby.
Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement (including the
representations and warranties set forth in Article IV and Article V), (i) the
Parties acknowledge and agree that neither the MLP Group Entities nor any
other Person has made, and the Buyer Group Entities are not relying upon, any
covenant, representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the MLP Group
Entities or as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
any MLP Group Entity furnished or made available to any Buyer Group Entity;
and (ii) the MLP Parties shall not have or be subject to any liability to any
Buyer Group Entity or any other Person, or any other remedy in connection
herewith, based upon the distribution to any Buyer Group Entity of, or any
Buyer Group Entitys use of or reliance on, any such information or any
information, documents or material made available to the Buyer Group Parties
in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time before or after
the MLP Unitholder Approval, but, after any such MLP Unitholder Approval was
obtained, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by
the unitholders of MLP without such further approval. No supplement,
modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in
writing by the Party to be bound thereby. The failure of a Party to exercise
any right or remedy shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver of such right
or remedy in the future. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof
(regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no amendment shall be made to Section 9.4, Section 9.5, Section 9.6
or Section 9.10 which would be adverse to the Financing Sources without the
prior written consent of such Financing Sources.

(c) Any amendments, supplements, waivers or modifications in respect of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.5 or any agreement to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 shall, in order to be effective, require, in
the case of Buyer, action by the Buyer Board with the prior consent
or recommendation of the Buyer Special Committee (or another committee to
which the Buyer Board has delegated decision making authority with respect to
the subject matter of such action) and, in the case of MLP, action by the MLP
Board (or a committee thereof to which the MLP Board has

 



89  delegated decision making authority with respect to the subject matter of
the amendment); _provided_ , _however_ , that no amendment of this Agreement
that changes the form of, reduces the amount of or extends the timing of
payment of, the Applicable Merger Consideration or alters the rights of the
MLP Conflicts Committee or Buyer Special Committee hereunder shall be
effective unless such amendment is also approved by the MLP Conflicts
Committee or Buyer Special Committee, as applicable.

SECTION 9.6 Binding Effect; No Third Party Beneficiaries; Assignment.

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

(b) None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of or
enforceable by any third Person, including any creditor of any Party or any of
their Affiliates, except (i) as provided in Section 6.11; (ii) as provided in
Section 9.8; (iii) for the Financing Sources and their respective current
former or future equity holders, controlling persons, Affiliates and
Representatives, which shall be third party beneficiaries of Section 9.4,
Section 9.5, Section 9.10 and this Section 9.6; and (iv) for the right of the
MLP Unitholders the right to receive the Applicable Merger Consideration
following the Effective Time and the right to be admitted as an Additional
Limited Partner of Buyer in connection therewith. No such third Person shall
obtain any right under any provision of this Agreement or shall by reason of
any such provision make any claim in respect of any liability (or otherwise)
against any Party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing
in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof or other Person, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement or a right in any employee or beneficiary of such employee or other
Person under any Employee Benefit Plan that such employee or beneficiary or
other Person would not otherwise have under the terms of such plan, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person
other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns,
any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder.

 

(c) No Party may assign, transfer, dispose of or otherwise alienate this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement
(whether by operation of law or otherwise). Any attempted assignment,
transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of this Agreement shall be
null, void and ineffective.

 

SECTION 9.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of applicable
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

 



90 SECTION 9.8 No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified
as Parties and no former, current or future equity holders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of any Party or
any former, current or future equity holder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties or for
any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of,
or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without
limiting the rights of any Party against the Other Parties, in no event shall
any Party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against,
make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover
monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party.

 

SECTION 9.9 Execution. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute
one instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by
facsimile or other customary means of electronic transmission (e.g., "pdf")
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.

SECTION 9.10 Certain Agreements with Respect to Financing Sources. The Parties
agree on behalf of themselves and their respective equity holders,
controlling persons, Affiliates, and Representatives (collectively, the "
_Related Parties_ ") that the Financing Sources and their and their respective
current former or future equity holders, controlling persons, Affiliates or
Representatives and each of their successors and assigns shall be subject to
no liability or claims by the Related Parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or in
connection with the Debt Financing, or the performance of services by such
Financing Sources or their Affiliates or Representatives with respect to the
foregoing; provided, however that nothing in this Section 9.10 shall limit
the rights that any Party would have pursuant to the Commitment Letters.
