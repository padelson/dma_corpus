the satisfaction of the Company Promissory Notes and Management Plan pursuant

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(2) Company Preferred Stock.

  

  

(i) Company Series A Preferred Stock. In addition to any payment pursuant to
Section 2.01(c)(II)(2)(vi) below, after payment in full of the amounts set
forth in Section 2.01(c)(I) above and after payment of Merger Consideration to
all other series of Company Preferred Stock, each issued and outstanding share
of Company Series A Preferred Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive that portion of the Merger Consideration as is equal to the

entitled to pursuant to the Company Charter, subject to any adjustment
contemplated by Sections 2.02 or 2.03 or Article IX of this Agreement.

  

  

(ii) Company Series B Preferred Stock. In addition to any payment pursuant to

forth in Section 2.01(c)(I) above and after payment of Merger Consideration to
the Company Series E Preferred Stock but prior to the payment of Merger
Consideration to the Company Series A Preferred Stock, the Company Series B
Preferred Stock and the Company Series C Preferred Stock, each issued and
outstanding share of Company Series D Preferred Stock shall be converted into
the right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration as is equal to
the liquidation preference that each share of Company Series D Preferred Stock

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(vi) Participation. In addition to the foregoing, each share of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D

(3) The Merger Consideration to be received by each Stockholder in exchange
for all of such Stockholder's shares of Company Capital Stock or Company
Promissory Notes is set forth on the Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule
delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and consists of a pro rata portion of
Stock Consideration and an interest in the Note. The Merger Consideration
shall be delivered to the Stockholders in accordance with Sections 2.04 and
2.05. As of the Effective Time, all issued and outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Capital Stock or of a
Company Promissory Note shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.05, without interest.

  

  

(4) The aggregate, then-outstanding principal amount of the Notes may be
satisfied in full by the issuance and delivery of 7,984,281 shares of Parent
Common Stock (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend or other
recapitalization or restructuring of the Parent Common Stock) upon approval by
the stockholders of the Parent of the conversion of the Note into shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Note prior to March 1,
2011 (subject to extension as set forth in the Note, the "Note Maturity Date")
in accordance with the provisions hereof and as set forth therein (the "Note
Satisfaction"). As soon as commercially practicable but in any event no later
than three Business Days following the Note Satisfaction, Parent will cause
the Escrow and Exchange Agent to deliver to the Stockholders the Note
Satisfaction Shares in accordance with the Exchange Agreement.

  

  

(5) The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause all outstanding
warrants to purchase Company Capital Stock to be cancelled at or prior to the
Effective Time and such warrants shall have no right to receive any Merger
Consideration and shall have no right to convert into Parent Capital Stock.

  

  

(d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any person who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares ("Appraisal Shares")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL
("Section 262") shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided
in Section 2.01(c) and shall not have any rights to receive any Escrow Funds,
but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the
fair market value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262;
provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of the fair market
value under Section 262 then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
market value of such holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate formerly representing such shares. The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.02. Determination of Company Estimated Net Working Capital and
Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have delivered to Parent a
statement certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (the
"Company Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth the Company's reasonable,
good faith estimate of the Company Net Working Capital (the "Company Estimated
Net Working Capital"). Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Parent shall
discuss the estimates set forth in the Company Estimated Closing Statement and
make revisions thereto as they may mutually agree. The Company Estimated
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the Company Financial Statements, except
for those adjustments to Net Working Capital that are set forth on Section
10.03 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(b) Parent shall deposit into the Escrow Account out of the Notes and in
addition to the Indemnity Escrow Funds, a principal amount of Notes (the
"Working Capital Escrow Funds") having a value equal to the difference between
the Company Net Working Capital Target and the Company Estimated Net Working
Capital multiplied by the Conversion Premium (if, and only if, the Company
Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Company Net Working Capital
Target). If the Company Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the
Company Net Working Capital Target, no adjustments shall be made and no
principal amount out of the Notes shall be deposited into the Escrow Account
as Working Capital Escrow Funds. The term "Company Net Working Capital Target"
shall have the meaning set forth on Section 2.02 of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

  

  

Section 2.03. Determination of Company Closing Net Working Capital and
Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Within forty-five (45) calendar days following the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause PricewaterhouseCoopers ("PWC") to prepare and deliver to the
Stockholders Representative and Parent a statement (the "Company Closing
Statement"), setting forth PWC's determination of Company Net Working Capital.
The Company Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Company Financial
Statements, except for those adjustments to Net Working Capital that are set
forth on Section 10.03 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Following receipt of the Company Closing Statement, the Stockholders
Representative will be afforded a period of forty-five (45) calendar days (the
"Company 45-Day Period") to review the Company Closing Statement. At or before
the end of the Company 45-Day Period, the Stockholders Representative may
either (i) accept the Company Closing Statement, and the computation of
Company Net Working Capital, in its entirety, or (ii) deliver to Parent a
written notice (the "Company Objection Notice") containing a reasonably
detailed written explanation of those items in the Company Closing Statement
which the Stockholders Representative disputes, in which case the items
specifically identified by the Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to
be in dispute. The failure by the Stockholders Representative to deliver the
Company Objection Notice within the Company 45-Day Period shall constitute the
Stockholders Representative's acceptance of the Company Closing Statement and
the computation of Company Net Working Capital, in its entirety. If the
Stockholders Representative delivers the Company Objection Notice in a timely
manner, then, within a further period of thirty (30) calendar days from the
end of the Company 45-Day Period, the parties and, if desired, their
accountants will attempt to resolve in good faith any disputed items and reach
a written agreement (the "Company Settlement Agreement") with respect thereto.
Failing such resolution, the unresolved disputed items will be referred for
final binding resolution to a mutually agreeable, nationally recognized
accounting firm with whom neither Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, the Stockholders Representative nor any of their
respective affiliates has had a material relationship during the eighteen
(18)-month period prior to the date hereof, which such firm will be mutually
agreed upon as promptly as practicable, or such other persons as the parties
may mutually agree (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), the fees and expenses of
which shall be allocated to and borne by the Stockholders Representative and
Parent based on the inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Arbitrator's
determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total
unresolved disputed items as originally submitted to the Accounting
Arbitrator. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000
and the Accounting Arbitrator awards $600 in favor of the Stockholders
Representative's position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by
Parent and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Stockholders Representative.
The Accounting Arbitrator shall be given reasonable access to all relevant
records to calculate the Company Net Working Capital. Such determination by
the Accounting Arbitrator (the "Company Net Working Capital Determination")
shall be (i) in writing, (ii) furnished to the parties as soon as practicable
after the items in dispute have been referred to the Accounting Arbitrator,
(iii) made in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
preparation of the Company Financial Statements, except for those adjustments
to Net Working Capital that are set forth on Section 10.03 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and (iv) nonappealable and incontestable by the parties
hereto and each of their respective affiliates and successors and assigns and
not subject to collateral attack for any reason other than manifest error or
fraud. As used herein "Company Closing Net Working Capital" means the Company
Net Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with this Section
2.03.

  

  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Company Determination Date" shall
mean the earliest to occur of (i) the forty-sixth (46th) day following the
receipt by the Stockholders Representative of the Company Closing Statement if
the Stockholders Representative shall have failed to deliver the Company
Objection Notice to Parent within the Company 45-Day Period, (ii) the date on
which either Parent or the Stockholders Representative gives the other a
written notice to the effect that such party has no objection to the other
party's determination of the Company Closing Statement, (iii) the date on
which Parent and the Stockholders Representative execute and deliver a Company
Settlement Agreement and (iv) the date as of which Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall have received the Company Net Working Capital
Determination.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) If the Company Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Company Net
Working Capital Target, then payment of the difference between the Company Net
Working Capital Target and the Company Closing Net Working Capital (the
"Company Shortfall") shall, within three (3) business days after the Company
Determination Date, be paid by the Stockholders to Parent. Parent shall first
recover the Company Shortfall from the Working Capital Escrow Funds (and if
recovery is to be a portion of the Note, then the principal amount of the Note
so recovered shall be equal to the Company Shortfall multiplied by the
Conversion Premium). If the Working Capital Escrow Funds are not sufficient to
cover the Company Shortfall then Parent shall have the right to first recover
the Company Shortfall (less the Working Capital Escrow Funds received pursuant
to this Section), calculated in accordance with the preceding sentence,
directly from the Indemnity Escrow Funds and, if the Indemnity Escrow Funds
are not sufficient, from the Stockholders for their Pro Rata Share of such
amount from the principal amount of the Note received pursuant to the Merger
(and if any recovery of the Company Shortfall pursuant to this sentence shall
be a portion of the Note, then the principal amount of the Note so recovered
shall be equal to the portion of the Company Shortfall being recovered
multiplied by the Conversion Premium). If the Working Capital Escrow Funds are
in excess of the value of the Company Shortfall, then such excess shall be
distributed to the Stockholders in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(e) If the Company Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Company Net
Working Capital Target, then the Company shall not be entitled to any
additional payment. Furthermore, if there is no Company Shortfall, then the
Working Capital Escrow Funds shall be distributed to the Stockholders in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.04. Escrow and Exchange Agent, Escrow Agreement and Exchange
Agreements.

  

  

(a) Parent will deposit with the Escrow and Exchange Agent immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (i) the Notes, minus the principal amount of Notes
comprising the Escrow Funds, (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Stock Consideration issuable to the Stockholders
pursuant to this Article II in the Merger, and (iii) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares as provided by Section 2.05(e) (collectively, the "Closing
Disbursement"). Such Closing Disbursement will be placed by the Escrow and
Exchange Agent in a separate account under the Exchange Agent Agreement (the
"Exchange Fund") for disbursement as set forth in Section 2.04(e) and Section
2.01. Parent shall also make available to the Exchange Agent, in addition to
the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.05(e). At the Closing,
Parent will deliver to the Stockholder Representative the Note to hold on
behalf of the Stockholders and each Stockholder's proportionate interest in
the Note set forth on the Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule shall not
vest until such Stockholder has surrendered all of its Company Capital Stock
and Company Promissory Note, if any, pursuant to a properly executed Letter of
Transmittal delivered to the Escrow and Exchange Agent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) In the event the stockholders of Parent approve the Note Satisfaction on
or before the Note Maturity Date, Parent will make available to the Escrow and
Exchange Agent, as soon as commercially practicable but in any event no later
than three business days after the date of the approval of the Note
Satisfaction, that number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the
Note Satisfaction (the "Note Satisfaction Shares" and with the Stock
Consideration, the "Shares"), for disbursement as set forth in this Article
II.

  

  

(c) In the event the stockholders of Parent fail to approve the Note
Satisfaction at the Parent Stockholders Meeting or on or before the Note
Maturity Date, Parent will deposit with the Escrow and Exchange Agent an
amount in cash equal to the principal amount of the Note as soon as
commercially practicable but in any event no later than three business days
after the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting at which the stockholders of
Parent failed to approve the Note Satisfaction and in all events on or before
the Note Maturity Date, for payment as set forth in this Article II, which
amount will be paid to the Stockholder Representative in satisfaction of the
Note in full for disbursement to the Stockholders in accordance with their Pro
Rata Share.

  

  

(d) Concurrently with the Closing, and pursuant to applicable provisions of
the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow and Exchange Agent will establish an escrow
account (the "Escrow Account") to hold the Indemnity Escrow Funds and the
Working Capital Escrow Funds, if any (collectively, the "Escrow Funds"), in
trust pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, which funds will be payable to the
Stockholders or Parent, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. On the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit in the Escrow Account out of the Notes a principal amount of Notes
equal to (i) $3,764,021.98 (the "Indemnity Escrow Funds") and (ii) the Working
Capital Escrow Funds, if any.

  

  

(e) Promptly after each of the Effective Time and the earlier of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting or the Note Maturity Date, as the case may be, Parent
will issue or pay, or will cause the Escrow and Exchange Agent to issue or
pay, to the Stockholders the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
set forth on the Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule in accordance with
Sections 2.01 and 2.05(b) and other applicable provisions of this Agreement,
the Exchange Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.05. Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Exchange Procedures. The following exchange procedures will govern the
exchange of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock at or following
the Effective Time:

  

  

(i) Attached as Annex E hereto is a spreadsheet setting forth (I) the name of
each Stockholder as of the Closing Date, (II) the number of shares and stock
certificate numbers of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock held by
such Stockholder as of the Effective Time, (III) the aggregate principal
amount and accrued but unpaid interest on each Company Promissory Note held by
such Stockholder as of the Effective Time, (IV) the portion of the Merger
Consideration and the Closing Disbursement issuable and payable to such
Stockholder in accordance with the provisions hereof as of the Closing Date,
(V) each Stockholder's proportional interest in the Escrow Fund and (VI) each
Stockholder's Pro Rata Share (such spreadsheet, the "Merger Consideration
Allocation Schedule"), all as determined in accordance with Section 2.01 of
this Agreement. The Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule will be appended
as an appropriately numbered exhibit to the Exchange Agent Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. 
 

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later
than five business days thereafter, Parent will mail, or will cause the Escrow
and Exchange Agent to mail, to each Stockholder who did not deliver a Letter
of Transmittal at the Effective Time at the respective addresses set forth on
the Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule the following: (I) a letter of
transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex F (the "Letter
of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Escrow and Exchange Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Stockholders Representative
may agree to specify) and (II) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration, which shall be
attached to the Letter of Transmittal.

  


 

  

(b) Surrender of Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate and a Company
Promissory Note, as the case may be, for cancellation to the Escrow and
Exchange Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Escrow and Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificate and Company Promissory Note, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that portion of the
Merger Consideration set forth on the Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule
(together with cash in lieu of fractional shares) that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the
Certificate and Company Promissory Note, as the case may be, so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until such time as (i) a holder of a Certificate
and a Company Promissory Note shall have duly executed and delivered a Letter
of Transmittal to Parent or the Escrow and Exchange Agent in respect of such
Certificate and Company Promissory Note and (ii) that portion of the Merger
Consideration set forth on the Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule is
issued to or at the direction of the holder of a surrendered Certificate or
Company Promissory Note, such Merger Consideration that would be issuable to
the holder of such Certificate or Company Promissory Note shall not be issued
to such holder, shall not be deemed not outstanding and shall not be entitled
to vote on any matter. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Capital Stock or Company Promissory Note that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Company
Promissory Note so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate or Company
Promissory Note shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of the Merger Consideration to
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Company
Promissory Note or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.05, each Certificate or Company Promissory Note shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.05. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of any Certificate or Company
Promissory Note.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Certificate formerly
representing Company Capital Stock or Company Promissory Note with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant
to Section 2.05(e), until the surrender of such Certificate or Company
Promissory Note in accordance with this Article II. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificate or Company Promissory Note, there
shall be paid to the holder of the Certificate or Company Promissory Note
representing the Merger Consideration issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock that are included in
the Merger Consideration that is payable to such holder, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock that are included in the Merger Consideration
that is payable to such holder.

  

  

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The Merger
Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of this Article
II upon conversion of any shares of Company Capital Stock shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Capital Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or
made by the Company on such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock or Company
Promissory Notes are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

  

  

(e) No Fractional Shares.

  

  

(1) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued at the Effective Time or upon the Note Satisfaction, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of this Section
2.05(e), all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be
entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three
decimal places.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(2) In lieu of any such remaining fractional shares after aggregation as set
forth above, each holder of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash,
without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (A) the
amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled under Section 2.01(c) (or would be entitled but
for this Section 2.05(e)) and (B) the Average VWAP of the Parent Common Stock.

  

  

(3) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Company Capital Stock in lieu of any fractional
share interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts, without interest, to the holders of Company Capital
Stock entitled to receive such cash.

  

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Escrow and Exchange Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate (i) to provide an affidavit of such loss, theft or
destruction in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Escrow and Exchange Agent
and any additional documentation reasonably requested by the Escrow and
Exchange Agent, (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless Parent from and against
any claim that may be made against Parent or its affiliates with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and/or (iii)
to provide a sufficient indemnity bond in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Escrow and Exchange Agent. It is understood and agreed
that the Company Promissory Notes were issued as .pdf files in electronic form
without original execution copies, and that a Company Promissory Note may be
surrendered by delivering a printed copy of the .pdf file embodying such
Company Promissory Note.

  

  

(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Capital Stock for twelve
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holder of Company Capital Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.05(c).

  

  

(h) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Stockholders
Representative or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect
of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate or Company Promissory Note has not been surrendered prior to three
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which Merger Consideration or any dividends or distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.05(c) in respect of such
Certificate or Company Promissory Note would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Company Promissory Note shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

  

  

(j) Securities Law Compliance. The Stock Consideration, the Note and, if
applicable, the Note Satisfaction Shares will be issued in a transaction
exempt from registration under the Securities Act by reason of Section 4(2)
thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and may not
be re-offered or resold other than in conformity with the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and such other applicable rules and
regulations or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock and the Note will be legended as
follows:

  

  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS [CERTIFICATE]/[NOTE] HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT") AND MAY
NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF UNLESS THEY HAVE BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR UPON RECEIPT BY AUTHENTEC, INC. OF AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT SOME OTHER EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT IS AVAILABLE."

  


 

  

Such certificates will also include such additional legends as necessary to
comply with applicable foreign, federal and state securities laws. The
certificates representing the Shares will be subject to a stop transfer order
with the Parent's transfer agent that restricts the transfer of such Shares
except in compliance with this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement.

and stockholders or members, as the case may be, of the Company and each

Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and by the delivery of the
Required Consent immediately after the execution and delivery hereto, the

Section 3.05. No Conflicts; Consents.

  

  

(a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and each

the Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and
thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon the Company Capital Stock, or the

the properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, (i)
any provision of the Company Charter, Company Bylaws or the comparable charter

Company Capital Stock.

  

  

(e) Each Accredited Stockholder understands that the offer and sale of the
Parent Common Stock, the Note and the Note Satisfaction Shares, if any, to be
issued pursuant to the Merger has not been registered under the Securities
Act. Each Accredited Stockholder also understands that the Parent Common
Stock, the Note and the Note Satisfaction Shares, if any, is being offered and
sold pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in the Securities
Act. Each Accredited Stockholder is acquiring the Parent Common Stock, the
Note and the Note Satisfaction Shares, if any, for its own account for
investment only, and not with a view towards its distribution in violation of
the Securities Act. Each Accredited Stockholder represents that by reason of
its, or of its management's, business or financial experience, it has the
capacity to protect its own interests in connection with the Merger and the
other Transactions. Each Accredited Stockholder is an accredited investor
within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Each Accredited
Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the shares of the Parent Common
Stock, the Note and the Note Satisfaction Shares, if any, issued pursuant to
the Merger are "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act as in effect from time to time and must be held
indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act

this effect.

held by such Stockholder as of the Effective Time, (III) the aggregate
principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on each Company Promissory
Note held by such Stockholder as of the Effective Time, (IV) the portion of
the Merger Consideration and the Closing Disbursement issuable and payable to
such Stockholder in accordance with the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws
and other related instruments and Article II of this Agreement as of the
Closing Date, (V) each Stockholder's proportional interest in the Escrow Fund
and (VI) each Stockholder's Pro Rata Share. The aggregate outstanding
principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on all Company Promissory
Notes is set forth on the Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule.
Furthermore, all outstanding warrants to purchase Company capital stock will
expire at the Effective Time and will not result in any rights to receive
Company Capital Stock or the Merger Consideration.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 3.06. Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities.

  

  

(a) The consolidated financial statements of the Company set forth in Section
3.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Company Financial Statements")
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and except that
such unaudited statements do not contain footnote disclosures) and are in
accordance with the books and records of such entities, which have been
properly maintained and are complete and correct in all material respects.

  

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any material
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries or in the notes
thereto, other than liabilities that have arisen in the ordinary course of
business since the date of the last balance sheet contained in the Company
Financial Statements (the "Company Balance Sheet Date").

  

  

(c) None of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries is, or at any time has
been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

  

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any outstanding
Indebtedness.

  

  

Section 3.07. Accounts Receivable; Inventories.

  

  

(a) The accounts receivable reflected in the Company Financial Statements, and
all accounts receivable arising since the date of the Company Balance Sheet,
arose from bona fide transactions in the ordinary course of business. On a
consolidated basis, the accounts receivable reflected in the Company Financial
Statements have been properly recorded and reserved against, in all material
respects, in accordance with GAAP and consistent with past practice. Except as
set forth in Section 3.07 of the Company Disclosure Letter, no such account
receivable has been assigned or pledged to any other person, firm or
corporation or is subject to any right of set-off other than in the ordinary
course of business and for which adequate reserves are reflected in the
Company Financial Statements.

  

  

(b) All material items of inventory of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, all material items of inventory
held by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary at distributors
or other resellers in the Company's or any Company Subsidiary's distribution
channels (regardless of title), will, at the Effective Time, consist of items
of a quality and quantity usable and saleable in the ordinary course of
business and conform to generally accepted standards in the Company's
industry. Since the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in the
Company Financial Statements, no inventory has been sold or disposed of,
except through use or sale in the ordinary course of business.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 3.08. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company for inclusion in (i) any registration statement on
Form S-3 that may be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") by Parent in connection with the resale of the Parent Common Stock to
be issued pursuant to Article II (the "Form S-3") will, at the time the Form
S-3 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the proxy statement relating to the
approval of the Note Satisfaction by Parent's stockholders (the "Proxy
Statement") will, at the date it is first mailed to Parent's stockholders or
at the time of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

  

  

Section 3.09. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. From the Company Balance
Sheet Date to the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 3.09
of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has conducted its business only
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, and during
such period there has not been:

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

(ii) any redemption or repurchase, directly or indirectly, of any shares of

Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all
its material properties and assets except for defects in title, easements,
restrictive covenants and similar encumbrances or impediments that, in the
aggregate, do not and will not materially interfere with its ability to
conduct its business in a manner consistent with past practices. All such
assets and properties, other than assets and properties in which the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries has leasehold interests, are free and clear
of all Liens, except for Liens that, in the aggregate, do not and will not
materially interfere with the ability of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to conduct their business as currently conducted. The Company and

current with respect to payments due under such leases, and (ii) has complied
in all material respects with their respective obligations under such leases.

no condition exists which, with the lapse of time or giving of notice, or
both, would give rise to a material default under any such lease by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or, to the Company's knowledge, any other
party to such lease.

  

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns any real property or
is obligated to acquire any real property. To the Company's knowledge, the

Company Disclosure Letter hereto permit the continued operation, use, and
occupancy of such Leased Real Property for the conduct of the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries substantially in accordance with past

any written notices of material violations of, any applicable zoning,
subdivision or building Law.

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, has canceled or otherwise terminated its
relationship with the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary and, to the
Company's knowledge, there are no facts, conditions or circumstances that
would reasonably be expected to cause a material customer or supplier of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to cancel or otherwise terminate
its relationship with the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary and, to
the Company's knowledge, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
taken any action that would have a material adverse effect on the continuity

condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)

by Parent, any of the Parent Subsidiaries or any escrow agent(s) or any other
person to any third party.

no charge.

accurate list of all of the Contracts of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
concerning the following matters (collectively, the "Parent Material
Contracts"): (i) any Contracts pursuant to which any indebtedness for borrowed
money of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries (in each case, in excess of

with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,

to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. Neither
Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is in material violation of or in
material default under (nor does there exist any condition which upon the
passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a violation of or
default under) any Parent Material Contract to which it is a party or by which
it or any of its properties or assets is bound. To Parent's knowledge, as of
the date hereof, there is no existing or claimed default by any other party to
any Parent Material Contract or event which with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a material default by any such party.

  

  

(c) None of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party to or is otherwise
bound by any Contract or covenant restricting the development, manufacturing,
marketing or distribution of Parent's or the Parent Subsidiaries' existing
business, products or services in a manner that would be material to Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

issuance of the Stock Consideration pursuant to the Merger does not require
the vote or approval of the holders of any class or series of Parent Capital
Stock, and only requires the filing with NASDAQ of a Notification Form:

the Merger (the "Nasdaq Listing Form").

the other Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent
or Sub.

be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary

Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iv) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to
fully carry out the purposes of the Transaction Agreements. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, the Company, Parent and their respective
boards of directors shall (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement and (y) if
any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Parent and the Company will make any and all filings required to be made
under any applicable antitrust Laws, if any, as promptly as practicable

Section 6.04. Stock Options.

  

  

(a) The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Company Stock Plans) shall have adopted such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that, effective as of the Effective
Time, each then outstanding Company Employee Stock Option, to the extent not
previously exercised, shall be cancelled.

  

  

(b) In this Agreement:

  

  

"Company Employee Stock Option" means any option to purchase Company Common
Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan.

  

  

"Company Stock Plans" means the plans listed on Section 6.04(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  

  

Section 6.05. Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Parent shall either (i) maintain or cause the Surviving Corporation (or in
the case of a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets and
businesses of the Surviving Corporation, its successors and assigns) to
maintain for a period of twelve months after the Effective Time the Company
Benefit Plans at the benefit levels in effect on the date of this Agreement or
(ii) provide or cause the Surviving Corporation (or, in such case, its
successors or assigns) to provide benefits to each current active employee of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are no less favorable than the
benefits being provided to similarly situated employees of Parent on the date
of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (including any severance
plan), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits and vesting, service with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (or any predecessor or employer of an employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, to the extent such service with such predecessor
employer is recognized by the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary)
shall be treated as service with Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
affiliates (other than the Company) in which employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitation would have been applicable under the
comparable Company welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of
all expenses incurred by each employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

  

  

(d) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Company and the Stockholders
Representative shall cause an aggregate of 279,269 shares of Parent Common
Stock to be granted to the vice presidents of the Company (in the amounts) set
forth on Section 6.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter out of the shares of
Parent Common Stock received by the Stockholders as part of the Stock
Consideration.

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement (i) shall require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to continue to employ any particular
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary following the Closing Date,
or (ii) subject to Section 6.05(b), shall be construed to prohibit Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any Company Benefit Plan. No provision of this Agreement shall
create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may be
provided to any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates or under any benefit plan
which any of them may maintain, or otherwise. No provision of this Agreement
shall operate as an amendment to any benefit plan maintained by the Company or
Parent or their respective subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 6.06. Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, honor and maintain
in effect, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and maintain in
effect, all of the Company's obligations to indemnify (including any
obligations to advance funds for expenses) the current or former directors or
officers of the Company for acts or omissions by such directors and officers
occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such obligations of
the Company exist on the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, individual indemnity agreements or
otherwise, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter, the
Company Bylaws and such individual indemnity agreements from the Effective
Time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of such
acts or omissions. Parent shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors or
officers of the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective
Time, a copy of which has been provided to Parent; provided, however, that
Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such
insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200% of the annual premiums paid
as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the "Current
Premium"). The Current Premium is disclosed on Section 6.06 of the Company
Disclosure Letter. If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or
can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of 200% of the Current
Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors'
and officers' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to 200% of the
Current Premium.

  

  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless (and comply with all of the Company's existing obligations
to advance funds for expenses to) the present and former officers and
directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and any employee of the Company
or its subsidiaries who acts as a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan
(each an "Indemnified Party") against all Losses, as incurred (payable monthly
upon written request which request shall include reasonable evidence of the
Losses set forth therein) to the extent arising from, relating to, or
otherwise in respect of, any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time in connection with such Indemnified Party's duties as an
officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including in
respect of this Agreement, any other Transaction Agreement, the Merger and the
other Transactions. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, set
forth in Section 6.06.

  

  

Section 6.07. Fees and Expenses. Except as provided below, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated.

  

  

Section 6.08. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the Merger and the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

  

  

Section 6.09. Stock Exchange Listing. On the Closing Date, Parent shall submit
to NASDAQ the Nasdaq Listing Form. After the Effective Time, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to
official notice of issuance, as soon as practicable. After the Effective Time,
in the event that the Note Satisfaction Shares are issued, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such shares of Parent Common Stock to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ as promptly as possible after the issuance
of such shares.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.10. Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent will have
the right to withhold all Taxes from payments to be made hereunder (including
any payments in connection with the Exchange Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement) if such withholding is required by Law, and to collect a FIRPTA
Certificate, in the form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, from the Company
and Forms W-8 or W-9 or other forms from the Stockholders to the extent
required by any foreign, federal, state or local laws; provided, however, that
Parent shall claim an exemption from FIRPTA withholding in the event it
receives a FIRPTA certificate from the Company, in the form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent. The parties intend that (i) the Merger will be treated
as a taxable transaction and not as a "reorganization" for federal income tax
purposes and (ii) all of the Merger Consideration will be treated for federal
income tax purposes as payments in exchange for the Company Capital Stock or
Company Promissory Notes owned by the Stockholders. The parties agree to
report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent
with that intent. Parent will take no action inconsistent with such intended
treatment, including merging the Company into Parent or any direct or indirect
subsidiary of Parent in connection with the Merger; provided, however, that in
no event will the approval of the Note Satisfaction be construed as an action
inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a taxable transaction.

  

  

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, all Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries due
after the Closing Date; provided, however, that with respect to any such Tax
Return that relates to income Taxes for a period, or portion thereof, ending
on or before the Closing Date, such Tax Returns shall be prepared, to the
extent of applicable Law, in a manner consistent with the Company's past
practice, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered, such Tax Return, together with supporting work papers, to the
Stockholders Representative not less than 30 days prior to the due date
(including all applicable extensions of time to file) of such Tax Return for
the Stockholders Representative's review and comment prior to filing. Any
disagreements between the Stockholders Representative, on the one hand, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the other hand, shall be resolved by
an independent accounting firm agreed upon by the Stockholders Representative,
on the one hand, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the other hand,
and the costs of expenses shall be borne equally by each. Parent shall not
amend any Tax Return of the Company with respect to a period, or portion
thereof, that ends on or prior to the Closing Date, without the consent of the
Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
unless Parent is required to amend such Tax Return pursuant to applicable Law.

  

  

(c) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have caused Upek Pte.
Ltd. to be in compliance with all local country financial and tax
requirements, including issuance of final statutory financial statements for
the 2007 and 2008 years, and the filing of all required income and indirect
Tax Returns and reports due on any date before the Closing Date. The Company
shall have provided written evidence of such compliance and filings to Parent
on or prior to the Closing Date

of the Parent Board at and after the Effective Time to reflect the size and
composition of the Parent Board agreed upon in the Stockholders Agreement.

  

  

(b) Subject to any actions of the Parent Board to the contrary, the officers
of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain the officers of
Parent immediately after the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 6.12. Required Consent. The Company, promptly following receipt by the
Company of the Required Consent, shall deliver to Parent a certificate of the
Secretary of the Company certifying that the Required Consent has been
obtained by written consent in compliance with the Company Charter, Company
Bylaws and the DGCL.

  

  

Section 6.13. Intentionally Omitted and Reserved .

  

  

Section 6.14. Intercompany Agreements. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Company shall provide all transfer pricing studies and
other documentation that Parent may reasonably request with respect to the
Contracts set forth on Section 6.14 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

Section 9.03. Calculation of Losses. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall be reduced to take
account of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the indemnified party
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss. In computing the
amount of any such Tax benefit, the indemnified party shall be deemed to
recognize all other items of income, gain, loss deduction or credit before
recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment
hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss. Parent and the
Stockholders Representative agree to treat any indemnification payments
received pursuant to this Agreement for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to
the purchase price to the extent permitted by applicable Law. To the extent
that the amount of any Loss is included in the calculation of Company Net
Working Capital, such included amount of any such Loss shall not also be
recoverable under this Article IX. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, to the extent any Losses are satisfied by the retirement of
all or any portion of the Note, including any Note in the Escrow Account, the
amount of such Losses shall be multiplied by the Conversion Premium and
satisfied by the retirement of a principal amount of the Note in an amount
equal to the amount of the Loss multiplied by the Conversion Premium.

  

  

Section 9.04. Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless any party, pursuant to Section 9.01(a) or 9.02(a), are subject
to the condition that the indemnifying party shall have received written
notice of the Losses for which indemnity is sought within eighteen (18) months
after the Closing Date (the "Escrow Termination Date"); provided, however,
that, any indemnification obligations resulting from a breach of the
representations and warranties made in (i) Sections 3.10 (Taxes), Section 3.15
(Environmental Laws) and 4.09 (Taxes) shall survive until thirty (30) calendar
days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations for
assertions by third parties (including, without limitation, any Governmental
Authority) of claims that would give rise to a claim for indemnification under
such sections hereunder and (ii) the Company Fundamental Representations and
the Parent Fundamental Representations shall survive indefinitely; provided,
further, that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified
shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period referenced above,
previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in
reasonable detail the basis of such claim) pursuant to Section 9.05 to the
party to be providing the indemnification.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.05. Procedures.

  

  

(a) In order for either Parent or the Stockholders Representative (on behalf
of the Stockholders) (the "indemnified party"), to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a claim made by any person against the indemnified party (a
"Third Party Claim"), such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying
party (the "indemnifying party") in writing (which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail, the events giving rise to such Third Party Claim, that the
indemnified party has accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to
pay or accrue Losses, the amount of such Losses or reasonably anticipated
Losses, and the specific representation, warranty or covenant on which such
claim is based) of the Third Party Claim within ten (10) business days after
receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter,
the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five
business days' time after the indemnified party's receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified
party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  

  

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however,
that if the indemnified party reasonably believes, upon advice of counsel,
there exists an actual conflict of interest between the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party such that representation of both the indemnifying party
and the indemnified party would be inappropriate, then the indemnified party
may retain counsel of its own choice and the indemnifying party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. If the
indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the
indemnifying party shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has not
assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the
indemnified party shall have failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim as
provided above). If the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a
Third Party Claim, all the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the indemnifying party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without
the indemnifying party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall agree
to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the
indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in
connection with such Third Party Claim and that would not otherwise materially
adversely affect the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if
(i) the indemnifying party does not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within fifteen
(15) days from receipt of notice of such a Third Party Claim by indemnified
party, or (ii) the indemnifying party assumes the defense of the Third Party
Claim and, in the reasonable opinion of the indemnified party, fails to
diligently prosecute such defense, and after delivery by the indemnified party
of ten (10) business days advance notice to the indemnifying party alleging
such failure to diligently prosecute, the indemnifying party shall not have
modified the defense of such Third Party Claim so that it would be reasonably
considered to be diligently prosecuting such defense, then the indemnified
party shall have the right to control the defense or settlement of any such
Third Party Claim or demand that its reasonable costs and expenses shall be
included as part of the indemnification obligation of the indemnifying party
or (B) if legal counsel for the indemnified party reasonably believes that
there are or may be legal defenses available to the indemnified party which
are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party,
then the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall jointly coordinate
the defense of such Third Party Claim. Furthermore, if in the reasonable
opinion of the indemnified party (x) any such Third Party Claim or the
litigation or resolution of any such Third Party Claim involves an issue or
matter that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the indemnified party, including the dispute with a customer listed in Section
3.22 of the Company Disclosure Letter and Section 4.15 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter or one of Parent's or the Company's top ten suppliers by
dollar value for 2009 or 2010 (through the date of this Agreement), or (y) the
Third Party Claim could reasonably be expected to result in an award of
injunctive relief against the indemnified party, the indemnified party shall
have the right to control the defense or settlement of any such Third Party
Claim and its reasonable costs and expenses shall be included as part of the
indemnification obligation of the indemnifying party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Other Claims. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 9.01 or 9.02 that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of
such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. The failure
by any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve
the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to such indemnified
party under Section 9.01 or 9.02, except to the extent that the indemnifying
party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure. If
the indemnifying party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of competent jurisdiction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.06. Release from Escrow Account.

  

  

(a) In the event either Parent or the Stockholders Representative, as an
indemnified party, shall have, prior to the expiration of the Escrow
Termination Date, delivered a notice of a claim (a "Pending Claim") in respect
of indemnification hereunder to the Stockholder Representative or Parent, as
the indemnifying party, such indemnified party and such indemnifying party
shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement with respect to (i) such
indemnified party's right to indemnification hereunder and the amount of such
indemnified party's Losses and (ii) in the event Parent is the indemnified
party, the portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account that
should be reserved for, and in the event the Stockholders are the indemnified
party, the amount of cash that should be reserved for on the Parent Financial
Statements (collectively, the "Reserve Amount") in respect of such Pending
Claim prior to resolution of the matters in respect thereof described in
clause (i). If they are unable so to reach agreement any such dispute shall,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, be resolved by litigation in an
appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. Pending a resolution of the
Reserve Amount in respect of any claim, the Reserve Amount therefor shall be
the amount of Losses asserted in good faith by the indemnified party in
respect of such Pending Claim.

  

  

(b) In the event Parent is the indemnified party, upon the resolution of the
amount of the Parent's Losses in respect of any Pending Claim, if any, the
Stockholders Representative shall instruct the Escrow and Exchange Agent under
the Escrow Agreement to deliver to Parent a portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Funds equal to the amount of such Losses and, (i) in the event that the
portion of Indemnity Escrow Funds being delivered is a Note, the Escrow and
Exchange Agent shall deliver to Parent from the Indemnity Escrow Funds a Note
for cancellation with a principal amount equal to the amount of such Losses
multiplied by the Conversion Premium and (ii) in the event that, following the
Note Satisfaction, the portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds being delivered
pursuant to this Section are Note Satisfaction Shares, the Escrow and Exchange
Agent shall deliver to Parent from the Indemnity Escrow Funds that number of
Note Satisfaction Shares equal to (X) the total number of Note Satisfaction
Shares that would be in the Indemnity Escrow Account (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement) if the entire principal amount of the Note initially placed in the
Indemnity Escrow Account converted into the Note Satisfaction Shares
multiplied by (Y) the Escrow Percentage; provided, however, that at the
election of the Stockholders Representative in its sole discretion, the
Stockholders may satisfy any such Losses by paying cash to Parent within 30
days of resolution of the amount of such Losses, in accordance with their Pro
Rata Share, in the amount of such Losses, in lieu of the Escrow Agent
delivering to Parent such principal amount of the Note pursuant to clause (i)
above or such number of Note Satisfaction Shares pursuant to clause (ii)
above, as applicable, whereupon such principal amount of the Note or such
number of Note Satisfaction Shares shall be released to the Stockholders after
such cash payment to Parent has been made. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, in the event that any Losses result from a breach of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.06(d) of this
Agreement, Parent in its sole discretion shall have the right to recover the
amount of such Losses directly from the Stockholders, in accordance with their
Pro Rata Share, or from the Indemnity Escrow Funds. If the Parent elects to
recover such Losses from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, the Stockholders shall be
obligated to deposit with the Escrow and Exchange Agent the same amount of
cash, principal amount of the Note or number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
as the case may be, to be held in the Escrow Account that was distributed to
Parent in satisfaction of such Losses resulting from the breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.06(d) of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) In the event that the Stockholders are the indemnified party, upon the
resolution of the amount of the Stockholders' Losses in respect of any Pending
Claim, if any, Parent shall wire to the Stockholder Representative in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the amount of such Losses for
distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share;
provided, however, that at the election of Parent in its sole discretion,
Parent may satisfy any such Losses by issuing a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to the Stockholders Representative, within 30 days of the
resolution of the amount of such Losses, as would be equal to the amount of
such Losses divided by the Average VWAP of the Parent Common Stock, for
distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Share.

  

  

(d) Promptly following the Escrow Termination Date, and promptly following the
resolution of any Pending Claims with respect to any Reserve Amounts, the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall instruct the Escrow and Exchange
Agent under the Escrow Agreement to deliver to the Exchange Agent for
distribution to the Stockholders, in accordance with their Pro Rata Share, the
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds equal to (i) the Indemnity Escrow Funds
remaining in the Escrow Account at such time, minus (ii) the sum of all
Reserve Amounts outstanding at such time.

  

  

Section 9.07. Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement:

  

  

(a) To the extent that the Stockholders and/or Parent shall have any
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any other person hereunder, such
obligation shall not include lost profits or other consequential, special,
punitive, incidental or indirect damages (and the injured party shall not
recover for such amounts), other than to the extent any such damages are
asserted by a third party against an indemnified party in a Third Party Claim.

  

  

(b) Parent and the Stockholders Representative, acting on behalf of the
Stockholders, shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any
claim or liability that may lead to Losses hereunder including by making
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or
liability.

  

  

(c) Parent and the Stockholders Representative, acting on behalf of the
Stockholders, further acknowledge and agree that, other than (i) the
representations and warranties of the Company and the Stockholders contained
in Article III of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the
covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, and (ii) the representations and warranties of Parent and Sub
contained in Article IV of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
and the covenants of Parent and Sub contained in this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, there are no representations, warranties or covenants
of the Company, the Stockholders Representative, the Stockholders or Parent
and Sub, as the case may be, either expressed or implied, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements. Each of the parties hereto hereby acknowledges and agrees that in
connection with the transactions set forth herein, Parent and the Company have
received certain estimates, projections, forecasts and similar forward-looking
statements relating to the future operating and financial performance of the
other party and no representation or warranty is being made by or on behalf of
either party with respect to such matters.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
party shall have any right to indemnification under this Article IX with
respect to any Losses to the extent (and only to the extent) such Losses (i)
arise primarily out of any action or inaction of such party; (ii) arise solely
out of changes after the Closing Date in applicable Law or interpretations or
applications thereof; or (iii) are duplicative of Losses that have previously
been recovered hereunder.

  

  

(e) Upon payment in full of any claim arising under Section 9.05(c) (an
"Inter-Party Claim"), pursuant to such Section 9.05(c) or the payment of any
judgment with respect to a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.05, the
indemnifying party shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to the
rights of the indemnified party against any person with respect to the subject
matter of such Inter-Party Claim or Third Party Claim, unless the indemnified
party has a continuing commercial relationship with the counterparty to the
Third Party Claim or Inter-Party Claim (other than any insurance company that
has issued an insurance policy that is applicable to such Third Party Claim or
Inter-Party Claim). The indemnified party shall assign or otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the indemnifying party to assign, at the cost and expense of
the indemnified party, any and all rights to pursue any claims against, or
otherwise recover amounts from, any person liable or responsible for any
Losses for which indemnification has been received pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.08. Exclusive Remedy. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent or the Stockholders
after the Closing with respect to any and all claims relating to this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements, the Merger and the other
Transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX; provided, however,
this exclusive remedy does not preclude (i) a party from bringing an action
for specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Agreements or (ii) a party from pursuing remedies under applicable Law for
fraud or intentional misrepresentation against the party committing the fraud
or intentional misrepresentation. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or intentional
misrepresentation against the party who committed such fraud or intentional
misrepresentation) it may have against the Stockholders or Parent,
respectively, arising under or based upon any applicable Law or arising under
or based upon common law or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article IX or an action for specific performance
or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Agreements).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.09. Stockholders Representative. By virtue of the approval of the
Merger and this Agreement by the Stockholders, each of the Stockholders shall
be deemed to have agreed to appoint the Stockholders Representative as its
agent and attorney-in-fact and as stockholder representative, for and on
behalf of the Stockholders to hold the Note for the account of the
Stockholders in accordance with the Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule,
to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to any
Parent indemnified party from the Escrow Account in satisfaction of claims by
any Parent indemnified party, to object to such payments, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Parent indemnified party
against any Stockholder or by any such Stockholder against any indemnified
party or any dispute between any indemnified party and any such Stockholder,
in each case relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and to take all
other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement, including in connection
with the determination of the Company Estimated Net Working Capital and the
Company Closing Net Working Capital and the payment of any Company Shortfall
in Sections 2.03, 2.04 and 2.05 of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed
by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days
prior written notice to Parent; provided, however, that the Stockholder
Representative may not be removed or any change to the agency made unless
holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Account agree to such removal
and to the identity of the substituted agent or such change. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be
filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Account. No bond
shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative shall not receive any compensation for his services. Notices or
communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute
notice to or from the Stockholders.
