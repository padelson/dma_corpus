                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION


         This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of June 21, 2000, by and among Ariba, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Eli Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Merger
Sub") and SupplierMarket.com Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company").

                                    RECITALS

         A. The Boards of Directors of Company, Parent and Merger Sub believe it
is in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders of their
respective companies that Company and Merger Sub combine into a single company
through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the "Merger")
and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger.

         B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, each outstanding share
of capital stock of Company, par value $.001 per share ("Company Capital
Stock"), shall be converted into shares of common stock of Parent, $0.002 par
value per share ("Parent Common Stock"), as provided below. Parent will assume
all outstanding options to purchase Company Capital Stock, all outstanding
warrants to purchase Company Capital Stock, and all other outstanding rights to
acquire Company Capital Stock, in each case whether or not contingent or earned,
as provided below.

         C. Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations and warranties and other agreements in connection with the
Merger.

         D. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of
the Code.

         E. In addition, as an inducement to Parent to enter into this
Agreement, Jonathan Burgstone and Asif Satchu (each a "Founder" and
collectively, the "Founders") each have entered into Stock Restriction
Agreements with Parent and each Key Company Employee (as defined in Section 5.9)
have entered into a Non-Competition Agreement with Parent.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations
set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER
                                   ----------

         1.1 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Certificate
of Merger attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the "Certificate of Merger") and the
applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"),
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into


<PAGE>

Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Parent. Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."

         1.2 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. Unless the Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to Article VII, the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby
(the "Closing") will take place as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or
waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof but in any event
no later than September 30, 2000 (the date on which the Closing shall occur, the
"Closing Date"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Gunderson
Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP, 155 Constitution Drive,
Menlo Park, California 94025. On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of Delaware Law (the time and date of such filing being the
"Effective Time" and the "Effective Date," respectively).

         1.3 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Company shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         1.4      CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS.

                  (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by Delaware Law and such Certificate of Incorporation;
provided, however, that Article I of such Certificate of Incorporation shall be
amended to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is SupplierMarket.com,
Inc."

                  (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended.

         1.5 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. At the Effective Time, the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, to hold office until such time as such directors resign,
are removed or their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office until such
time as such officers resign, are removed or their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified.

         1.6 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. The total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued ("Total Parent Shares") in exchange for the
acquisition by Parent of (i) all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) all unexpired and unexercised
options to purchase common stock of Company outstanding

                                       2


<PAGE>

immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Company Options"), (iii) all
unexpired and unexercised warrants to Purchase capital stock of Company
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Company Warrants") and
(iv) all other subscriptions, rights to purchase or commitments to issue
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
("Other Company Stock Rights") shall be equal to the sum of (w) 6,230,764 and
(x) the Additional Parent Shares (as defined in Section 1.9 hereof) less (y)
an amount of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (A) Expense Deductions
(as defined below) divided by (B) $68.20993 and less (z) the Company
Financial Advisory Fee Shares (as defined in Section 2.29) (the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock referred to in clauses (w),(x), and (y) and the
Share price referred to in clause (B) as appropriately adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations, reorganizations,
reclassifications and the like of such Parent Common Stock subsequent to the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time). The "Expense Deductions" shall
equal the sum of (i) the Company Financial Advisory Cash Fees (as defined in
Section 2.29), (ii) fifty percent (50%) of Company Professional Fees (as
defined in Section 2.29) under $500,000, and (iii) all Company Professional
Fees over $500,000, in each case as determined or estimated as of the Closing
upon receipt of an itemized invoice releasing Parent and the Surviving
Corporation from any further liability therefor from each service provider.
The Total Parent Shares shall be issuable in respect of Outstanding Company
Shares (as defined below) and, except as provided herein, no adjustment shall
be made in the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger,
including, without limitation, as a result of (x) any increase or decrease in
the market price of Parent Common Stock prior to the Effective Time, or (y)
any cash proceeds received by Company from the date hereof to the Closing
Date pursuant to the exercise of currently outstanding Company Options or
Company Warrants or pursuant to any Other Company Stock Rights.

         By virtue of the Merger, at the Effective Time, and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of Company's
securities:

                  (a) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK/EXCHANGE RATIO. Each
share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be exchanged into the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by dividing (i) the Total Parent Shares by (ii) the Outstanding
Company Shares, rounded to eight decimal points (the "Exchange Ratio").

                  (b) CANCELLATION OF COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK OWNED BY PARENT OR
COMPANY. All shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by Company as
treasury stock, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.

                  (c) COMPANY STOCK OPTION PLAN. Company's 1999 Stock Option
Plan (the "Company Stock Option Plan") and all Company Options then outstanding
under the Company Stock Option Plan, whether or not exercisable, shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.12.

                  (d) COMPANY WARRANTS. Each Company Warrant outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not contingent or earned,
which does not terminate by its terms at the Effective Time shall be converted
into warrants to acquire Parent

                                       3


<PAGE>

Common Stock in accordance with its terms. Each warrant so converted shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in
such warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such
warrant shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of shares Company Common Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time (without regard to vesting restrictions) multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
and rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such assumed warrant shall be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at
which such warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

                  (e) OTHER COMPANY STOCK RIGHTS. Each Other Company Stock Right
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not or
contingent or earned, shall be assumed by Parent. Each such right so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions set forth in such right immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that (i) such right shall represent that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable pursuant to such right immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
assumed option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

                  (f) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of Common Stock,
$.01 par value, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock"), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common
Stock, $.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of
Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         1.7 ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO. The number of shares to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.6 shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
stock split, reverse split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock
occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

         1.8 FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Capital

shall be equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company

the Effective Time, including shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of Company Preferred Stock (as defined in Section 2.2 below) prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of any Company Options outstanding immediately prior

of the sum of (I) an aggregate of 50% of the shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of any Company Options granted by the Company
pursuant to Section 5.27 hereof and (II) any Company Options cancelled or shares
of Company Common Stock repurchased by Company subsequent to the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time, and (B) shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of any Company Options granted by the Company pursuant to
Section 5.28 hereof shall not be considered Outstanding Company Shares, (iii)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the

Stock. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the assumption
of Company Options by Parent pursuant to this Agreement of the Company Options
referred to in clauses (A) (as modified by subclauses I and II) and (B) of the
immediately preceding sentence are referred to as the "Additional Parent
Shares."

         1.10     DISSENTING SHARES.

                  (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded
and perfected appraisal or dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with
Delaware Law and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or
lost such appraisal or dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are
granted by Delaware Law. Any Dissenting Shares shall be included for purposes of
determining the number of Outstanding Company Shares.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), if any
holder of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under
Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of the Effective Time
and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Parent Common Stock,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such
shares.

                  (c) Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received
by Company and (ii) Company

                                       5


<PAGE>

agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, or as required
under Delaware Law, it will not make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle any claim, demand, or other liability with respect to any
Dissenting Shares.

         1.11     SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.

                  (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Bank Boston, N.A. (or its successor) shall
act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

                  (b) PARENT TO PROVIDE COMMON STOCK. Promptly after the
Effective Time, but in any event within ten (10) business days, Parent shall
make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this
Article I, through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for shares
of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited into the Escrow
Fund (as defined in Section 8.3 hereof) pursuant to the requirements of Article
VIII hereof.

                  (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, whose shares were
converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon receipt of the Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in
such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock. In addition Parent shall cause to be mailed to Broadview International
LLC ("Broadview") a Certificate for the Company Financial Advisory Fee Shares in
accordance with instructions provided to Parent by Broadview which are
reasonably acceptable to Parent. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6, less the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder's behalf
pursuant to Article VIII hereof, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that,
prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than
the payment of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares
of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall
have been so converted. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3 hereof, Parent
shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 8.3
hereof) a certificate or certificates representing ten percent (10%) of the
Total Parent Shares ("Escrow Shares") which shall be registered in the name of
the Escrow Agent as nominee for the holders of Certificates cancelled pursuant
to this Section 1.11. The Escrow Shares shall be comprised entirely of Shares of
Parent Common Stock

                                       6


<PAGE>

that are not subject to any vesting restriction or repurchase right. The entire
portion of Escrow Shares shall be contributed in respect of Total Parent Shares
issuable to Former Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.6(a) other than
(A) such stockholders who acquired all of his or her shares of Company Capital
Stock via exercise of employee stock options issued by Company and (B) the
stockholder other than the Founders, who is an employee of the Company and
acquired all of his shares of Company Capital stock via a restricted stock grant
by the Company. Such shares shall be beneficially owned by such holders and
shall be held in escrow and shall be available to compensate Parent for certain
damages as provided in Article VIII. The Escrow Shares will appear as issued and
outstanding on Parent's balance sheet and will be legally outstanding under
applicable state law. All dividends paid on Escrow Shares (excluding any shares
of Parent Capital Stock paid in connection with a stock split or stock dividend)
will be distributed currently to each of the exchanging Former Company
Stockholders, and all voting rights of the Escrow Shares will be exercisable by
or on behalf of each such Former Company Stockholder. To the extent not used for
such purposes, such shares shall be released, all as provided in Article VIII
hereof.

                  (d) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate surrenders
such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any such
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
which would have been previously payable (but for the provisions of this Section
1.11(d)) with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

                  (e) TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If any certificate for shares of
Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered is
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

                  (f) NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 1.11, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any
party hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

                  (g) DISSENTING SHARES. The provisions of this Section 1.11
shall also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except
that the obligations of Parent under this Section 1.11 shall commence on the
date of loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange for such shares the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof.

                                       7


<PAGE>

         1.12 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. All shares
of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

         1.13 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent
Common Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6; provided, however, that
Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

         1.14 TAX AND ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCES. It is intended by the parties
hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code.

         1.15 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Company, the officers and directors of Company and Merger Sub
are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise
to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such
action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

         1.16 STOCK RESTRICTION AGREEMENTS. As of the date hereof, each of the
Founders shall have entered into a Stock Restriction Agreement substantially in
the form of attached hereto as EXHIBIT B.

                                   ARTICLE II

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY
                    -----------------------------------------

         The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the

forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Company to Parent prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"). The
Company Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the
numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article II, and the
disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify only the corresponding paragraph in
this Article II. Any reference in this Article II to an agreement being

is subject to (i) laws of general application relating to

                                       8


<PAGE>

bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and the relief of debtors, and (ii) the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.

         2.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization. Company has the corporate power to own its
properties and to carry on its business as currently conducted and as proposed
to be conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing
would have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.2) on Company.
Company has delivered to Parent a true and correct copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Company including any amendments thereto. Company is
not in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws. Company does not directly or indirectly own any capital stock or similar
equity interest in, or any interest convertible or, exchangeable or exercisable
for, any capital stock or similar equity interest in, any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, or other business association or entity.

         2.2 CAPITAL STRUCTURE. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital
stock of Company consists of 85,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001

Stock"). As of the date hereof, there are no other outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock disregarding any option exercises following June 14, 2000. All
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and are free of any liens or encumbrances (other
than any liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon the holders thereof),
and except as set forth on Section 2.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter are not
subject to preemptive rights, rights of first refusal, rights of first offer or
similar rights created by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of
Company or any agreement to which Company is a party or by which it is bound. As

Stock for issuance upon conversion of the Series A Preferred, (ii) 8,020,020
shares of Company Common Stock for issuance upon conversion of the Series B

are subject to outstanding, unexercised options as of June 14, 2000), (iv)

contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock Restriction Agreements, (ii)
Company's right to repurchase any unvested shares under the Company Stock Option
Plan, (iii) shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding
Company Options and

                                       9


<PAGE>

Company Warrants, as specified in clauses (iii) and (iv) of the immediately
preceding sentence, and (iv) 50,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issuable
pursuant to outstanding warrants to purchase Series A Preferred Stock, there are
no other options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any
character (whether or not contingent or earned) to which Company is a party or
by which it is bound obligating Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or
redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any
shares of Company Capital Stock or obligating Company to grant, extend,
accelerate the vesting or lapse of a repurchase right of, change the price of,
or otherwise amend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right,
commitment or agreement. As of the date hereof, except as contemplated by this
Agreement, there are no currently effective contracts, commitments or agreements
relating to the voting, purchase or sale of Company Capital Stock (i) between or
among Company and any of its stockholders and (ii) to Company's knowledge, among
any of Company's stockholders or between any of Company's stockholders and any
third party except for the stockholders delivering the Stockholders Agreement
attached hereto as EXHIBIT H. The terms of the Company Stock Option Plan permit
the assumption of the Company Stock Option Plan by Parent as provided in this
Agreement, without the consent or approval of the holders of the outstanding
options, the Company stockholders, or otherwise and without any acceleration of
the exercise schedule or vesting provisions or lapse of repurchase rights (or
eligibility for such acceleration or lapse by virtue of the Merger) in effect
for such options. True and complete copies of all agreements and instruments
evidencing all outstanding Company Options issued under the Company Stock Option
Plan have been furnished to Parent, and such agreements and instruments have not
been amended, modified or supplemented, except where any such modification has
been supplied to Parent, and there are no agreements to amend, modify or
supplement such agreements or instruments from the form made available to
Parent. All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and outstanding Company
Options, Company Warrants and Other Company Stock Rights were issued in
compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws.

                  (a) Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (collectively, the
"Transaction Documents") and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, subject to obtaining necessary approvals of the Company's
stockholders. The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Company, subject
only to the approval of the Merger by Company's stockholders as contemplated by
Section 6.1(a). The Transaction Documents have been duly executed and delivered
by Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other parties hereto and thereto, constitute the valid and binding obligations
of Company enforceable against Company in accordance with their terms.

                  (b) The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents by
Company do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default under
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or loss of
any material benefit under (i) any provision of the Certificate of

                                       10


<PAGE>

Incorporation, as amended (the "Company Certificate"), or Bylaws of Company, as
amended (the "Company Bylaws"), (ii) any Material Contract (as defined in
Section 2.24), permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, orders or
decree, or (iii) any statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to
Company or any of its properties or assets subject to obtaining the approval and
adoption of the Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders of Company and
compliance with the requirements of subsection (c) below.

                  (c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any court, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality ("Governmental
Entity") is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Company in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents or the
consummation of the transactions by Company contemplated hereby or thereby,
except for (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger, as provided in Section
1.2; (ii) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings as may be required under applicable federal or state
securities laws and the securities laws of any foreign country; (iii) such
filings as may be required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended ("HSR"); (iv) the filing of an application for
qualification by permit with the California Department of Corporations pursuant
to Section 5.2 hereof or the filing of a Registration Statement to the extent
such permit is not issued; and (v) any such other consent, approval, order or
authorization where any failure to obtain the same would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company and would not prevent, materially alter or delay by
more than five (5) business days any of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents.

         2.4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Company has delivered to Parent its audited
financial statements (balance sheet, statement of operations, statement of
stockholders' equity and statement of cash flows) for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1999 and its unaudited financial statements (balance sheet,
statement of operations, statement of stockholders' equity and statement of cash
flows) as of, and for the five (5) month period ended May 31, 2000
(collectively, the "Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in
effect in the United States on the date hereof ("GAAP") (except that the
unaudited financial statements do not have notes thereto) applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated and with each other. Company
believes that its current revenue recognition policy complies with the
guidelines contained in SAB 101 (Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements).
The Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition and operating results of Company as of the dates, and for the periods,
indicated therein, subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments. Company maintains a standard system of
accounting established and administered in accordance with GAAP.

         2.5 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Except as permitted under Section 4.1
of this Agreement for changes occurring after the date hereof, since May 31,
2000, (the "Company Balance Sheet Date"), Company has conducted its business in
the ordinary course and there has not occurred: (i) any change, event or
condition (whether or not covered by insurance) that has had, or might
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Company; (ii) any
acquisition, sale or transfer of any material asset of Company; (iii) any change
in accounting methods or practices (including any change in depreciation or
amortization policies or rates) by

                                       11


<PAGE>

Company or any revaluation by Company of any of its assets; (iv) any
declaration, setting aside, or payment of a dividend or other distribution with
respect to the shares of Company, or any direct or indirect redemption, purchase
or other acquisition by Company of any of its shares of capital stock; (v) any
Material Contract entered into by Company, or any material amendment or
termination of, or default under, any Material Contract to which Company is a
party or by which it is bound in each case other than as set forth in Schedule
2.24; (vi) any amendment or change to the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
of Company; (vii) any increase in or modification of the compensation or
benefits payable or to become payable by Company to any of its directors,
employees or consultants other than compensation adjustments and stock options
granted to Company employees pursuant to Section 4.1; or (viii) any negotiation
or agreement by Company to do any of the things described in the preceding
clauses (i) through (vii) (other than negotiations with Parent and its
representatives regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

         2.6 ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Company has no material
obligations or liabilities of any nature (matured or unmatured, fixed or
contingent) other than (i) those set forth or adequately provided for in the
Balance Sheet as of the Company Balance Sheet Date (the "Company Balance
Sheet"), (ii) those incurred in the ordinary course of business prior to the
Company Balance Sheet Date and not required to be set forth in the Company
Balance Sheet under GAAP, (iii) those incurred in the ordinary course of
business since the Company Balance Sheet Date, and (iv) those incurred in
connection with the execution of this Agreement.

         2.7 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. The accounts receivable shown on the Company
Balance Sheet arose in the ordinary course of business. Allowances for doubtful
accounts have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and to the Company's
knowledge are adequate. The accounts receivable of the Company arising after the
Company Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date hereof arose, and the accounts
receivable arising prior to the Effective Time will arise, in the ordinary
course of business. None of the accounts receivable of the Company are subject
to any material claim of offset or recoupment, or counterclaim, and Company has
no knowledge of any specific facts that would be reasonably likely give rise to
any such claim. No material amount of accounts receivable of the Company are
contingent upon the performance by Company of any obligation. No material
agreement for deduction or discount has been made with respect to any accounts
receivable of the Company.

         2.8 LITIGATION. There is no private or governmental action, suit,
proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending before any agency,
court, tribunal or other entity, foreign or domestic, or, to the knowledge of
Company, threatened (or, to the knowledge of the Company, any reasonable basis
for any such action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation,
including allegations that could form the basis for future action) against
Company or any of its properties or officers or directors (in their capacities
as such), nor does Company have any reason to expect that any such activity,
threat or allegation will be forthcoming. There is no judgment, decree or order
against Company, or, to the knowledge of Company, any of its directors or
officers (in their capacities as such), that could prevent, enjoin, or
materially alter or delay by more than five (5) business days any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. All litigation to which
Company is a party (or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened to

                                       12


<PAGE>

become a party) is disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter. Company does not

against any third party.

         2.9 RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. There is no agreement,
judgment, injunction, order or decree, including any exclusive or non-exclusive

practice of Company, any acquisition of property by Company or the conduct of
business by Company as currently conducted or as proposed to be conducted by
Company.

         2.10 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. Company has obtained each federal,
state, county, local or foreign governmental consent, license, permit, grant, or
other authorization of a Governmental Entity that is required for the operation
of Company's business or the holding of any such interest in any of its
properties ("Company Authorizations"), and all of such Company Authorizations
are in full force and effect, except where the failure to obtain or have any
such Company Authorizations could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company.

         2.11 TITLE TO PROPERTY. Company has (a) good and marketable title to
all of its properties, interests in properties and assets, real and personal,
necessary for the conduct of its business as presently conducted or which are

otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the Company
Balance Sheet Date), or (b) with respect to leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests therein, in each case free and clear of all mortgages,
liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances of any kind or character, except (as to
both (a) and (b)) (i) the lien of current taxes not yet due and payable, (ii)

judgments, permits, licenses, consents, approvals, authorizations, and
governmental requirements or directives or other obligations lawfully imposed
by governmental authority under federal, state or local law pertaining to the
protection of the environment, protection of public health, protection of
worker health and safety, the treatment, emission and/or discharge of
gaseous, particulate and/or effluent pollutants, and/or the handling of

         2.14 TAXES.

              (a) All Tax returns, statements, reports, declarations and other
forms and documents (including without limitation estimated Tax returns and
reports and material information statements, returns and reports) required to be
filed with any Tax authority with respect to any Taxable period ending on or
before the Effective Time, by or on behalf of Company (collectively, "Tax
Returns" and individually a "Tax Return"), have been or will be completed and
filed when due (including any extensions of such due date) and all amounts shown
due on such Tax Returns and, to the knowledge of the Company, any other Taxes
due on or before the Effective Time have been or will be paid on or before such
date. The Company Balance Sheet (i) fully accrues in accordance with GAAP all
actual and contingent liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods through
the Company Balance Sheet Date, and Company has not and will not incur any Tax
liability (determined in accordance with GAAP) in excess of the amount reflected
on such Company Balance Sheet with respect to such periods (excluding any amount
thereof that reflects timing differences between the recognition of income for
purposes of GAAP and for Tax purposes), and (ii) properly accrues in accordance
with GAAP all material liabilities for Taxes with respect to periods after the
Company Balance Sheet Date. No material Tax liability since the Company Balance
Sheet Date has been or will be incurred by Company

                                       15


<PAGE>

other than in the ordinary course of business, and adequate provision has been
made by Company for all Taxes since that date in accordance with GAAP on at
least a quarterly basis.

              (b) Company has previously provided or made available to Parent
true and correct copies of all Tax Returns. Company has withheld and paid to the
applicable financial institution or Tax authority all amounts required to be
withheld. To the best knowledge of Company, none of its Tax Returns have been
examined and closed. Company (or any member of any affiliated or combined group
of which Company has been a member) has not granted any extension or waiver of
the limitation period applicable to any Tax Returns that is still in effect.
There is no material claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation
now pending to the knowledge of Company with respect to Company in respect of
any Tax or assessment of the Company. No notice of deficiency or similar
document of any Tax authority has been received by Company, and to the knowledge
of the Company there are no material liabilities for Taxes (including
liabilities for interest, additions to Tax and penalties thereon and related
expenses) with respect to the issues that have been raised (and are currently
pending) by any Tax authority that could, if determined adversely to Company,
materially and adversely affect the liability of Company for Taxes. There are no
liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet due and payable) upon the
assets of Company. Company has never been a member of an affiliated group of
corporations, within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code. Company is in
compliance in all material respects with all the terms and conditions of any Tax
exemptions or other Tax-sharing agreement or order of a foreign government and
the consummation of the Merger will not have any adverse effect on the continued
validity and effectiveness of any such Tax exemption or other Tax-sharing
agreement or order. Neither Company nor any person on behalf of Company has
entered into or will enter into any agreement or consent pursuant to the
collapsible corporation provisions of Section 341(f) of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income tax law) or agreed to
have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state,
local or foreign income tax law) apply to any disposition of any asset owned by
Company. None of the assets of Company directly or indirectly secures any debt
the interest on which is tax-exempt under Section 103(a) of the Code. Company
has never been a party (either as a distributing corporation or as a corporation
that has been distributed) to any transaction intended to qualify under Section
355 of the Code or any corresponding provision of state law. To the Company's
knowledge, no Company stockholder is other than a United States person within
the meaning of the Code. Company does not have and has not had a permanent
establishment in any foreign country, as defined in any applicable tax treaty or
convention between the United States of America and such foreign country.
Company has never elected to be treated as an S-corporation under Section 1362
of the Code or any corresponding provision of federal or state law. There is no
agreement, contract or arrangement to which Company is a party that could,
individually or collectively, result in the payment of any amount that would not
be deductible by reason of Sections 162(a) (by reason of being unreasonable in
amount), 162 (b) through (p) or 404 of the Code, except where the failure of
such payment to be deductible would not have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company. Except as may arise pursuant to leases or licensing
arrangements, Company is not a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax
sharing or Tax allocation agreement (whether written or unwritten or arising
under operation of federal law as a result of being a member of a group filing
consolidated Tax returns, under operation of certain state laws as a result of
being a member of a unitary group, or under comparable laws of other states or
foreign jurisdictions) which includes a party other than Company, nor does
Company

                                       16


<PAGE>

owe any amount under any such Agreement. Other than by reason of the Merger,
Company has not been and will not be required to include any adjustment in
Taxable income for any Tax period (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 481
or 263A of the Code or any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws
as a result of transactions, events or accounting methods employed prior to the
Merger, except where such adjustment would not have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company.

              (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the
following meanings: "Tax" (and, with correlative meaning, "Taxes" and "Taxable")
means any and all taxes including, without limitation, (i) any net income,
alternative or add-on minimum tax, gross income, gross receipts, sales, use, ad
valorem, transfer, franchise, profits, value added, net worth, withholding,
payroll, employment, excise, severance, stamp, occupation, premium, property,
windfall profit tax, custom, duty or other like assessment, together with any
interest or any penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed by any
Governmental Entity (a "Tax authority") responsible for the imposition of any
such tax (domestic or foreign), (ii) any liability for the payment of any
amounts of the type described in (i) as a result of being a member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group for any Taxable period or as
the result of being a transferee or successor thereof and (iii) any liability
for the payment of any amounts of the type described in (i) or (ii) as a result
of any express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person. As used in
this Section 2.14, the term "Company" means Company and any entity included in,
or required under GAAP to be included in, any of the Company Financial
Statements.

reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this

vigorously to contest

                                       35

and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed,
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether

shall be required to agree, as a condition to any Approval, to divest itself of
or hold separate any subsidiary, division or business unit which is material to

as a result of the Merger.

other party, by written update to its Disclosure Letter, of (i) the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event which would be likely to cause any condition to
the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, or (ii) the failure of
Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would be likely to result in
any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied. The delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant requiring disclosure of such matter prior
to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Agreement.

hereof of all holders of outstanding options under the Company Stock Option Plan
including the number of shares of Company Capital Stock subject to each such
option, the exercise or vesting schedule, the exercise price per share and the
term of each such option. On the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent
an updated Option Schedule current as of such date. Each such option so assumed
by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Option Plan and the
Stock Option Grant Agreement applicable to each grant immediately without regard
to vesting restrictions prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such option
shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed option
shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock at which such option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent.

              (a) It is the intention of the parties that the options so assumed
by Parent qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as
defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such options qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time. Within 30 business days
after the Effective Time, Parent will issue to each person who, immediately
prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding option under the
Company Stock Option Plan a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such
option by Parent.

              (b) Within 30 business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms) which will register the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to assumed
options to the extent permitted by Federal securities laws and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the

                                       37


<PAGE>

effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as such options remain outstanding.

agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the appropriate vote of
stockholders of Company described in Section 5.3, including cooperating fully
with the other party, including by provision of information.

         5.16 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. Parent shall take such reasonable actions as
are necessary to allow eligible employees of Company to participate in the
benefit programs of Parent, or alternative benefit programs in the aggregate
substantially comparable to those applicable to employees of Parent on similar
terms, from and after the Effective Time of the Merger without any pre-existing
condition, actively-at-work or similar limitation or condition except to the
extent the affected eligible employee had been subject to and as of the
Effective Time had not yet satisfied a comparable limitation or condition under
the comparable Company plan. For purposes of satisfying any deductibles under
such programs, Parent shall give all credit for deductible amounts and similar
amounts paid during the current plan year by each participant under the
comparable Company plan. For purposes of satisfying the terms and conditions of
such programs, to the extent permitted by Parent's benefit programs, Parent
shall use reasonable efforts to give full credit for eligibility or vesting for
each participant's period of service with Company.

         5.17 PARACHUTE PAYMENTS. Company shall use commercially reasonable

Company's outstanding voting securities as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the proposed Treasury Regulations thereunder,
including, without limitation, Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such proposed
regulations. In the event that Company does not obtain the requisite stockholder
approvals for such provisions of any of the agreements or arrangements specified
in SCHEDULE 5.17 prior to the Effective Time, Parent may immediately thereafter
make a claim against the Escrow Fund for any Damages, whether contingent or
otherwise, arising out of such provisions not being so approved (the "Parachute
Damages"), including, without limitation, Damages consisting of the loss of
future tax deductions arising from such parachute payments. Parent's computation
as to

                                       38

any such provision. Parachute Damages shall not be subject to either the Basket

in Section 8.4 hereof).

                           --------------------------

Notwithstanding any investigation conducted before or after the Closing Date,
and notwithstanding any actual or implied knowledge or notice of any facts or
circumstances which any party hereto may have as a result of such investigation
or otherwise, such party will be entitled to rely upon the other Parties,
representations, warranties and covenants as provided in this Agreement. The
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants of Parent will survive the
Closing and continue in full force and effect until the date twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date at which time the representations, warranties,
agreements and covenants of Parent set forth in this Agreement will terminate;
provided, however that the covenant contained in Section 5.24 shall remain in
full force and effect for purposes of this Article VIII for the applicable tax
statute of limitations (and any extensions or waivers thereof) for each Former
Company Stockholder. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the
obligations of Company with respect to its representations, warranties,
pre-Closing agreements and covenants will survive the Closing and continue in
full force and effect until the date twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date, at which time the representations, warranties and pre-Closing agreements

representation, warranty, agreement or covenant on the part of Company under
this Agreement (collectively the "Parent Damages"). Parent Damages shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds, if and when actually received
by Parent or Company; provided, however (i) Parent shall have the sole
discretion as to whether to seek reimbursement under any applicable insurance
policy and (ii) Parent's failure to seek reimbursement from applicable insurance
policies shall not reduce the amount of such Damages.

<PAGE>

              (b) Former Company Stockholders shall be indemnified and held

parties, but includes Damages incurred or sustained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or Former Company Stockholders in the absence of claims by a third
party.

         8.3  ESCROW FUND. As security for the indemnity provided for in Section
8.2(a) hereof, the Escrow Shares shall be deposited by Parent in an escrow
account with a mutually acceptable financial institution as Escrow Agent (the
"Escrow Agent"), as of the Closing Date, such deposit to constitute an escrow
fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth in this Agreement
and the provisions of an Escrow Agreement to be executed and delivered pursuant
to Section 5.13. The Escrow Fund shall be allocated in whole numbers of Escrow
Shares among the Former Company Stockholders other than such stockholders who
acquired all of his or her shares of Company Capital Stock via exercise of
employee stock options issued by Company on a pro-rata basis in accordance with
the number of shares of Company Capital Stock held by the Former Company
Stockholders immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding for purposes of
this calculation any Dissenting Shares). Upon compliance with the terms hereof
and subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to obtain indemnity from the Escrow Fund for
Parent Damages covered by the indemnity provided for in Section 8.2 of this
Agreement.

         8.4  DAMAGE THRESHOLD. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may not
receive any shares from the Escrow Fund unless and until an Officer's
Certificate (as defined in Section 8.6 below) identifying Parent Damages the
aggregate amount of which exceeds $500,000 (the "Basket Amount") has been
delivered to the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 8.5 below and such amount
is determined pursuant to this Article VIII to be payable, in which case Parent
shall receive shares equal in value to the full amount of Parent Damages in
excess of $100,000 (the "Deductible Amount"); provided, however, that Parachute
Damages shall be paid out of the Escrow Fund without regard to the Basket Amount
and the Deductible Amount and provided further that the amount of Parachute
Damages shall count as Parent Damages in calculating the Basket Amount and the
Deductible Amount. In determining the amount of any Parent Damages attributable
to a breach, any materiality standard or knowledge qualifier contained in a
representation, warranty or covenant of Company shall be disregarded.

         8.5  ESCROW PERIOD. Except as contemplated by Section 8.6 hereof, the
escrow period shall end, and all Escrow Shares in the Escrow Fund shall be
released, on the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Termination

the Termination Date except for claims based on fraud.

         8.6  CLAIMS UPON ESCROW FUND.

              (a) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent on or before the end of the
Termination Date of a certificate signed by an officer of Parent (an "Officer's
Certificate") and in accordance with the Escrow Agreement:

                  (A) stating that Parent or the Surviving Corporation has
incurred, paid or properly accrued (in accordance with GAAP) or knows of facts
giving rise to a reasonable probability that it will have to incur, pay or
accrue (in accordance with GAAP) Parent Damages in an aggregate stated amount
with respect to which Parent or the Surviving Corporation is entitled to payment
from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Agreement; and

                  (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of
Parent Damages included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was
incurred, paid or properly accrued (in accordance with GAAP), or the basis for
such anticipated liability, the specific nature of the breach to which such item
is related, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section 8.7 of
this Agreement, deliver to Parent shares of Parent Common Stock in an amount
necessary to indemnify Parent for the Damages claimed. All shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such claims shall remain in the Escrow Fund until Parent
Damages are actually incurred or paid or the Parent determines in its reasonably
good faith judgment that no Parent Damages will be required to be incurred or
paid (in which event such shares shall be distributed to the Former Company
Stockholders in accordance with Section 8.10 below).

              (b) For the purpose of compensating Parent for Parent Damages
pursuant to this Agreement, the Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund shall be
valued at the average of the closing prices as reported in the edition of The
Wall Street Journal distributed in New York, NY of Parent Common Stock for the
thirty (30) trading days prior to the date of the final determination of the
amount of Parent Damages to which Parent or Surviving Corporation is entitled
pursuant to this Article VIII (the "Determination Price").

              (c) The Stockholders' Agent shall have the option to compensate
Parent for any Parent Damages, or any portion of such Parent Damages, with cash
rather than Escrow Shares. Upon satisfaction of any claim with cash, a number of
Escrow Shares shall be released by the Escrow Agent to the Stockholders' Agent
equal to the total dollar amount of such cash compensated claim divided by the
Determination Price.

         8.7  OBJECTIONS TO CLAIMS. At the time of delivery of any Officer's
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Officer's Certificate
shall be delivered to the Stockholders' Agent (defined in Section 8.9 below) and
for a period of thirty (30) days after such delivery to the Escrow Agent, the
Escrow Agent shall make no delivery of Parent Common Stock, cash, or other
property pursuant to Section 8.6 hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Stockholders' Agent to make such
delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent
shall make delivery of the Parent Common Stock or other property in the Escrow
Fund in accordance with Section 8.6 hereof, provided that no such payment or
delivery may be made if the Stockholders' Agent shall object in a written
statement to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate, and such statement
shall

                                       49

have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Parent prior to the expiration of
such thirty (30) day period.

         8.8  RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS; ARBITRATION.

              (a) In case the Stockholders' Agent shall so object in writing to
any claim or claims by Parent made in any Officer's Certificate, the
Stockholders' Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Stockholders' Agent and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to
the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and shall distribute the Parent Common Stock or other property from
the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

              (b) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, either Parent or the Stockholders' Agent may, by written notice to
the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Damage is
at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration
shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by the Arbitrator (as defined below) under the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Within fifteen (15) days after
such written notice is sent, Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall each
select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third
arbitrator (the "Arbitrator").

              (c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in
Mountain View, California under the commercial rules then in effect of the
American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this Section 8.8, in any
arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the
Officer's Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the
Non-Prevailing Party unless the arbitrators award Parent more than one-half
(1/2) of the amount in dispute, plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the
Former Company Stockholders for whom shares of Company Common Stock otherwise
issuable to them have been deposited in the Escrow Fund shall be deemed to be
the Non-Prevailing Party. The Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay
its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the
American Arbitration Association, and the expenses, including without
limitation, attorneys' fees and costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to
the arbitration.

         8.9  STOCKHOLDERS' AGENT.

              (a) By virtue of Company stockholders' approval of the Merger,
Peter Lamm shall be constituted and appointed as agent ("Stockholders' Agent")
and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Former Company Stockholders to
give and receive notices and communications, to execute the Escrow Agreement to
authorize delivery to Parent of the Parent Common Stock or other property from
the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent or satisfy claims by Parent
with cash, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of
courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all
actions necessary or appropriate

                                       50


<PAGE>

in the judgment of the Stockholders' Agent for the accomplishment of the
foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority in interest
of the Escrow Fund from time to time upon not less than 10 days' prior written
notice to Parent. The Stockholders' Agent may resign upon thirty (30) days
notice to the parties to this Agreement and the Former Company Stockholders. No
bond shall be required of the Stockholders' Agent, and the Stockholders' Agent
shall receive no compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or
from the Stockholders' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Former Company Stockholders.

              (b) The Stockholders' Agent shall not be liable for any act done
or omitted hereunder as Stockholders' Agent while acting in good faith and in
the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Former
Company Stockholders shall severally indemnify the Stockholders' Agent and hold
him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders' Agent and arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties
hereunder.

              (c) The Stockholders' Agent shall have reasonable access to
information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of
Company's former officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties
and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the Stockholders' Agent shall
treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about
Surviving Corporation to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals
who agree to treat such information confidentially).

              (d) The Stockholders' Agent shall be entitled to a distribution
from the Escrow Fund equal to any such indemnity claim which has not been
satisfied; provided, however, that no such distribution shall be made until all
claims of Parent set forth in any Officer's Certificate delivered to the Escrow
Agent on or prior to the Termination Date have been resolved.

         8.10 DISTRIBUTION UPON TERMINATION OF ESCROW PERIOD. Within five (5)
business days following the Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to
the Former Company Stockholders all of the Escrow Shares in the Escrow Fund in
excess of any amount of such Escrow Shares reasonably necessary to satisfy any
unsatisfied or disputed claims for Parent Damages specified in any Officer's
Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent on or before the Termination Date and
any unsatisfied or disputed claims by the Stockholders' Agent under Section 8.9.
As soon as all such claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to
the Former Company Stockholders all Escrow Shares remaining in the Escrow Fund
and not required to satisfy such claims. Deliveries of Escrow Shares to the
Former Company Stockholders pursuant to this section shall be made in proportion
to the allocation set forth in Section 8.3.

         8.11 ACTIONS OF THE STOCKHOLDERS' AGENT. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders' Agent shall constitute a decision of all Former
Company Stockholders for whom shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable
to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Former Company Stockholder, and the Escrow Agent and
Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or

                                       51


<PAGE>

instruction of the Stockholders' Agent as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of each and every such Former Company Stockholder. The Escrow Agent
and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts
done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholders' Agent.

         8.12 THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. In the event Parent becomes aware of a
third-party claim which Parent believes may result in a demand against the
Escrow Fund, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders' Agent of such claim.
Parent shall have the right to settle any such claim with the written consent of
the Stockholders' Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, however, that the Stockholders' Agent may, at his or her option,
direct the settlement negotiations other than for claims related to (i) the
Company Intellectual Property or (ii) disputes or disagreements with customers
of Parent or Company. In the event that the Stockholders' Agent consents to any
such settlement, neither the Former Company Stockholders nor the Stockholders'
Agent shall have any power or authority to object under Section 8.7 or any other
provision of this Agreement to the amount of any claim by Parent against the
Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement (provided that the
Former Company Stockholders and the Stockholders' Agent shall not be precluded
from objecting that the claim is not the type of claim (but without objections
to the amount of the claim) for which Parent is entitled to indemnification from
the Escrow Fund). If any proceeding is commenced, or if any claim, demand or
assessment is asserted, in respect of which a claim for indemnification is or
might be made against the Escrow Fund based on matters other than (i) the
Company Intellectual Property or (ii) claims made by customers of Parent or
Company, the Stockholders' Agent may, at his or her option, contest or defend
any such action, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment, with counsel selected
by the Stockholders' Agent who is reasonably acceptable to Parent; provided,
however, that if Parent shall reasonably object to such control, then the
Stockholders' Agent and Parent shall cooperate in the defense of such matter;
provided further, that the Stockholders' Agent shall not admit any liability
with respect thereto or settle, compromise, pay or discharge the same without
the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. With respect to any claim for indemnification based on matters
relating to the Company Intellectual Property, or customers of Company or
Parent, Parent shall have the option to defend any such proceeding with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Stockholders' Agent; provided, however, that
Parent shall not admit any liability with respect thereto or settle, compromise,
pay or discharge the same without the prior written consent of the Stockholders'
Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that the
Stockholders' Agent consents to any such settlement, neither the Former Company
Stockholders nor the Stockholders' Agent shall have any power or authority to
object under Section 8.7 or any other provision of this Agreement to the amount
of any claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to
such settlement (provided that the Former Company Stockholders and the
Stockholders' Agent shall not be precluded from objecting that the claim is not
the type of claim (but without objections to the amount of the claim) for which
Parent is entitled to indemnification from the Escrow Fund). The Stockholders'
Agent or Parent, whichever is not controlling the defense of any matter, shall
be entitled to participate in such defense, at Parent's or the Former Company
Stockholders' expense. Any costs of defense of third party claims up to $250,000
and fifty percent (50%) of the costs thereafter (including attorneys' fees),
incurred on behalf of the Stockholders' Agent or Former Company Stockholders
(calculated on a cumulative basis for all third party claims to which this
Section 8.12 applies) shall be submitted to the Escrow Agent and reimbursed with
shares from the Escrow Fund. For

                                       52


<PAGE>

the purpose of reimbursing such costs, the Parent Common Stock in the Escrow
Fund shall be valued at the average of the closing prices of Parent Common Stock
for the thirty (30) trading days prior to the date that an invoice for such
costs is sent to the Escrow Agent.

         8.13 MAXIMUM LIABILITY AND REMEDIES. The rights of the Parent to make
claims upon the Escrow Fund in accordance with this Article VIII shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time with respect to any breach by Company of any representation,
warranty or pre-Closing covenant or agreement made by Company under this
Agreement and no current or former stockholder, optionholder, warrantholder,
director, officer, employee or agent of Company shall have any personal
liability to Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time as a
result of such breach; provided, however, that nothing herein limits any
potential remedies of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, arising under
applicable state and federal laws with respect to any fraudulent breaches of the
representations, warranties or covenants of Company made in or pursuant to this
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of any Principal
Stockholder in connection with any breach by such stockholder of the Stockholder
Agreement.

Company, Marco Iansiti, Robert Lanigan and Daniel Heaney) and (iii) if such
party is another entity, the actual knowledge of the individuals that have
similar positions, powers or responsibilities as officers and/or directors of a
corporation. The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the
information referred to has been made available if requested by the party to
whom such information is to be made available. The phrases "the date of this
Agreement", "the date hereof", and terms of similar import, unless the context
otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer June __, 2000. The term "Affiliate"

more intermediaries controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
such specified person. The term "control" (including the terms "controlled by"

Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter (a) constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties

terms and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies hereunder, except for the rights of the holders of Company Capital
Stock, Company Options, Company Warrants and Other Company Stock Rights to
receive (a) the consideration set forth in Article I of this Agreement and
(b) indemnification as set forth in Article VIII of this Agreement.

         9.5  SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

                                       55

warranties, agreements and covenants of the Company (subject to an in accordance
with Article VIII), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement

and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

         9.9  RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of

                             AMENDMENT NO. 1 OF THE
                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION


         THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 OF THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION
("Amendment") is entered into as of June 29th, 2000, by and among Ariba, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Eli Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Merger Sub"), and SupplierMarket.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Company"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Amendment have the
meaning given them in the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated June 21,
2000, by and among Parent, Merger Sub and Company (the "Agreement").

                                    RECITALS

         A. Pursuant to Section 7.4 of the Agreement, the Agreement may be
amended at any time prior adoption of the Agreement by the stockholders of
Company by execution of an instrument in writing signed by Parent and Company.

         B. Parent, Merger Sub and Company desire to amend certain provisions of
the Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
hereinafter set forth, Parent, Merger Sub and Company hereby agree as follows:

         1. Pursuant to Section 7.4 of the Agreement, the first paragraph of
Section 5.12 of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to
read as follows:

     STOCK OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, the Company Stock Option Plan and
     each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under
     the Company Stock Option Plan, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed
     by Parent. In addition, Company's rights to repurchase shares of Company
     Common Stock under the Company Stock Option Plan or otherwise shall be
     assigned to, and assumed by, Parent. Company has delivered to Parent a
     schedule (the "Option Schedule") which sets forth a true and complete list
     as of the date hereof of all holders of outstanding options under the
     Company Stock Option Plan including the number of shares of Company Capital
     Stock subject to each such option, the exercise or vesting schedule, the
     exercise price per share and the term of each such option. On the Closing
     Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an updated Option Schedule current as
     of such date. Each such option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement
     shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
     set forth in the Company Stock Option Plan and the Stock Option Grant
     Agreement applicable to each grant immediately prior to the Effective Time,
     except that (i) such option shall be exercisable for that number of whole
     shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares
     of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such option
     without regard to vesting restrictions immediately prior to the Effective
     Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole





<PAGE>

     number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise
     price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
     assumed option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
     exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such option was
     exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
     rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

         2. Pursuant to Section 7.4 of the Agreement, Section 1.6(a) of the
Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

     (a) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK/EXCHANGE RATIO. Each share of
         Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
         Time shall be exchanged into the number of shares of Parent Common
         Stock determined by dividing (i) the Total Parent Shares less the
         Additional Parent Shares by (ii) the Outstanding Company Shares,
         rounded to eight decimal points (the "Exchange Ratio").

         3. Pursuant to Section 7.4 of the Agreement, Section 1.11(c) of the
Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

     (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
         cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or
         certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the
         Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock,
         whose shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent
         Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal
         (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
         and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the
         Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have
         such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
         (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
         Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent
         Common Stock. In addition Parent shall cause to be mailed to Broadview
         International LLC ("Broadview") a Certificate for the Company Financial
         Advisory Fee Shares in accordance with instructions provided to Parent
         by Broadview which are reasonably acceptable to Parent. Upon surrender
         of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
         other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
         letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
         accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
         Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
         certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common
         Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
         1.6, less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited
         in the Escrow Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to Article VIII
         hereof, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
         Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the
         Effective Time,




                                       2
<PAGE>

         represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and
         after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the
         payment of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of full
         shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Capital
         Stock shall have been so converted. As soon as practicable after the
         Effective Time, and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of
         Section 8.3 hereof, Parent shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow
         Agent (as defined in Section 8.3 hereof) a certificate or certificates
         representing ten percent (10%) of the amount equal to (i) Total Parent
         Shares less (ii) the Additional Parent Shares ("Escrow Shares") which
         shall be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent as nominee for the
         holders of Certificates cancelled pursuant to this Section 1.11. The
         Escrow Shares shall be comprised entirely of Shares of Parent Common
         Stock that are not subject to any vesting restriction or repurchase
         right. The entire portion of Escrow Shares shall be contributed in
         respect of Total Parent Shares less the Additional Parent Shares
         issuable to Former Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.6(a)
         other than (A) such stockholders who acquired all of his or her shares
         of Company Capital Stock via exercise of employee stock options issued
         by Company and (B) the stockholder other than the Founders, who is an
         employee of the Company and acquired all of his shares of Company
         Capital stock via a restricted stock grant by the Company. Such shares
         shall be beneficially owned by such holders and shall be held in escrow
         and shall be available to compensate Parent for certain damages as
         provided in Article VIII. The Escrow Shares will appear as issued and
         outstanding on Parent's balance sheet and will be legally outstanding
         under applicable state law. All dividends paid on Escrow Shares
         (excluding any shares of Parent Capital Stock paid in connection with a
         stock split or stock dividend) will be distributed currently to each of
         the exchanging Former Company Stockholders, and all voting rights of
         the Escrow Shares will be exercisable by or on behalf of each such
         Former Company Stockholder. To the extent not used for such purposes,
         such shares shall be released, all as provided in Article VIII hereof.


         4. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

         5. This Amendment when executed by Parent, Merger Sub and Company as of
the date hereof shall have been effected in accordance with Section 7.4 of the
Agreement and accordingly shall be binding upon each such party.

         6. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of California without regard to applicable principles of
conflicts of law.
