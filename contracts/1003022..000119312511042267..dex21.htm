in accordance with this Agreement. Such ADSs, together with (i) any cash in
lieu of fractional ADSs to which holders of Company Certificates may be
entitled under Section 2.3(f) and (ii) any dividends or other distributions
paid with respect to those shares and to which the holders of Company
Certificates may be entitled under Section 2.3(d), are collectively referred
to as the "Exchange Fund."

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any
event within 10 Business Days thereof, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time) of a Company Certificate or Book Entry Shares, (1) a letter of
transmittal in customary form, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares
to the Exchange Agent or receipt in respect of Book Entry Shares of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), (2) instructions
for surrendering Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented
thereby, and (3) any form, declaration or certificate required under the
Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling.

(ii) _Surrender of Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares_. Upon (A)
surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal or (B) transfer of Book-
Entry Shares, the holder of that Company Certificate or Book Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (1) the number of whole ADSs to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (2) the cash payable
in lieu of fractional ADSs such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.3(f), and (3) any dividends or distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(d), in each case less any required
withholding of Taxes, and in each case which Parent shall issue and/or shall
cause the Depositary Bank and the Exchange Agent to issue (or, if applicable,
transfer the legal title to, for no

 



-11-   consideration) and/or pay in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement,
and Parents register of members shall be updated accordingly. The ADSs shall
be accepted into The Depository Trust Company and issued in uncertificated
book-entry form to such account as shall be specified in the completed letter
of transmittal, unless a physical American depositary receipt is requested or
is otherwise required by applicable Laws, in which case Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send such receipt representing ADSs to such holder
promptly in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement. Any Company
Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled immediately. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on any amount payable upon surrender of Company
Certificates.

(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, then the Merger Consideration may be issued and/or paid in accordance
with this Section 2.3(c) to a person other than the person in whose name the
Company Certificate so surrendered is registered if (A) such Company
Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and
(B) the person requesting such payment (1) pays any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the transfer or (2) establishes to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid
or are not applicable.

 

(iv) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
2.3(c), each Company Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be deemed, from
and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares represented by
such Company Certificate or Book Entry Share. The Merger Consideration issued
or paid upon the surrender of any Company Certificate or Book Entry Share will
be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to that (A) Company Certificate and the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by it or (B) Book Entry Share.

(v) _102 Common Stock_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any ADSs issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1 (and any cash paid with respect to fractional ADSs
pursuant to Section 2.3(f)) in respect of Company Common Stock acquired upon
the exercise of Company Stock Options granted under Section 102 of the
Israeli Income Tax Ordinance [New Version], 1961, as amended, and all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder ("ITO"), shall be delivered by the
Exchange Agent to the Trustee promptly after the Effective Time in accordance
with the Israeli Option Tax Ruling, if obtained, and held in trust by the
Trustee pursuant to the applicable provisions of Section 102 and the Israeli
Options Tax Ruling, if obtained. Such cash and ADSs shall be released by the
Trustee in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 102 of the ITO,
the Option Tax Ruling, if obtained, the trust documents governing the trust
held by the Trustee, and the other terms and conditions otherwise set forth
herein with respect to stockholders of the Company.

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to ADSs that have a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to a holder of (i) an unsurrendered Company
Certificate until that Company Certificate is properly surrendered or (ii) a
Book Entry Share that is not transferred, in each case in accordance with
this Article II. Subject to applicable Laws, following the proper surrender of
any such Company Certificate or Book Entry Share, there shall be issued or
paid to such holder of ADSs

 



-12-   issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (x) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable (if any) with respect
to such ADSs or the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares that have a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of
issuance of such ADSs and (y) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends
or other distributions payable with respect to such ADSs that have a record
date after the Effective Time and a payment date after the date of issuance of
such ADSs.

(e) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(f) _Fractional Shares_.

(i) No certificates, receipts or scrip representing fractional ADSs shall be
issued upon the surrender of Company Certificates or transfer of Book Entry
Shares, and such fractional ADS interests will not entitle their owners to
vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Parent. Each holder of Company Certificates or Book Entry
Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of an ADS
under this Article II (after taking into account all Company Certificates
delivered by such holder) shall receive from the Exchange Agent, in accordance
with the provisions of this Article II, a cash payment in United States
dollars in lieu of such fractional share interest either (A) representing
that holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the
Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of the aggregate of the fractional
ADSs which would otherwise have been issued under this Article II (the
"Excess ADSs") or (B) in accordance with Section 2.3(f)(ii). The sale of the
Excess ADSs shall be (A) executed on The NASDAQ Stock Market and (B) made at
such times, in such manner and on such terms as the Exchange Agent shall
determine in its reasonable discretion. Until the net proceeds of such sale or
sales have been distributed to the holders of Company Certificates in
accordance with this Section 2.3, the Exchange Agent shall hold the net
proceeds in trust (the "Exchange Trust") for those holders. All commissions,
fees, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the
expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with
the sale of the Excess ADSs shall be paid by Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash to be paid to holders of Company Certificates and Book Entry Shares in
lieu of fractional ADSs, the Exchange Agent shall make that amount available
to those holders, without interest. The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of the net proceeds to which each holder of Company Certificates or
Book Entry Shares shall be entitled by multiplying the aggregate amount of
the net proceeds by a fraction of which (1) the numerator is the amount of the
fractional share interest to which such holder of Company Certificates or Book
Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account all Company Certificates
delivered by such holder) and (2) the denominator is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of Company Certificates and
Book Entry Shares are entitled.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3(f)(i), Parent may elect, at
its option exercised prior to the Effective Time, to pay to the Exchange
Agent an amount in cash in United States dollars, to be deposited on the first
Business Day following the Effective Time,

 



-13-   sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay each holder of Company Certificates
or Book Entry Shares an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the fraction of an ADS to which such holder would otherwise
have been entitled by (B) the closing price for an ADS on The NASDAQ Stock
Market on the first Business Day immediately following the Effective Time. In
such event, all references in this Agreement to the net proceeds from the
sale of the Excess ADSs and similar references shall be deemed to refer to the
payments calculated in the manner set forth in this Section 2.3(f)(ii).

(g) _Required Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payments
or consideration made pursuant to this Agreement such amounts or such number
of ADSs as they may be required to deduct and withhold from such payment or
consideration under any applicable Tax Laws, including the ITO; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Parent, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation
are provided at least three (3) Business Days prior to any payment payable
pursuant to this Agreement with what Parent, the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Corporation determines in their reasonable discretion to be a valid
approval or ruling issued by the ITA (including the Tax Rulings) regarding the
deduction or withholding of tax (including the reduction of tax to be
withheld, an exemption from withholding or any other instructions regarding
the payment of withholding) (the "Israeli Tax Certificate") from any
consideration payable to such payee hereunder, then the withholding (if any)
of any amounts under the ITO, from the consideration payable to such payee
hereunder, and the payment of the consideration or any portion thereof, shall
be made only in accordance with the provisions of such Israeli Tax
Certificate. If Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, deducts or withholds any such amounts, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

(h) _Termination of Exchange Fund and Exchange Trust_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund or the Exchange Trust that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Company Certificates one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Parent upon demand. Any holder of Company Certificates
who has not complied with this Article II shall look thereafter only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration.

(i) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Certificates for any Merger
Consideration properly delivered to a public official under any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

(j) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Company Certificate is
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent shall issue the Merger Consideration in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate.

 

Section 2.4 Treatment of Stock Options, RSUs and ESPP.

 



-14-  (a) As of the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Company Stock
Options") and issued under any "Company Option Plans" (as defined below),
shall be assumed and converted (as converted, a "Converted Stock Option"), by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of that
Company Stock Option, into an option exercisable for that number of ADSs equal
to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
for which such Company Stock Option was exercisable multiplied by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price
per share of such Converted Stock Option shall be equal to (x) the per share
exercise price of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent.

(b) As of the conversion pursuant to Section 2.4(a), each Converted Stock
Option shall have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the applicable Company Option Plan and the option agreement pursuant to
which the corresponding Company Stock Option was granted, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein
or in the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and the option
agreement pursuant to which the corresponding Company Stock Option was
granted.

(c) To the extent that any Company Stock Option constituted an "incentive
stock option" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) immediately
prior to the Effective Time, such Company Stock Option shall continue to
qualify as an "incentive stock option" to the maximum extent permitted by
Section 422 of the Code.

(d) Parent shall convert Company Stock Options into Converted Stock Options
in such a manner as to ensure that the Converted Stock Options are not subject
to Section 409A of the Code as a result of such assumption and conversion.

(e) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Option Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Company RSU")
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into a restricted stock unit, on the same terms
and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements and deferral
provisions) as applied to each such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with respect to the number of ADSs that is equal to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the
nearest whole share) (a "Converted Parent RSU"). As of the Effective Time,
each Converted Parent RSU shall have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Company Option Plan and the Company
RSU agreement pursuant to which the corresponding Company RSU was granted, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise
provided herein or in the applicable Company Option Plan and the Company RSU
agreement pursuant to which the corresponding Company RSU was granted.

(f) Parent will (i) reserve for issuance the number of ADSs and underlying
Parent Ordinary Shares that will become subject to the Converted Stock Options
and Converted Parent RSUs referred to in this Section 2.4 and (ii) issue or
cause to be issued the appropriate number of

 



-15-   ADSs and underlying Parent Ordinary Shares, upon the exercise of the
Converted Stock Options and Converted Parent RSUs. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent will prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering a
number of Converted Parent RSUs and underlying Parent Ordinary Shares
necessary to fulfill Parents obligations under this Section 2.4.
Such registration statement will be kept effective (and the current status of
the prospectus required thereby will be maintained) for at least as long as
Converted Stock Options and Converted Parent RSUs remain outstanding.

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in
taking all actions that are necessary to cause the Company Stock Options and
Company RSUs to be assumed and converted as provided in this Section 2.4. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will deliver to the
holders of the Converted Stock Options and Converted Parent RSUs
appropriate notices setting forth the effect of the Merger on such holders
rights pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the
grants of such Company Stock Options and that such Company Stock Options and
Company RSUs will continue in effect as the Converted Stock Options and
Converted Parent RSUs on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustment required by this Section 2.4 after giving effect to the Merger).

 

(h) Each outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under
any outstanding offering period as of the date of this Agreement under the
1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") shall terminate not later than
the day immediately prior to the day on which occurs the Effective Time,
provided that the Company may permit each participant in the ESPP to purchase
from the Company as many whole shares of Company Common Stock as the balance
of the participants account will allow, at the applicable price determined
under the terms of the ESPP for each such outstanding offering period, using
such date as the final purchase date for such offering period, and any amounts
remaining in any participants account after any such purchase will be
refunded to the participant.

 

Section 2.5 No Appraisal Rights. No appraisal rights will be available to the
stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger.

result in the imposition of a material penalty assessed pursuant to Section
502(i) of ERISA or a material tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each

Plan or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any
indemnification obligation.

collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to Sections 280G of the Code.

 

(k) The Israeli Sub does not have any material liability to the ITA with
respect to any Israeli Benefit Plan. The Israeli Sub has made adequate
provisions with respect to the payment of any payment under any Israeli
Benefit Plan, including severance pay provided under applicable Law, agreement
or otherwise, except for such payments that can be delayed in the ordinary
course of business as permitted under applicable Laws.

those extension orders that apply to all Israeli companies generally.

 

(e) There are no unwritten policies, practices or customs or any other
contracts, undertakings or agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries
that, by extension, could reasonably be expected to entitle any current or
former employee to benefits in addition to what such employee is entitled by
applicable legal requirements or under the terms of such employees
employment contract, except where such benefits, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

consultants, subcontractors or freelancers who, according to Israeli Law,
would be entitled to the rights of an employee vis-a-vis the Company or any

Rules") and/or the disclosure rules and transparency rules made by the
UKLA under Part VI of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (such rules

published by Parent since January 1, 2008 and (iv) in the case of Parent U.K.
Public Reports which were required by Law or by the UKLA to so be filed, did
not, at the time they were filed, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading. For the

to be made to a regulatory information service.

(b) Parent has timely filed with the SEC, and has made available to the

attestations required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when next due.

(e) No Subsidiary of Parent is required to file reports or other documents

-51-  (e) All material Parent Intellectual Property Rights were either (i) developed
or created by the employee or consultant of Parent or a Subsidiary of the
Parent within the scope of his or her employment or consultancy or (ii)
otherwise were the subject of an enforceable Contract concerning the
assignment or vesting of ownership of such Intellectual Property Rights in
the Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent and that included obligations of
confidentiality of such Person to the Parent or a Parent Subsidiary. All
amounts payable by or due Parent to all Persons, including current and former
employees, involved in the research, development, conception or reduction to
practice of any material Parent Intellectual Property Rights have been paid to
the extent that any such amount is due as of the date hereof. 

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any funding from
any Governmental Entity (including, for example, funding from OCS) or any
university, government-owned entity, college, other educational institution or
other not-for-profit for the development of any material Parent Intellectual

current or former employee, consultant or independent contractor of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries who is or was involved in, or who has or will have
contributed to, the creation or development of any material Parent
Intellectual Property Rights has performed services for, or was an employee
of, or was otherwise engaged (including as a graduate student) by any
Government Entity, university, government-owned institution, college, other
educational institution or other not-for-profit companies while such employee,

or any of its Subsidiaries and, solely or together with others, invented,
developed, or created or was involved in creation or development of any
material Parent Intellectual Property Rights.

(g) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
employees has, with authorization of Parent and on its behalf or on behalf of
its Subsidiaries, participated in, participates in, or is or was a member of
any, organization, body or group that is involved in setting, publishing or
developing any industry standards applicable to Parent Products in a manner
that (i) places any restrictions on, or requirement with respect to, the
licensing or enforcement of any material Parent Intellectual Property Rights
or (ii) after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will place any material restrictions on or any requirement with
respect to the licensing or enforcement of any material Parent Intellectual
Property Rights owned by Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has agreed to, or is otherwise obligated or required to,
license any Parent Intellectual Property Rights to any third party, or is
required to grant licenses on RAND or FRAND or ZRAND terms.

 



-52-  (h) To the Knowledge of Parent, neither the Parent Products nor the conduct of
the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, infringes, misappropriates or
otherwise violates any Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person in a
manner that has resulted in or is reasonably expected to result in a material
liability to the Parent or materially adversely affect the Parent or the
Parent Products. No material claims have been received in writing by the
Company within the previous three (3) years against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to Parents Knowledge, against any third party to whom
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has an indemnification obligation, alleging
that any Parent Product, or the conduct of the business of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates
any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person. No claims are pending, or
have been made within the three (3) years prior to the date hereof, by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries against a third party alleging that such third
party infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates any material Parent
Intellectual Property Rights.

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have good and legal title to, or have a valid
and enforceable right to use or a valid and enforceable leasehold interest
in, all real property (including all buildings, fixtures and other

condition or uncured default on the part of Parent or any such Subsidiary
exists under any material Parent Lease.

 

(c) Parent and its Subsidiaries have good and legal title to, or a valid and
enforceable leasehold interest in, all material personal assets used by them

would not reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. None of Parents and any of its Subsidiaries
ownership of or leasehold interest in any such personal assets is subject to
any material Liens.

(d) Parent or its Subsidiaries currently occupy all of the sites leased under
the Parent Leases (the "Parent Facilities") for the operation of their
business, and there are no other parties occupying, or with a right to
occupy, any of the Parent Facilities. The Parent Facilities are in condition
and repair suitable for the conduct of the business as presently conducted
therein, except where the failure to be in such suitable condition and repair
would not reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries

 



-53-   could reasonably be required to expend more than $250,000 in causing any
Parent Facilities to comply with the surrender conditions set forth in the
applicable Parent Lease.

 

Section 4.24 Permits; Compliance with Laws.

all material respects. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent
Permits is pending or threatened, and no such suspension or cancellation will
result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for any
suspensions or cancellations that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict in any material
respect with, or in default or material violation of, (i) any Laws applicable
to Parent or such Subsidiary or by which any of their assets are bound or (ii)
any Parent Permits.

benefits, labor or environmental matters, which matters are addressed in
Section 4.18, Section 4.19 and Section 4.21, respectively.

of the Governmental Entity which they represent or (c) unlawful payment from
corporate funds to obtain or retain any business.

summaries of their material insurance policies available to the Company.

than J.P. Morgan Cazenove and N.M. Rothschild and Sons Limited is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and owns no assets and has not engaged in any business activities or conducted
any operations other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by

to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 Registration Statement will,
in the case of the Form F-4 Registration Statement, at

Registration Statement or omit to state any material fact necessary to make

and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated in that Proxy Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in
that Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement (except for those portions of the
Proxy Statement that relate only to the Company and its Subsidiaries) and the
Form F-4 Registration Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act,
respectively.

Section 4.30 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor

extent required by this Agreement to be set forth in the Parent Disclosure
Letter or (iii) makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express
or implied, with respect to any projections, forecasts or other estimates,

or any of its Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of

conduct of business or operations of the Disclosing Party; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that the Disclosing Party shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information if the Disclosing Party determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or any
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize
the protection of an attorney-client privilege or expose the Disclosing Party
to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information. No
investigation conducted under this Section 5.3(a), however, will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made in this Agreement.
Further, this Section 5.3(a) shall not authorize any invasive or destructive
sampling or testing of, or at, any property.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other of all
material developments concerning any material Legal Action involving such
party or any of its Subsidiaries, including in relation to any efforts to

concerning such developments as the other party or its Representatives may
reasonably request; _provided_ , that neither party shall be obligated
to provide such access or information if it determines, in its reasonable
judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or any Contract or
obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize the
protection of an attorney-client privilege or expose such party to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information.

(c) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their

that each Person who has executed a confidentiality agreement with such party
in the 12-month period prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with
that Persons consideration of a Takeover Proposal with respect to such Party
return or destroy all non-public information furnished to that Person by or on
behalf of such party. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform its
Representatives of such partys obligations under this Section 5.4. Each of

party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with a Takeover Proposal with
respect to such party or under circumstances that would be reasonably likely
to lead to a Takeover Proposal with respect to such party. Each of Parent and

and a copy of such Takeover Proposal, indication or request (or, where

 



-60-   no such copy is available, a written summary of the material terms of such
Takeover Proposal). Each of Parent and the Company shall keep the other
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of any such Takeover
Proposal, indication or request, and any related communications to or by such

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, provided that
such party has complied and continues to comply in all material respects with
the provisions of this Section 5.4 and only until the Requisite Parent Vote
or Requisite Company Vote, as applicable, is obtained, Parent or the Company,
as applicable, and its board of directors may:

(i)(A) engage in discussions and negotiations with a Person who has made a
_bona fide_ unsolicited Takeover Proposal and (B) furnish or disclose any non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to such Person, in either
case if and only if (w) prior to furnishing or disclosing such information,
the Company or Parent, as applicable, has caused such Person to enter into a
confidentiality agreement with the Company or Parent, as applicable, on terms
and conditions that are substantially equivalent to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, provided that any such confidentiality agreement
contains provisions expressly permitting the Company or Parent, as applicable,
to comply with its obligations under this Agreement notwithstanding any
restrictions set forth therein (an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"),
(x) the Company or Parent, as applicable, concurrently discloses the same such
non-public information to Parent or the Company, as applicable (in each case,
to the extent not already disclosed)), and (y) in the case of the Company,
the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and the Companys outside
legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal either is a Superior Proposal or
would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, or in the case of
Parent, the board of directors of Parent determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Parent Financial Advisor and Parents outside legal
counsel, that such Takeover Proposal either is a Superior Proposal or would
be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal;

(ii)(x) withdraw, modify, qualify or amend the Parent Board Recommendation or
Company Board Recommendation, as the case may be, in a manner adverse to the
other party, in response to a _bona fide_ unsolicited Takeover Proposal with
respect to such party, (y) recommend such Takeover Proposal, or (z) terminate
this Agreement to enter into a Contract relating to such Takeover Proposal, in
each case if and only if (A) the board of directors of such party determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Parent Financial Advisor or the
Company Financial Advisor, as the case may be, and such partys outside legal
counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) such
partys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary and other duties of its directors; (C) such
party provides the other with three Business Days prior written notice of its
board of directors intention to take such action (including notice as to
whether such party intends to terminate this Agreement and enter into a
Contract with respect to such Superior Proposal), and (D) (1) during the
three Business Day period following receipt of such notice, if so requested by
the party receiving such notice, such party negotiates with and causes its
financial and legal advisors to negotiate with the other regarding potential
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement which might cause
such

 



-61-   Takeover Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and (2)
following the end of such three Business Day period, such partys board of
directors determines in good faith, after taking into account any proposed
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement offered in writing to
such party by the other in response to such notice or otherwise and after
consultation with the Parent Financial Advisor or the Company Financial
Advisor, as the case may be, and such partys outside legal counsel, that the
Superior Proposal giving rise to such notice continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would continue
to be inconsistent with the fiduciary and other duties of its directors
(provided that any material amendment to the financial terms of such Superior
Proposal shall not require a new notice and shall not require such party to
further comply with the requirements of this Section 5.4(d)(ii));

(iii) in the absence of a Takeover Proposal, withdraw, modify, qualify
or amend the Parent Board Recommendation or Company Board Recommendation, as
the case may be, in a manner adverse to the other party, if and only if (x)

contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company

purposes of eligibility and vesting and (ii) waive any pre-existing condition
limitation that might otherwise apply to such employee, under such plan,
program or arrangement to the extent waived or satisfied under the terms of a

individual

promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are for the sole benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person, other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of
this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependant thereof) in respect
of employment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing herein
shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability

director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Company Organizational Documents, or
any organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or in
agreements between an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its

respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and

Legal Action, whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in
part, (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party was a director or officer of the

Legal Action, Parent shall pay as incurred such Indemnified Partys legal
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such Legal Action,
subject to Parents receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Party to repay such legal fees, costs and expenses if it is

-68-  (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect for at least seven years after the Effective Time the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company, or
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the individuals covered by such
policies than the terms of such policies in effect on the date hereof ("DandO
Replacement Policy"), so long as Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not
required to pay an annual premium in excess of 200% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this
Agreement (the dollar amount of such percentage being the "Maximum Premium").
If Parent is unable to obtain, or unable to so cause to be obtained, the
insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to
the Maximum Premium, it shall instead obtain, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain, as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Any insurance obtained by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 5.10(c) shall not result in
gaps in coverage. The Company represents and agrees that the Maximum Premium
as of the date hereof is $774,000. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may, and after the Effective Time, Parent may, obtain one or more seven year
prepaid "tail policy" or policies in lieu of the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company
applicable from and after the Effective Time to the acts and omissions of
directors and officers of the Company up to and including the Effective Time
and providing the same coverage and amounts and terms and conditions as such
current policies (collectively, the "DandO Tail Policy"). Parent shall not take
any action to terminate the DandO Replacement Policy or the DandO Tail Policy
during such seven-year period, and any insurance obtained by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 5.10(c) shall not result in
gaps in coverage. If such DandO Tail Policy is obtained, Parent shall not
be obligated to obtain the DandO Replacement Policy.

the actions specified in Section 5.11 of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

Section 5.12 Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions

proper or advisable to cause the conditions set forth in Article VI to be

necessary filings, applications and notifications, and thereafter make any
other submissions either required or deemed appropriate by each of the parties

the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market, the London Stock

basis if appropriate) all information required for any such filing,
application, notification, or other submission. Subject to applicable Laws or
the requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, the London Stock Exchange or the
Financial Services Authority, neither Parent nor the Company shall file any
such document if the other party has reasonably objected to the filing of such
document. As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Company
shall file (i) with the OCS, an application for the approval of the change of
ownership of the Company to be effected by the Merger (the "OCS Approval") and
(ii) with the Investment Center for an approval of the change in ownership of

receipt of any communication from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department
of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent or the Company (or any of their
respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional information from any
such Governmental Entity that is related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, then such party shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, a response
in full compliance with such request. The parties shall also consult
and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Competition Law. Without

participate in such meeting, (C) to the extent practicable, give each other
reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral communications with any
Governmental Entity relating to any Competition Law, (D) if any Governmental
Entity initiates a substantive oral communication regarding any competition
Law, promptly notify the other party of the substance of such communication,
(E) provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and
comment upon all written communications (including any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) with a
Governmental Entity regarding the notification required under the HSR Act and
(F) provide each other with copies of all written communications to or from
any Governmental Entity relating to the HSR Act. Any such disclosures or
provision of copies by one party to the other may be made on an outside
counsel basis if appropriate. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, but subject to Section 5.13(c), and

 



-70-   unless the boards of directors of the Company and Parent mutually agree
otherwise, each of the parties shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, take any and all actions necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or
approvals required under or in connection with any Competition Law and to
enable all waiting periods under any Competition Law to expire, and to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law asserted by any
Governmental Entity, in each case, to cause the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby to occur as promptly as possible, including
but not limited to (i) promptly complying with or modifying any requests for
additional information (including any second request) by any Governmental
Entity, (ii) if necessary to obtain clearance by any Governmental Entity as

and its Subsidiaries or committing to any restrictions on its business and
(iii) contesting, defending and appealing any threatened or pending
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or
statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the
ability of any party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and taking any and all other actions to prevent the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.13 will require,
or be construed to require, Parent or the Company to agree to (i) sell, hold
separate, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the Effective Time,
any assets, businesses or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates or (ii) any conditions relating
to, or changes or restriction in, the operations of any such assets or
businesses which, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), would reasonably
be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the business of
Parent and the Company, taken together, as expected to be conducted after the
Effective Time.

Section 5.14 Qualification as a Reorganization.

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury Regulations. From and after
the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each of Parent and
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify, and shall not, without the prior written consent of the other party,
knowingly take any actions or cause any actions to be taken which could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code or cause
gain to be recognized by any of the stockholders of the Company upon the
exchange of Company Common stock for ADSs in the Merger (other than a Company
stockholder who is a "Five-Percent Transferee Shareholder" within the meaning
of the rules under Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c) and who does not
file the agreement described in Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B)). Following the Effective Time, and consistent with
any such consent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of its
Affiliates, shall knowingly take any action or cause any action to be taken
which would cause the Merger to fail to so qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent and the Company shall timely
satisfy or cause to be satisfied the reporting requirements contained in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6).

immediately available funds an amount equal to $12,200,000 (subject to any
reduction in its payment obligation under Section 7.5(f)) if:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(e), such
payment to be made before or concurrently with such termination and in the
absence of such payment any such purported termination shall be invalid;

 



-82-  (ii)(A) a Takeover Proposal in respect of Parent has been publicly made or
proposed to the Parents stockholders or otherwise publicly announced
(whether or not conditional) and not withdrawn, (B) this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(c) and (C)
within six months following the date of such termination, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries enters into a Contract providing for the implementation of a
Takeover Proposal in respect of Parent (which Takeover Proposal is ultimately
consummated) or consummates any Takeover Proposal in respect of Parent,
whether or not such Takeover Proposal was the same Takeover Proposal referred
to in clause (A), such payment to be made upon the consummation of such
Takeover Proposal;

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.4(a),
such payment to be made within two Business Days of such termination, unless
at the time of the Companys termination Parent has the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(d), in which case no amount shall be
payable pursuant to this Section 7.5(d)(iii); or 

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.4(b),
such payment to be made within two Business Days of such termination.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not
be required to pay to the Company the amount due pursuant to this Section
7.5(d) more than once.

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in this
Section 7.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) without these agreements, the parties would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either party fails promptly to
pay any amount payable by it pursuant to this Section 7.5, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for the payment set forth in
this Section 7.5, the non-paying party shall pay to the other party its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees, charges and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount due from each
date for payment until the date of such payment at the prime rate of Citibank
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2
percent.

(f) The parties to this Agreement intend, and shall use all reasonable
endeavors to secure, that any amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.5(c) and
Section 7.5(d) are not treated for VAT purposes as consideration for a
taxable supply. In circumstances where a payment falls to be made in
accordance with Section 7.5(c) or Section 7.5(d), if and to the extent that
any relevant Tax authority determines that the amount which would otherwise
be payable pursuant to Section 7.5(c) or Section 7.5(d) but for the adjustment
required pursuant to this section 7.5(f) (each, a "Termination Fee") is
consideration for a taxable supply, that the party paying the Termination Fee
(or the representative member of a VAT Group of which that party is a member)
is liable to account to a Tax authority for VAT in respect of such supply and
all or any part of such VAT is Irrecoverable VAT, then: 

 



-83-  (i) the amount payable by such party pursuant to Section 7.5(c) or Section
7.5(d) shall be reduced so that the amount payable, together with any
Irrecoverable VAT arising in respect of the supply for which the payment is
consideration, is equal to the Termination Fee; and

 

(ii) to the extent that such party has already paid an amount in respect of
the Termination Fee which exceeds the amount described in Section 7.5(f)(i)
above, the other party shall repay to such party such amount as will ensure
that the aggregate amount paid by such party pursuant to Section 7.5(c) or
Section 7.5(d), together with the Irrecoverable VAT mentioned in Section
7.5(f)(i) above and less the repayment mentioned in this Section 7.5(f)(ii),
is equal to the Termination Fee.

 

Section 7.6 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this
Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time, so long as (a) no
amendment that requires stockholder or shareholder approval under applicable
Laws shall be made without such required approval and (b) such amendment has
been duly approved by the board of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties to this Agreement.

Section 7.7 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered under
this Agreement or, (c) subject to applicable Laws, waive compliance with any
of the covenants or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on
the part of a party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure or delay
of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Agreement), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties,
both written and oral, among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. No representation, warranty, inducement,
promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been
made or relied upon by any of the parties to this Agreement.

 



-87-  Section 8.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section
5.10, this Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon
any Person other than the parties to this Agreement.

 

Section 8.9 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that provision in
order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of
this Agreement and the application of that provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of that provision, or the application of that provision, in
any other jurisdiction.

Section 8.10 Rules of Construction. The parties to this Agreement have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and waive the application of any Laws or rule of construction providing that
ambiguities in any agreement or other document shall be construed against the
party drafting such agreement or other document.

Section 8.11 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation
of law or otherwise, except that Parent may designate, by written notice to
the Company, a Subsidiary that is wholly-owned by Parent to be merged with and
into the Company in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references in this
Agreement to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such Subsidiary, and in
that case, all representations and warranties made in this Agreement with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such Subsidiary as of the
date of such designation.

Section 8.12 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

 

Section 8.13 Specific Performance. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties to this
Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, and neither party shall oppose any motion
or other action seeking any such injunction to enforce Section 8.4.

 

Section 8.14 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, all of which shall be one and the same agreement.
This Agreement shall become

 



-88-   effective when each party to this Agreement has received counterparts signed
by all of the other parties.

Section 8.15 Parent Assurance. Parent agrees to cause Merger Sub to comply
with all of its obligations hereunder and shall be fully responsible for any
failure of Merger Sub to comply with its obligations hereunder to the same
extent as if Parent were directly obligated.
