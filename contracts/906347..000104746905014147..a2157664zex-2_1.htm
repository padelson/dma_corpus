## 

  

### **3.1.1** ** **for the Communications Shares:

hundred and thirty eight thousand euro) (the **"Networks Consideration"** ),

  

### 

  

(the Communications Consideration and the Networks Consideration together

## **3.2** ** **At Completion, the Buyer shall pay the Consideration plus the
amount of the estimated adjustment referred to in clause 3.5 to such bank
accounts as NGL (as agent for the Sellers) shall specify by written notice to
the Buyer prior to execution of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

 **Consideration for the Additional Assets**

  



  

## **3.3** ** **The consideration for the sale of the Additional Assets shall

## 

  

 **Consideration Adjustment**

  



  

## **3.4** ** **The Consideration shall be subject to adjustment on the
following basis (such basis being the **"Consideration Adjustment"** ):

  

## 

  

### **3.4.1** ** **if the amount of Completion Cash is greater than the
amount of Completion Indebtedness (in each case as shown in the Adjustment
Statement), the Consideration shall be increased by the amount of the Net
Cash; or

  

### 

  

### **3.4.2** ** **if the amount of Completion Cash is less than the amount
of Completion Indebtedness (in each case as shown in the Adjustment
Statement), the Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of the Net Cash,

  

### 

  

## PROVIDED THAT if the Net Working Capital as shown in the Adjustment
Statement is more negative than (28,800,000) (negative twenty eight million
eight hundred thousand euro), then the amount of the Consideration (as
adjusted pursuant to sub-clauses 3.4.1 or 3.4.2 above) shall be reduced
by the amount of such excess. By way of example: (a) if Net Working Capital
is (28,900,000) (negative twenty eight million nine hundred thousand euro),
the Consideration shall be reduced by 100,000 (one hundred thousand euro),
whereas (b) if Net Working Capital is (28,700,000) (negative twenty eight
million seven hundred thousand euro), there will be no reduction in the
Consideration by reference to the Net Working Capital).

 **Initial Consideration Adjustment**

  



  

## **3.5** ** **NGL (as agent for the Sellers) estimates that the adjustment
to be made pursuant to clause 3.4 shall result in an increase of 8,412,000
(eight million four hundred and twelve thousand euro) in the Consideration to
be paid by the Buyer (such estimated increase being the
**"Initial Consideration Adjustment"** ) and the Consideration payable by
the Buyer pursuant to clause 3.2 shall be increased accordingly.

Consideration Indebtedness and Net Working Capital shown in the Adjustment
Statement (as agreed or deemed agreed) to determine the definitive amount of
the adjustments to be made to the Consideration, and:

  

## 

  

### **3.6.1** ** **if the calculation of the Consideration as adjusted
pursuant to clause 3.4 by reference to the Adjustment Statement (as agreed or
deemed agreed) is more than the Consideration paid as adjusted pursuant to

the Sellers an amount equal to the difference by way of further adjustment to
the Consideration; or

  

### 

  

### **3.6.2** ** **if the calculation of the Consideration as adjusted

### **3.7.1** ** **the Completion Cash and the Completion Indebtedness; and

  

### 

  

### **3.7.2** ** **the Net Working Capital,

20   

     
   

  



  

### of the requirements, accounting policies and accounting methods set out

same) format as the Pro-Forma Adjustment Statement set out in Part I of
Schedule 7.

  

### 

  

## **3.8** ** **The Buyer and the Sellers agree that the sole purpose of the
Adjustment Statement is to determine the Completion Cash, the Completion
Indebtedness and the Net Working Capital. The Adjustment Statement is not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation
methodology for the purposes of determining the Completion Cash,
the Completion Indebtedness and/or the Net Working Capital from those used in
the preparation of the Accounts (other than to the extent provided in
Schedule 7).

  

## 

  

## **3.9** ** **When the draft Adjustment Statement has been prepared, NGL
shall as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter deliver a copy of such
statement to the Buyer together with certificates of the Completion Cash, the
Completion Indebtedness and the Net Working Capital.  The Buyer and its
accountants shall then have a period of twenty (20) Business Days after the
date on which NGL delivers the draft Adjustment Statement to the Buyer (the
**"Review Period"** ) within which to review the draft Adjustment Statement.
The Buyer shall, before the expiry of the Review Period, either:

  

## 

  

### **3.9.1** ** **confirm in writing to NGL that it agrees that the draft
Adjustment Statement has been duly prepared and that the value of the
Completion Cash, the Completion Indebtedness and/or the Net Working Capital
has been correctly certified; or

  

### 

  

### **3.9.2** ** **give notice in writing to NGL explaining, in reasonable
detail, why it disagrees that the Adjustment Statement has been duly prepared
and that the value of the Completion Cash, the Completion Indebtedness and/or
the Net Working Capital has been correctly certified and setting out details
of its proposed adjustments to the draft Adjustment Statement and to the
value of the Completion Cash, the Completion Indebtedness and/or the Net
Working Capital (if any); provided that the Buyer may only give such notice
pursuant to this sub-clause 3.9.2 if the aggregate value of its proposed
adjustments to the Completion Cash, the Completion Indebtedness and the Net
Working Capital exceeds 200,000 (two hundred thousand euro).

  

### 

  

## **3.10** ** **If the Buyer fails to give the confirmation or notice in
accordance with clause 3.9, the draft Adjustment Statement and the
certificates of the Completion Cash, the Completion Indebtedness and/or the
Net Working Capital (as applicable) as delivered by NGL pursuant to clause
3.9 shall, upon expiry of the Review Period, be deemed to have been finally
accepted and agreed by the parties.

## **3.11** ** **If the Buyer serves a valid notice in accordance with clause
3.9.2

  



  

21   

       

  



  

### **3.11.1** ** **the parties shall endeavour to resolve all matters in
dispute as soon as practicable. If they fail to resolve such matters within
twenty (20) Business Days of the date on which NGL receives such notice from
the Buyer (or such longer period as NGL and the Buyer shall agree) (the
**"Resolution Period"** ), the matters shall be referred for final
determination to a team within Ernst and Young LLP which do not provide
directly any audit or other services to either the NTL Group or the Buyer
Group. If such firm is unable to serve, the Buyer and NGL shall jointly
select an expert from an accounting firm of national standing in the UK that
is not the independent auditor of either the Buyer or NGL (or any member of
the Buyer Group or the NTL Group). If NGL and the Buyer fail to make such
appointment within the ten (10) Business Days of the end of the Resolution
Period (the **"Appointment Period"** ), the appointment shall be made on
behalf of NGL and the Buyer by the President for the time being of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales as soon as
practicable after the expiry of the Appointment Period, on the application of
either NGL or the Buyer.  Such accountant shall be instructed to determine
the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this clause 3 and to make
such determination as soon as practicable and in any event within thirty (30)
Business Days of his being instructed. Such accountant shall only consider
those items and amounts set forth in the Adjustment Statement as to which the
Buyer and NGL have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms
specified above, and shall select as a resolution the position of either the
Buyer or NGL for each item of disagreement (based solely on presentations and
supporting material provided by the parties and not pursuant to
any independent review). Such accountant shall not impose an alternative
resolution.  In making such determination, such accountant shall act as an
expert and not as an arbitrator and his decision shall (in the absence of
manifest error) be final and binding on the parties. The costs of such
accountant shall be borne by the Sellers and the Buyer in such proportions as
he may direct, or in the absence of any such direction, as to one half by the
Buyer and as to the other half by the Sellers; and

  

### 

  

### **3.11.2** ** **save as provided in clause 3.11.1, the parties shall bear
their own costs in connection with the resolution of the matters in dispute.

  

### 

  

## **3.12** ** **The Buyer and its accountants shall be entitled to examine
the working papers relating to the draft Adjustment Statement for the
purposes of their review under clause 3.9. The Buyer agrees that it will
promptly upon request provide NGL and its advisers with access to or copies
of all accounting information and other information relating to the
operations and affairs of the Target Group in its possession or control or in
the possession or control of the Buyer and such access to the personnel and
records of the Target Group, as may be relevant for the purposes of preparing
the first draft of the Adjustment Statement within the timetable envisaged by
this clause 3, or as may reasonably be required to facilitate
the determination of any dispute in relation thereto.

  



  

22   

     
   

  



  

## **3.13** ** **Any Final Adjustment Payment shall be paid by the Buyer or
the Sellers, as applicable, in accordance with clause 3.6 in cash in euro by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the party entitled to receive such payment together with an amount
equal to the interest which would have accrued on the amount of such
reduction or increase from the Completion Date to the date of such payment
thereof if interest had been payable at the per annum rate equal to the 6
month London Interbank Offer Rate on the Completion Date, as published in The
Wall Street Journal.

  

## 

  

## **3.14** ** **The Sellers and the Buyer agree that any increase or
reduction in the Consideration by way of Initial Consideration Adjustment
and/or any payment made to or by them by way of Final Adjustment Payment
shall be apportioned between the Sellers in such manner as fairly reflects
the cause of the relevant adjustment (save that no additional amount shall be
attributed to the Assets Consideration). If the parties disagree as to how
the adjustment is apportioned, it shall be resolved in the same manner as the
dispute resolution provisions in clause 3.11.

General Counsel of NTL Incorporated (on behalf of the Sellers and NGL).

  



  

 **2.** ** TIME LIMITS**

  



  

 **2.1** None of the Sellers shall be liable for any claim unless written

99   

     
   

  



  

made reasonable enquiries) and the Buyers _bona fide_ estimate of any alleged
loss (to the extent reasonably ascertainable by the Buyer).

  



  

 **2.3** Any claim shall be deemed to be withdrawn (if it has not been
previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) and any claim in relation to the
same fact, matter, event or circumstance shall be deemed to be waived unless
legal proceedings in respect of such claim have been commenced within six (6)
months of the giving of written notice of the claim, and for this purpose
such legal proceedings shall not be deemed to have commenced unless both

 **3.1** ** **32,500,000 (thirty two million, five hundred thousand euro)

PROVIDED THAT the aggregate liability of the Sellers for claims which are the
subject of sub-clauses 3.1 and 3.2 shall not exceed 56,875,000 (fifty six
million, eight hundred and seventy five thousand euro); and

  



  

 **3.3** ** **the amount of the Aggregate Consideration in respect of a claim
under the Tax Deed,

  



  

PROVIDED THAT the aggregate liability of the Sellers for all claims and any
claims under the Tax Deed shall in no circumstances exceed the amount of the
Aggregate Consideration.

  



  

100   

     
   

  



  

For the purposes of these limits, the liability of the Sellers shall be
deemed to include the amount of all costs, expenses and other liabilities
(together with any irrecoverable VAT thereon) payable by the Sellers in
connection with the satisfaction, settlement or determination of any such
claim.

  



  

 **4.** ** LOWER LIMITS**

  



  

### **4.1** Neither of the Sellers shall be liable for any claim (other than
a claim under the Warranty in paragraph 4 of Part V (Liabilities) and the
Warranties in paragraph 10 of Part XI (Employees) of Schedule 3) unless the
aggregate amount of such claim, when taken together with the amount of all
other claims against the Sellers, exceeds 5,000,000 (five million euro) (the
**"Threshold"** ), in which event the Sellers shall, subject to the other
limits contained in this Schedule, be liable only for the amount by which
such aggregate amount exceeds the Threshold.

  

### 

  

 **4.2** Neither of the Sellers shall be liable for any claim (other than a
claim under the Warranty in paragraph 4 of Part V (Liabilities) and the
Warranties in paragraph 10 of Part XI (Employees) of Schedule 3) which does
not exceed 100,000 (one hundred thousand euro) (a **"De Minimis Claim"** )
and no such De Minimis Claim shall count towards the Threshold.

  



  

 **4.3** For the purposes of calculating claims counting towards the
Threshold and/or any De Minimis Claim:

  



  

 **4.3.1** there shall be excluded from any claim the amount of any costs,
expenses and other liabilities (together with any irrecoverable VAT thereon)
incurred or to be incurred by any member of the Buyer Group in connection
with the making of any such claim; and

  



  

 **4.3.2** there shall be excluded the amount of any other claim in respect
of the same fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to the same loss.

  



  

 **5.** ** DOUBLE CLAIMS**

  



  

 **5.1** Neither of the Sellers shall be liable for any breach of the
Warranties to the extent that the loss occasioned by the fact, matter, event
or circumstance giving rise to such breach is (1) recovered under the Tax
Deed or any other provisions of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the Consideration Adjustment); or (2) recovered under any of the
other agreements to be entered into pursuant to this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the Ancillary Agreements).

  



  

 **5.2** Neither of the Sellers shall be liable for any claim under the Tax
Deed or any other provisions of this Agreement or any of the other agreements
to be entered into pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent that the loss
occasioned by the fact, matter, event or

  



  

101   

     
   

  



  

circumstance giving rise to such claim is recovered under the Warranties or
under any other such provisions.

  



  

 **5.3** If the same fact, matter, event or circumstance gives rise to more
than one claim, no member of the Buyer Group shall be entitled to recover
more than once under any of the Transaction Documents in respect of the loss
occasioned by such fact, matter, event or circumstance.

  



  

 **6.** ** PROVISIONS AND RESERVES**

  



  

Neither of the Sellers shall be liable for any claim to the extent that:

  



  

 **6.1** any specific provision or reserve has been made in the Accounts or
in the Adjustment Statement or in Net Working Capital in respect of the fact,
matter, event or circumstance giving rise to such claim; or

  



  

 **6.2** any specific provision or reserve made in any of the Accounts in
respect of the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to such claim
is insufficient by reason of any change to legislation, any increase in rates
of taxation or any change in the published practice of a revenue authority,
in each case made on and/or after todays date.

  



  

 **7.** ** REDUCTIONS**

  



  

 **7.1** For the purposes of this paragraph 7, a **"Reduction"**  shall mean
the amount of any benefit (including a Taxation benefit) accruing to any
member of the Buyer Group as a consequence of the fact, matter, event
or circumstance giving rise to the claim.

  



  

 **7.2** If a Reduction exists at the time when any payment is due to be made
by the relevant Seller in respect of a claim:

  



  

 **7.2.1** the amount of the Reduction shall first be set-off against such
payment;

  



  

 **7.2.2** to the extent that after such set-off any balance of the Reduction
amount (the **"Balance"** ) remains, a refund shall be made to the
relevant Seller of any previous payment or payments made by it in respect of
any claims which have not already been refunded under this paragraph up to
the amount of the Balance; and

  



  

 **7.2.3** to the extent that the Balance is not exhausted under paragraph
7.2.2 above, the remainder of the Balance shall be carried forward and set-
off against any future payment or payments which become due from such Seller
in respect of any claim.

  



  

102   

     
   

  



  

 **8.** ** CHANGES ON AND/OR AFTER THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT**

  



  

Neither of the Sellers shall be liable for any claim to the extent that it
arises, or is increased or extended by:

  



  

 **8.1** any change to legislation, any decision of any court or tribunal,
any increase in rates of taxation, any introduction of new taxation or any
change in the published practice of a revenue authority, in each case made on
and/or after todays date;

  



  

 **8.2** any change in the accounting reference date of any member of the
Buyer Group made on and/or after Completion;

 **8.4** ** **any cessation of, or any change in, the nature or conduct of
any business carried on by any member of the Buyer Group being a cessation or

or doing of which could have been performed notwithstanding the sale of the
Shares and which was taken into account in computing the provision or reserve
for taxation in the Accounts;

  



  

 **8.6** any member of the Buyer Group waiving or surrendering on and/or
after Completion any exemption, relief, allowance, credit deduction or set
off (which is not a Buyers Relief (as defined in the Tax Deed)) available to
it relevant to the computation of any liability to taxation or any credit
against taxation; or

  



  

 **8.7** any act, omission or transaction outside the ordinary and usual
course of business which is carried out or effected prior to Completion by,
or at the request or with the approval of any member of the Buyer Group (or

act, omission or transaction is required to comply with a legally binding
commitment of any Target Group Company entered into prior to Completion.

  



  

 **9.** ** THIRD PARTY CLAIMS**

  



  

In respect of any fact, matter, event or circumstance which comes to the
notice of the Buyer which would, could or might result in a claim against any
member of the Target Group (a **"Third Party Claim"** ) and which, in turn,
would, could or might result in a claim against either of the Sellers, the
Buyer shall and shall procure that each member of the Target Group shall:

  



  

103   

     
   

  



  

 **9.1** as soon as reasonably practicable give written notice and reasonable
details of the Third Party Claim to the relevant Seller;

  



  

 **9.2** not settle or compromise the Third Party Claim or make any admission
in respect thereof without the prior written consent of the relevant Seller;

  



  

 **9.3** allow the relevant Seller and its advisers and agents to investigate
the Third Party Claim (including whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect thereof);

  



  

 **9.4** consult in good faith with the relevant Seller as to any ways in
which the Third Party Claim might be avoided, disputed, resisted, mitigated,
settled, compromised, defended or appealed;

  



  

 **9.5** take such action, at the written request of the relevant Seller, as
such Seller may reasonably require to avoid, dispute, resist, mitigate,
settle, compromise, defend or appeal the Third Party Claim;

  



  

 **9.6** permit the relevant Seller, at its written request and subject to
the relevant Seller agreeing with the relevant member of the Target Group (to
its reasonable satisfaction) to indemnify and pay to it an amount equal to
all additional losses, claims, demands, costs and reasonable expenses
(including reasonable legal costs) arising from the relevant Sellers conduct
of such proceedings, to have sole conduct of all proceedings relating to the
Third Party Claim in the name of the relevant member of the Target Group, and

 **9.7** take all reasonable action to mitigate any loss suffered by any
member of the Buyer Group;

confidentiality agreements on reasonable terms) all such information and
assistance (including access to properties, management, records, papers,
documents and data) as they may reasonably require; and

  



  

 **9.9** not require the relevant Seller to make any payment in respect of
any claim until the Third Party Claim has been satisfied, settled, determined
or withdrawn.

  



  

 **10.** ** NON-ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS**

  



  

Save as provided in clause 16, the Buyer shall not, and shall procure that no
other member of the Buyer Group shall, assign or declare a trust over the
benefit of any claim.

  



  

104   

     
   

  



  

 **11.** ** CHANGE OF CONTROL ETC**

  



  

If Completion occurs, neither of the Sellers shall be liable for any claim
arising from any loss suffered or payment made by any member of the Buyer
Group which would not have been suffered or made had such company not given
warranties and/or indemnities, to any other person acquiring, directly or
indirectly, all or part of the shares, assets or undertaking of any Target
Group Company or all or part of the Irish Cable Business.

  



  

 **12.** ** REMEDIABLE BREACHES**

  



  

 **12.1** ** **Neither of the Sellers shall be liable for any claim to the
extent that the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to such claim
is remedied by or at the sole expense of the relevant Seller within sixty
(60) Business Days of the date on which written notice of such claim is given
to the Sellers and the Buyer shall, and shall procure that each member of the
Buyer Group shall, co-operate with the Sellers where reasonably necessary (at
the relevant Sellers expense in respect of any third party costs incurred by
any member of the Buyer Group at such Sellers request) to enable them to
remedy any such fact, matter, event or circumstance. Subject to paragraph
12.2 below, the subject matter of a valid claim is the failure of any Target
Group Company to own or have use of an asset, the Sellers may elect to remedy
any actionable claim by the transfer of their interest in such asset to a
Target Group Company.

  



  

 **12.2** ** **In the event that the Sellers elect to remedy any such claim
by the transfer to the relevant Target Group Company of the interest of any
member of the NTL Group in such asset, the Buyer shall co-operate fully with
the Sellers for such purpose and if requested by the relevant Seller:

  



  

 **12.2.1** ** **the Buyer shall procure that **** the relevant Target Group
Company shall pay in cash to the relevant member of the NTL Group (or as it
may direct) an amount equal to the fair market value of the interest in such
asset upon it being transferred (plus VAT if applicable); and

  



  

 **12.2.2** ** **immediately following any payment by a Target Group Company
pursuant to paragraph 12.2.1 above, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer an
amount equal to the fair market value of the interest in such asset by way of
an adjustment to the Consideration.

  



  

 **13.** ** THIRD PARTY RECOVERY**

  



  

 **13.1** Neither of the Sellers shall be liable for any claim if any member
of the Buyer Group is insured against any loss, damage or liability which is
the basis of such claim under the terms of any insurance policy unless and
until the insured company has made a claim against the insurers under such
policy for the amount recoverable under such policy on such claim (unless the
policy is in the name of Morgan Stanley or any subsidiary for the time being
of Morgan Stanley, in which event this paragraph 13.1 shall not apply in
respect of such

  



  

105   

     
   

  



  

policy).  The amount recoverable under the claim shall be reduced by any
amount which is recovered under such policy.

  



  

 **13.2** Save as provided in paragraph 13.1, should any claim have been paid
under this Schedule by either of the Sellers and, after such payment, any
members of the Buyer Group should recover part or all of such claim from a
third party, the Buyer shall procure that such member of the Buyer Group
shall pay over the amount so recovered (net of costs of recovery and any
Taxation suffered by the Buyer or any member of the Buyers Group) to the
Seller.

  



  

 **14.** ** UNASCERTAINABLE CLAIMS**

  



  

Neither of the Sellers shall be liable to make any payment in respect of a
claim which arises by reason of a liability which, at the time when written
notice of the claim is given to the relevant Seller, is contingent only or is
otherwise not capable of being quantified:

  



  

 **14.1** unless and until the liability becomes an actual liability or (as
the case may be) becomes capable of being quantified; and

  



  

 **14.2** unless the liability becomes an actual liability on or before the
sixth anniversary of the Completion Date.

  



  

 **15.** **MITIGATION**

  



  

The Buyer shall, and shall procure that each member of the Target Group
shall, take all reasonable action to mitigate any loss suffered by it which
would or might reasonably be expected to result in a claim against either of
the Sellers and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing shall, in
respect of any right of recovery (whether by payment, discount, credit,
relief or otherwise) which could or might be made by it against any third
party:

  



  

 **15.1** ** **give written notice and reasonable details of such right of
recovery to the relevant Seller as soon as reasonably practicable; and

  



  

 **15.2** ** **take reasonable steps to maximise the amount recovered in
respect of such right of recovery.

  



  

 **16.** ** REDUCTION IN CONSIDERATION**

  



  

Any amount paid by either of the Sellers in respect of any claim shall so far
as possible be treated as a reduction in the relevant consideration payable
to such Seller as contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

106   

     
   

  



  

 **17.** ** TAX DEED**

  



  

If any limits on the liability of the Sellers under the Tax Deed conflict
with the provisions of this Schedule 4 then the provisions of the Tax Deed
shall prevail.

  



  

 **18.** **CURRENCY EQUIVALENT**

  



  

 **18.1** For the purposes of determining whether the monetary limits
referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 above apply, liabilities in a currency
other than euro shall be converted into euro at the noon buying rate as
quoted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the date of Completion.

  



  

 **18.2** Any payments to be made under this Agreement or any other agreement
to be entered into pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation,
the Tax Deed) by or to any member of the NTL Group shall be in euro.
Where any such payments are to be made and the underlying liability has
been calculated in a currency other than euro, the underlying liability shall
be converted into euro at the noon buying rate as quoted by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York on last Business Day prior to the date of payment.

  



  

 **19.** ** ****MAKE WHOLE PAYMENTS**

  



  

If the Buyer or any member of the Buyer Group receives or is entitled to any
payment pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement of todays date between,
among others, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Equity Funding, Inc. and UPC Ireland
B.V. (the **"Payment"** ) nothing in this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents shall:

  



  

 **19.1** require the Buyer or any member of the Buyer Group to claim the
Payment or to pay the Payment (or an amount in respect of the Payment) to the
Sellers or any member of the NTL Group;

  



  

 **19.2** ** **exclude or limit the liability of the Sellers or any member of
the NTL Group hereunder on (direct or indirect) grounds based on the Payment
or the right to a Payment; or

  



  

 **19.3** ** **give rise to (or constitute) any credit or saving for the
benefit of the Sellers or any member of the NTL Group as a direct or indirect
consequence of the Payment or the right to a Payment.
