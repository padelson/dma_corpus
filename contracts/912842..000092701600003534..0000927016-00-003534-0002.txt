"Plans") are incompliance with all applicable laws, including the Code and ERISA
 -----
to the extent applicable and the laws of any applicable foreign jurisdiction,
except for any noncompliance that would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or materially burden or materially impair the ability of the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
Compensation and Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms
and the requirements of ERISA and the Code, to the extent applicable. Each Plan
that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and that is intended to be qualified under Section
          ------------
401(a) of the Code has received or is the subject of a favorable determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to "TRA" (as
defined in Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 93-39) and no such determination letter has
been revoked and revocation has not been threatened, and no act or omission has
occurred that is reasonably likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
letter. As of the date hereof, there is no audit or investigation by any
Governmental Entity underway, and there are no termination proceedings or to the
knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, other claims (except claims
for benefits payable in the ordinary course) suits or proceedings threatened
against or involving any Compensation and Benefit Plans that would give rise to
any liability. Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries, nor any

                                       12
<PAGE>

employee, officer or director thereof, nor, any third-party with respect to
Compensation and Benefit Plans, has engaged or failed to engage in any conduct
with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that could subject the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to any material fine, penalty, tax or liability of
any kind under the Code or ERISA or could require indemnification by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (c)  Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has
ever maintained a Compensation and Benefit Plan subject to Section 412 of the
Code or Title IV of ERISA. At no time has the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate been obligated to contribute to any "multiemployer plan" as
defined in ERISA.

          (d)  All contributions required to be made under the terms of any
Compensation and Benefit Plan as of the date hereof have been timely made.

          (e)  Except as required by Code Section 4980B or any similar state
law, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree
health and life benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan nor any
unfunded obligation under any other Compensation and Benefit Plan for post-
employment benefits. The Company, its Subsidiaries and its ERISA Affiliates have
at all times complied with the continuation coverage requirements of Code
Section 4980B, or similar state law.

          (f)  The consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (w) entitle any Employees to severance
pay, (x) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans, (y) result in any breach
or violation of, or a default under, any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans,
or (z) provide any payment that may be subject to the tax imposed by Section
4999 of the Code or included in the determination of such person's "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code.

          (g)  No Compensation and Benefit Plan or related documentation
prohibits the Company or any Subsidiary from amending or terminating such
Compensation and Benefit Plan. No Compensation and Benefit Plan is funded by,
associated with or related to a "voluntary employee's beneficiary association"
within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

          (h)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 5.8, the representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.8,
other than the representations and warranties set forth in paragraph (f) above,
shall be deemed to be true and correct unless such failures to be true and

conducted in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, decree, arbitration
award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental Entity

or materially burden or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and its
Subsidiaries each has all permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions,
orders and other governmental authorizations, consents and approvals ("Permits")
                                                                       -------
from Governmental Entities necessary to conduct its business as presently
conducted, except for those the absence of which would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially burden or materially impair the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
the Permits, except where the failure to so comply, individually or in the
aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

effectiveness, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

               ---------------
not in default under any of the Company Leases, except where the existence of
such defaults, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and is not
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
Leases is in full force and effect and will not cease to be in full force and
effect as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     5.12. Environmental Matters.

resulted in, and are not reasonably likely to result in, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The tangible assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken

to them, which cessation or decrease, individually or in the aggregate, is

Company is a party or subject to that has or could reasonably be expected to
have the effect of prohibiting or impairing the conduct of the business by the

<PAGE>

          Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined).  Parent has made available to
the Company a complete and correct copy of Parent's and the Merger Sub's article
of organization and bylaws (or comparable governing instruments), as amended
and/or restated to the date hereof.  Parent's and its Subsidiaries' articles of

                                                    -----------------------
Effect" means a material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties,
------
business or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole; provided, however, that any such effect resulting from any change (i) in
law, rule, or regulation or GAAP or interpretations thereof (ii) in economic or
business conditions generally or in the industries of the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries specifically in a manner not disproportionate to the manner in
which such conditions affect other companies generally or other companies in the
industries of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or
(iii) as a proximate result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the contemplated consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall not
be considered when determining if a Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

          -----------------

          The authorized capital stock of the Parent consists of 50,000,000

Merger Sub is a party or is otherwise bound. There are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of the Parent Common Stock or other
capital stock of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of each of Merger Sub is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by Parent or
a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of any
lien, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance. Except as set forth

and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and to consummate,
subject only to approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Parent Common Stock of the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 4 hereof (the "Parent Requisite Vote"), the Merger and the transactions
                       ---------------------
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company, is a valid and legally binding agreement of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in

and registered or exempt from registration under any applicable state securities
or "blue sky" laws.

          (b)  The Board of Directors of each of the Parent and the Merger Sub
has approved this Agreement and adopted the Plan set forth in this Agreement.
The Board of Directors of Parent has received the opinion of its financial
advisors, Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, to the effect
that the Merger Consideration to be issued by Parent is fair, from a financial
point of view, to Parent.

     6.6. Governmental Filings; No Violations.
          -----------------------------------

                                       24
<PAGE>

               (a)  Except with respect to Environmental Laws, which are
specifically addressed in Section 6.13, other than the filings and/or notices
(A) pursuant to Section 1.3, (B) under the HSR Act, the Securities Act and the

or other filings are required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub with, nor are
any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be
obtained by Parent or Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity, in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and
the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

               (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute
or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, either the
articles of organization or bylaws of Parent, the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws of Merger Sub or the comparable governing instruments of any of
Parent's Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the
acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a lien, pledge, security
interest or other encumbrance on the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any Contracts
binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Law or governmental or
non-governmental permit, license, judgment, injunction, order, decree, statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any of
the Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) above, for any breach,
violation, default, acceleration, creation or change that would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

     6.7.      Parent Reports; Financial Statements.
               ------------------------------------

               Parent has made, or, as appropriate, will make, available to the
Company each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information
statement filed by it since December 31, 1999 (the "Parent Audit Date") and
                                                    -----------------
prior to the Effective Time, including (i) Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, (ii) Parent's Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2000 and June 30, 2000,
(iii) Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 28, 2000, (iv) Registration Statement
on Form S-8 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2000, and (v) Registration
Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on April 10, 2000 and amendments
thereto, each in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments
thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, including amendments of any such
reports as amended, the "Parent Reports").  The Parent Reports (i) were or will
                         --------------
be filed on a timely basis, (ii) were or will be prepared in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable to such Parent Reports, and (iii) did not or will not at
the time they were or are filed contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in such Parent Reports or
necessary in order to make the statements in such Parent Reports, in the

                                       25
<PAGE>

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
Subsidiary of the Parent is required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly presents the consolidated financial position of Parent and
its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
income and of changes in financial positions included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly presents the consolidated results of operations and cash flows, as the
case may be, of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and
normal year-end audit adjustments, which will not be material), in each case in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as
may be noted therein.

     6.8.  Absence of Certain Changes.
           --------------------------

           Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports or as set forth on Section
6.8 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, since the Parent Audit Date and through the
date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole have conducted their
business only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than
according to, the ordinary and usual course of such business and there has not
been (i) any change in the financial condition, properties, business, results of
operations or prospects of Parent and its Subsidiaries that has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any material
damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to any material asset or
material property owned, leased or otherwise used by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, not covered by insurance; (iii) any change by Parent in accounting
principles, practices or methods which is not required or permitted by GAAP; or
(iv) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution in respect of the capital stock of Parent, except for dividends or
other distributions on its capital stock publicly announced prior to the date
hereof or in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

     6.9.  Litigation.
           ----------

           Except with respect to Environmental Laws, which are specifically
addressed in Section 6.13, and except as disclosed in the Parent Reports, there
are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings,
investigations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the executive
officers of the Parent, threatened against or affecting the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for those that would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or materially burden or materially impair the ability of the
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, nor any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or rules of any
Governmental Entity pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of
the Parent, threatened against or affecting the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for those that would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or materially burden or materially impair the ability of the
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. There are no judgments, orders or decrees outstanding against the
Parent which, individually or in the aggregate, have had or are reasonably
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                                       26
<PAGE>

   6.10.  Compliance with Laws.
          --------------------

          The business of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole is not
being conducted in violation of any Laws, except for violations that would not
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially burden or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the
knowledge of the executive officers of Parent, threatened, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for those
the outcome of which would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent
or materially burden or materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and its Subsidiaries
each has all Permits from Governmental Entities necessary to conduct its
business as presently conducted, except for those the absence of which would not
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially burden or
materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Permits, except where the
failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No Permit will cease to be effective
as a result of the consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except where the cessation of effectiveness, individually or in the aggregate,
will not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

   6.11.  Required Vote.
          -------------

          The Parent shareholders approval, being the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Parent Common Stock entitled to vote, is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the securities of Parent necessary to approve
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

   6.12.  No Owned Real Properties.
          -------------------------
          Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports, the Parent and its
Subsidiaries do not own any real property.

                                       27
<PAGE>

   6.13.  Environmental Matters.
          ---------------------

          Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports and except for such matters
that would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent and its
Subsidiaries: (i) are in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii)
have not received any notice from any Governmental Entity or any third party
alleging any violation of, or liability under, any applicable Environmental
Laws; (iii) are not subject to any court order, administrative order or decree
arising under any Environmental Law; (iv) to the knowledge of the executive
officers of Parent do not own or operate any property that has been contaminated
with any Hazardous Substance; and (v) are not subject to any claims, demands or
notifications concerning liability for any Hazardous Substance disposal or
contamination.

   6.14.  Accounting and Tax Qualification Matters.
          ----------------------------------------

          As of or prior to the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor do the executive officers
of Parent have any knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that would prevent
Parent from accounting for the business combination to be effected by the Merger
as a "pooling-of-interests" or prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It is the
present plan and intention of Parent to (a) cause the Company to continue at
least one significant historic business line, or to use a significant portion of
the Company's historic business assets in a business, in each case within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.368-1(d) promulgated under the Internal Revenue
Code and (b) maintain the Company as a separate subsidiary which is directly
owned by the Parent and not to liquidate the Company or merge the Company with
any other entity; provided, however, Parent may cause the Company to be merged
into Parent.

   6.15.  Taxes.
          -----

          Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (i) have duly and timely filed
(taking into account any extension of time within which to file) all Tax Returns
required to be filed by any of them and all such filed Tax Returns are complete
and accurate in all respects, (ii) have paid all Taxes owed by the Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) that are shown
as due on such filed Tax Returns or that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are
obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third
party, except with respect to matters contested in good faith, and (iii) have
not waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, except, in
each case, for those failures to file or pay or those waivers that would not
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there are not
pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of Parent, threatened in
writing, any audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in
respect of Taxes or Tax matters.

   6.16.  Labor Matters.
          -------------

          Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor

                                       28
<PAGE>

union or labor organization. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is the
subject of any proceeding asserting that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
committed an unfair labor practice nor is there pending or, to the knowledge of
the executive officers of Parent, threatened, nor since January 1, 1998 has
there been any labor strike, dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, slow-down or
lockout involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that would
not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially burden or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

   6.17.  Intellectual Property.
          ---------------------

          (a)  Parent and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed or otherwise possesses valid rights to use, all patents, trademarks,
trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, and any applications
therefor, technology, know-how, computer software programs or applications, and
tangible or intangible proprietary information or materials that are used in the
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as conducted as of the date hereof,
except for any such failures to own, be licensed or possess that would not have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and to the knowledge of the executive officers
of Parent all patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks and copyrights
owned by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting, except for
those the invalidity of which would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (b)  Except as disclosed in Parent Reports or except as would not have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

                         (i)  Parent is not, nor will it be as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance of its obligations
hereunder, in violation of any licenses, sublicenses and other agreements as to
which Parent is a party as of the date hereof and pursuant to which Parent is
authorized to use any third-party patents, trademarks, service marks, domain
names, copyrights, trade secrets or computer software (collectively, "Parent
                                                                      ------
Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights");
----------------------------------------

                         (ii) no claims with respect to (a) the patents,
registered and material unregistered trademarks and service marks, domain names,
registered copyrights, trade names, and any applications therefor, trade secrets
or computer software owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Parent Intellectual Property Rights") or (b) Parent Third-Party
     -----------------------------------
Intellectual Property Rights are currently pending or, to the knowledge of the
executive officers of Parent, are threatened by any Person;

                         (iii)  to the knowledge of the executive officers of
Parent there are not any valid grounds for any bona fide claims (a) to the
effect that the sale, licensing or use of any product or service as used, sold
or licensed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, infringes on any copyright,
patent, trademark, service mark, domain names or trade secret; (b) against the
use by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any Parent Intellectual Property
Rights or Parent Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights used in the business
of Parent or any of its

                                       29
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries as currently conducted ; (c) challenging the ownership, validity or
enforceability of any of the Parent Intellectual Property Rights; or (d)
challenging the license or legally enforceable right to use of the Parent Third-
Party Intellectual Rights by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; and

                         (iv) to the knowledge of the executive officers of
Parent, there is no unauthorized use, infringement or misappropriation of any of
the material Parent Intellectual Property Rights by any third party, including
any employee or former employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

                         (v)  The Parent and its Subsidiaries have taken
reasonable measures to protect the proprietary nature of the Parent Intellectual
Property Rights that are material to the business of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and to maintain in confidence all trade secrets
and confidential information owned or used by the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries and that are material to the business of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

     6.18.  Brokers and Finders.
            -------------------

            Except for Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, neither Parent
nor any of its Affiliates, officers, directors or employees has employed any
broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions
or finders' fees in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of
Merrill Lynch and Company. Section 6.18 of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets
forth the estimated fees and expenses of Merrill Lynch and Company incurred and
to be incurred by the Parent and any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     6.19.  Board Recommendation.
            --------------------

            The Parent Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has by a
unanimous vote, (i) determined and declared that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable and fair
to and in the best interests of Parent and the shareholders of Parent and (ii)
resolved to recommend that the holders of Parent Common Stock approve the
issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. John R. Bertucci, Claire
R. Bertucci and certain Bertucci family trusts, simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, have executed the Parent Stockholder Agreement, in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-2 (the "Parent Stockholder Agreement"),
                                              ----------------------------
agreeing to vote all shares of Parent Common Stock owned by them in favor of the

are owned free and clear of all

                                       30
<PAGE>

Liens except for (i) Liens which are disclosed in the Parent Reports filed prior
to the date of this Agreement and (ii) other Liens which, individually and in
the aggregate, do not materially interfere with the ability of the Parent and
its Subsidiaries to conduct their business as currently conducted and as
presently proposed to be conducted and have not resulted in, and are not
reasonably likely to result in, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The tangible
assets of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are free from
material defects, have been maintained in accordance with normal industry
practice, are in good operating condition and repair (subject to normal wear and
tear) and are suitable for the purpose for which they are presently used.

     6.21.  Customers and Suppliers.
            -----------------------

            No customer of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that
represented 5% or more of the Parent's consolidated revenues in the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1999 has indicated to the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that it will stop, or decrease the rate of, buying materials, products or
services from the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. No supplier of the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries has indicated to the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that it will stop, or decrease the rate of, supplying materials,
products or services to them, which cessation or decrease, individually or in
the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     6.22.  Business Activity Restrictions.
            ------------------------------

            There is no non-competition or other similar agreement, commitment,
judgment, injunction or order to which the Parent or any Subsidiary of the
Parent is a party or subject to that has or could reasonably be expected to have
the effect of prohibiting or impairing the conduct of the business by the Parent
in any material respect. The Parent has not entered into any agreement under
which it is restricted in any material respect from selling, licensing or
otherwise distributing any of its technology or products, or providing services
to, customers or potential customers or any class of customers, in any
geographic area, during any period of time or any segment of the market or line
of business.

     6.23.  Disclosure.
            ----------

            No representation or warranty by Parent and/or Merger Sub in this
Agreement, nor any statement, certificate, schedule, document or exhibit hereto
furnished or to be furnished by or on behalf of Parent and/or Merger Sub
pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with transactions contemplated
hereby, contains or shall contain any untrue statement of material fact or omits
or shall omit a material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein
or therein not misleading.

     6.24.  No Other Representations or Warranties
            --------------------------------------

            Except for the representations and warranties contained in this
Section 6, neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any other Person makes any other
express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates.

Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, employee, financial advisor, representative or

constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a proposal or offer for
a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantial assets,
tender offer, sale of shares of capital stock (excluding sales pursuant to
existing Compensation and Benefit Plans) or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by

                      --------------------
discussions concerning, or provide any information to any person or entity
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (z) agree to or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that, if the Company has not breached
this Section 7.2, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company
or its Board of Directors, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company, from:

                         (i)  furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity in connection with an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such person or entity or
recommending an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the
shareholders of the Company, if and only to the extent that:

                    (A)  the Board of Directors of the Company believes in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition
Proposal is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed and
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable than the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such more favorable Acquisition
Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal") and the
                                                   -----------------
Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel that such action is necessary for such Board of Directors
to fulfill its fiduciary duties,

                    (B)  prior to furnishing such non-public information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity, such
Board of Directors receives from such person or entity an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to such party than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and

                                       35
<PAGE>

                    (C)  prior to recommending a Superior Proposal or
     terminating this Agreement in respect thereof, the Company shall provide
     the Parent with at least five business days' notice of its proposal to do
     so, during which time the Parent may make, and in such event the Company
     shall consider, a counterproposal to such Superior Proposal; or

                         (ii)  complying with Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors, shall, except as
permitted by paragraph (i) of this section, propose to approve or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal.

          (b)  The Company will immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore of
the nature described in Section 7.2(a) and will use reasonable efforts to obtain
the return of any confidential information furnished to any such parties.

          (c)  The Company shall notify the Parent immediately (but in any
event, within one (1) business day) after receipt by the Company (or its
advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and
in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identify of the offer and
the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact. The Company shall
continue to keep the Parent promptly informed of any change in the status of any
such discussions or negotiations and the terms being discussed or negotiated

          (d)  Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall (i) permit the Company to
terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Section 9.3
hereof), or (ii) permit the Company to enter into any agreement with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement of the type referred to in Section 7.2(a) above).

          (e)  Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2 by any director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.2 by
the Company.

          --------------------

          (a)  The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

          (c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do

amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law, or, regulation or decree
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), to
respond as promptly as practicable to any government requests for information
under any Antitrust Law and to contest and resist any action, including any
legislative, administrative or judicial action and to have vacated, lifted,

prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Each of the Company and

views of one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection
with any legal proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or any other foreign,
federal or state antitrust or fair trade Laws. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any

proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in

contrary in this Agreement, neither the Company, the Parent nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to (x) divest any of their respective
businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or agree to take any other
action or agree to any limitation, that could reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or (y) take any action under this Section if the
United States Department of Justice or the United States Federal Trade
Commission

                                       39
<PAGE>

enjoin consummation of the Merger.

     7.6. Accounting.
          ----------

          Both Parent and the Company agree not to knowingly take or cause to be
taken any action, whether before or after the Effective Time, that would
disqualify the Merger as a "pooling of interests" for accounting purposes

     7.7. Access.
          ------

          (a) Stock Options.
              -------------

                         (i)     Each Company Option under the Company Stock
Plans shall, at the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the Company
Stock Plans pursuant to which such Company Options were issued, be deemed to
constitute options to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to
the nearest whole number) obtained by multiplying (x) the number equal to the
number of Shares the holder of each such Company Option would have been entitled
to receive immediately prior to the Effective Time had such holder exercised
such Company Option in full (assuming for such purposes that such Company Option
was fully exercisable at such time) immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(y) the Exchange Ratio,

                                       41

purchasable pursuant to each such Company Option (assuming for such purposes

agreement by which it is evidenced. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company
Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8, or, if unavailable, a registration statement
on Form S-3 (or any successor forms), or another appropriate form with respect
to the Parent Common Stock subject to Company Options, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become
and remain effective (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein), as well as comply with any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as any Company Options remain

                   (iii)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.12 and Section 9.6, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all

                                       42
<PAGE>

costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense.

    7.13. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.
          ---------------------------------------------------

          (a) The Certificate shall contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification set forth in Article VII of the bylaws of the Company on the
date of this Agreement and shall provide for indemnification to the fullest
extent permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the
Effective Time (or, in the case of matters known prior to the Effective Time
which have not been resolved prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, until such matters are finally resolved) in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to
the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company in respect of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

          (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (and Parent shall
also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law), each present and former director and officer of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or
                                     -------------------
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages
or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") reasonably incurred in connection with
                               -----
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (b) of this Section 7.13, upon receiving written notification of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify
Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any
liability it may have to such Indemnified Party to the extent that such failure
does not prejudice Parent. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) Parent shall have the right within ten (10) days following the
notification of Parent by the Indemnified Person of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation to assume the defense thereof (with counsel of its
selection, which may be regular corporate counsel to Parent) and Parent shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other
counsel subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense, or
representation of the Indemnified Parties by counsel selected by Parent would
pose a conflict of interest, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Parent shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties. If such indemnity is not available
with respect to any Indemnified Party, then Parent and the Indemnified Party
shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative faults and benefits of the Surviving Corporation (in the
case of Parent) and the Indemnified Parties. No settlements shall be made on
behalf of an Indemnified Party without such Indemnified Party's consent unless

                                       43
<PAGE>

such settlement provide for a full release of such Indemnified Party. No
Indemnified Party may enter into any settlement without the prior written
consent of the Parent.

          (d) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Company's existing
officers' and directors' liability insurance ("D&O Insurance") for a period of
                                               -------------
six years after the Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not
in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof (the
"Current Premium"); provided, however, that if the existing D&O Insurance is
 ---------------
terminated or cancelled during such six-year period, the Surviving Corporation
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as much D&O Insurance as can
be obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess (on an
annualized basis) of 200% of the Current Premium and shall agree to indemnify
the directors and officers for any Costs not covered by such D&O Insurance.

          (e) The provisions of this Section are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their representatives and shall be in addition to any other rights to
indemnification (e.g. any assumed indemnification obligations).

   7.14.  Takeover Statute.
          ----------------

          If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company and their respective Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effect's of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

   7.15.  Parent Vote.
          -----------

          Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to be voted
(or a consent to be given with respect to) any Shares and any shares of common
stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it or any of its Affiliates or with
respect to which it or any of its Affiliates has the power (by agreement, proxy
or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide a consent), in favor of the
approval of this Agreement at the Shareholders' Meeting or any other meeting of
stockholders of the Company or Merger Sub, respectively, at which this Agreement
shall be submitted for approval and at all adjournments or postponements thereof
(or, if applicable, by any action of stockholders of either the Company or
Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a meeting).

   7.16.  "Pooling of Interests" Letters.
          -------------------------------

          Each of Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from their respective independent accountants the
"pooling of interests" letters described in Section 8.1(h).

   7.17.  Offers of Employment.
          --------------------

                                       44
<PAGE>

          At the Effective Time, the Parent or Surviving Corporation shall offer
to employ all employees of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time on terms and conditions that are substantially the same as their terms and
conditions immediately prior to the Effective Time.  Parent will give credit for
past services of such employees with the Company or its Affiliates for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and benefits levels to the extent permitted under the
Parent's employee benefits plans.  The employees of the Company will be provided
with benefits under employee benefit plans that are not materially less
favorable in the aggregate than the Plans provided by the Parent to its
employees.

   7.18.  Stockholder Litigation.
          ----------------------

          Until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms or the Effective Time, the Company shall give the Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company or its Board of Directors relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall
not settle any such litigation without the Parent's prior written consent, which
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
