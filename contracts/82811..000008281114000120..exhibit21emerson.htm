Section 2.06. Limitation on Assignment of Purchased Assets. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute
an agreement to assign any Purchased Asset or any right thereunder if an
attempted assignment, without the consent of, or other action by, any third

rights of Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates thereunder. If
such consent is not obtained or such other action is not taken, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer
would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance
with this Agreement.

Section 2.07. Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price. Â¤ The purchase
price for the Purchased Assets and the Shares (the "Purchase Price") is one
billion and four hundred million dollars ($1,400,000,000) in cash (the

Value Adjustment minus the Audit Purchase Price Adjustment. The Purchase Price

Section 2.13(c)) and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section
2.10 and Section 2.12.

(a) At the Closing, if and only if a Deferred Closing is required with respect

the terms of this Agreement and the U.S. Escrow Agreement and the China Escrow
Agreement, respectively.

(b) The Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Purchased Assets and the
Shares as set forth in the statement attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "Master
Allocation Statement"), which shall include a specific allocation with respect
to each Deferred Business.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but not later than 180 days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver â¢ a statement allocating the
"aggregate deemed sales price" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338-4) with respect to each Section 338(h)(10)
Subsidiary in accordance with the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 338(h)(10) (the "338(h)(10) Allocation Statement") and â¢ a statement
allocating the Purchase Price with respect to the Purchased Assets (plus any
Assumed Liabilities and capitalized costs taken into account under Section
1060 of the Code) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code (the "1060 Allocation Statement") (the Master Allocation
Statement, the 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement, and the 1060 Allocation
Statement, collectively, the "Allocation Statements"). The 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statement and the 1060 Allocation Statement shall be consistent
with the allocation of the Purchase Price to the Shares and the Purchased
Assets in the Master Allocation Statement. If, within 20 days after the
delivery of the 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement and the 1060 Allocation
Statement, Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller objects to any
allocation set forth thereon, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve such objection. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve such dispute within 20 days following Seller's notification of such
objection, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain an Accounting Referee (as
defined in Section 2.11(c) below) to resolve the disputed items. Upon
resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statement and/or the 1060 Allocation Statement, as applicable,
shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of
the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

(d) If an adjustment is made with respect to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.10, Section 2.12 or otherwise, any adjustment shall be allocated to

nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waiver of those conditions) have
been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waived) (the
date on which such conditions are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, waived), the "Closing Trigger Date"); provided that, (x) if
there are less than two Business Days remaining in the calendar month when the
Closing Trigger Date occurs, the Closing shall occur on the last Business Day
in the immediately succeeding month, so long as all of the conditions set
forth in Article 10 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, waiver of those conditions) are satisfied (or, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waived) on such date and (y) Seller
may, in its sole discretion, elect to have the Closing occur on a date other
than the last Business Day of the month, in which case, the Closing will occur
as soon as possible, but in no event later than five Business Days after the
Closing Trigger Date. The Closing, or any Deferred Closing to the extent
applicable, shall be deemed effective as of 11:59:59 p.m. on the Closing Date,

endorsed or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank, with any
required transfer stamps affixed thereto and accompanied by the applicable
Foreign Transfer Agreement and such instruments that Seller and Buyer agree
are reasonably necessary to validly transfer such Foreign Subsidiary Share to

Section 2.09. Foreign Transfer Agreements. The transfer of each Purchased
Foreign Subsidiary and the assignment of the Purchased Assets and assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities relating to any portion of the Business located
outside of the United States will, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
be effected pursuant to individual short-form acquisition agreements (each a
"Foreign Transfer Agreement") on a country-by-country basis in substantially
the form attached as Exhibit G to this Agreement; provided that, in each case,
the Foreign Transfer Agreements shall serve purely to effect the legal
transfer of the applicable Purchased Foreign Subsidiary or the assignment of
such Purchased Assets and assumption of such Assumed Liabilities. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) the Foreign Transfer Agreements shall not have any
effect on the value being given or received by Seller or Buyer, including the
allocation of assets and Liabilities as between them, all of which shall be
determined solely in accordance with this Agreement (ii) the Foreign Transfer
Agreements shall not have any effect on any of the rights of the parties set
forth this Agreement and (iii) in the event of any conflicts between any
Foreign Transfer Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
shall control in all respects. Seller and Buyer shall not, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates not to, bring any claim for any cause of action
under any Foreign Transfer Agreement.

Section 2.10. Audit Adjustment; Dispute Resolution. (b) Following delivery of
the Audited Financial Statements, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
(subject to Section 2.10(c)) (the "Audit Purchase Price Adjustment") as
follows:

(i) if (A) Final PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA is equal to or exceeds PTS
Unaudited Adjusted EBITDA or (B) PTS Unaudited Adjusted EBITDA exceeds Final
PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA by $2,000,000 or less, the Audit Purchase Price
Adjustment shall be zero; and

(ii) if PTS Unaudited Adjusted EBITDA exceeds Final PTS Audited Adjusted
EBITDA by more than $2,000,000, the Audit Purchase Price Adjustment shall be
an amount equal to (A) 11.71 multiplied by (B) PTS Unaudited Adjusted EBITDA
minus Final PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA minus $2,000,000.

(c) The Audit Purchase Price Adjustment shall be determined as follows:

(i) Seller shall promptly, and in any event, within three Business Days after
receipt of the Audited Financial Statements from KPMG, deliver to Buyer such
Audited Financial Statements together with a statement (the "EBITDA
Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Seller's calculation of PTS
Audited Adjusted EBITDA (such amount, the "Initial PTS Audited Adjusted
EBITDA"), and (subject to Buyer executing and delivering to KPMG a customary
indemnity letter in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to KPMG) shall
permit Buyer to review the work papers related to the Audited Financial
Statements as promptly as practicable after the receipt of the Audited
Financial Statements.

(ii) If Buyer disagrees with Seller's calculation of PTS Audited Adjusted
EBITDA as set forth in the EBITDA Statement, Buyer may, within ten days after
the later of the delivery of such statement and the date Buyer is first
permitted to review the work papers related to the Audited Financial
Statements deliver a written notice to Seller (an "EBITDA Dispute Notice')
disagreeing with such calculation and which specifies Buyer's calculation of
PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA in reasonable detail, including specifying Buyer's
grounds for each point of disagreement (each, an "EBITDA Disputed Item").
Buyer may deliver only one EBITDA Dispute Notice.

(iii) If Buyer duly delivers an EBITDA Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller shall,
during the 15 days following such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts
to reach agreement on each EBITDA Disputed Item in order to determine the
Final PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach
such agreement during such period, they shall promptly thereafter appoint the
Accounting Referee and cause such Accounting Referee to promptly review this
Agreement and each EBITDA Disputed Item for purposes of determining Final PTS
Audited Adjusted EBITDA. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee
shall consider only the EBITDA Disputed Items. The Accounting Referee shall
deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a written report
setting forth such calculation. The cost of such review and report shall be
borne (i) by Seller if (A) the difference between Final PTS Audited Adjusted
EBITDA and Initial PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA is greater than (B) the
difference between Final PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA and PTS Audited Adjusted
EBITDA as set forth in the EBITDA Dispute Notice, (ii) by Buyer if the amount
described in clause (B) above is greater than the amount described in clause
(A) and (iii) otherwise equally between Buyer and Seller. For purposes of this
Section 2.10, "Final PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA" means (i) PTS Audited
Adjusted EBITDA as set forth in the EBITDA Statement if Buyer does not duly
deliver an EBITDA Dispute Notice or (ii) if Buyer duly delivers an EBITDA
Dispute Notice, (x) PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA as mutually agreed by Buyer
and Seller or (y) otherwise, PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA as determined by the
Accounting Referee; provided that, in no event will Final PTS Audited Adjusted
EBITDA be more than Seller's calculation thereof as set forth in the EBITDA
Statement or less than Buyer's calculation thereof as set forth in the EBITDA
Dispute Notice.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.10, under no
circumstances shall the Closing be conditioned upon, or delayed by, the
determination of Final PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA pursuant to this Section
2.10. If the Closing Trigger Date has occurred, but Final PTS Audited Adjusted
EBITDA has not been determined in accordance with this Section 2.10, at
Closing the Audit Purchase Price Adjustment shall be determined using Initial
PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA and, within five Business Days after the
determination of Final PTS Audited Adjusted EBITDA pursuant to Section 2.10(b)
(but in no event before the Closing Date):

(i) if the Audit Purchase Price Adjustment determined using Final PTS Audited
Adjusted EBITDA exceeds the Audit Purchase Price Adjustment determined at
Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such difference plus interest
thereon from the Closing at the rate set forth in Section 2.15 by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer; and

(ii) if the Audit Purchase Price Adjustment determined using Final PTS Audited
Adjusted EBITDA is less than the Audit Purchase Price Adjustment determined at
Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such difference plus interest
thereon from the Closing at the rate set forth in Section 2.15 by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller.

Section 2.11. Final Purchase Price Calculation. Â¤ As promptly as practicable,
but no later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller will cause to be
prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting
forth Seller's calculation of (i) Adjusted Base Modified Net Asset Value,
Modified Net Asset Value and the Modified Net Asset Value Adjustment based
thereon, (ii) Closing Cash and (iii) the Purchase Price based thereon.

(a) If Buyer disagrees with Seller's calculation of the Purchase Price as set
forth in the Closing Statement, Buyer may, within 30 days after delivery of
the Closing Statement, deliver a written notice to Seller (a "Dispute Notice")
disagreeing with such calculation and which specifies Buyer's calculation of
Adjusted Base Modified Net Asset Value, Modified Net Asset Value and the
Modified Net Asset Value Adjustment based thereon, Closing Cash and the
Purchase Price based thereon, in each case, in reasonable detail, including
specifying Buyer's grounds for each point of disagreement. Buyer may deliver
only one Dispute Notice. The Dispute Notice shall specify those items or
amounts as to which Buyer disagrees (each, a "Disputed Item"), and Buyer shall
be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Closing Statement.

(b) If Buyer duly delivers a Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller shall, during
the 30 days following such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to
reach agreement on each Disputed Item in order to determine the Purchase
Price. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement during such
period, they shall promptly thereafter jointly retain a nationally recognized
accounting firm, who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer or
Seller (the "Accounting Referee") and cause such Accounting Referee promptly
to review this Agreement and the Disputed Items for the purpose of calculating
the Purchase Price. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall
consider only the Disputed Items. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to
Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a written report setting forth
such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and
Seller. The cost of such review and report shall be borne (i) by Seller if
Seller is awarded less than 50% of the sum of all Disputed Items submitted to
the Accounting Referee, (ii) by Buyer if Buyer is awarded less than 50% of the
sum of all Disputed Items submitted to the Accounting Referee and (iii)
otherwise equally by Buyer and Seller.

(c) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective
independent accountants and Subsidiaries to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Purchase Price
and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 2.11, including
the making available to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers
and personnel.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, neither the calculations to be made pursuant
to this Section 2.11, nor the purchase price adjustment to be made pursuant to
Section 2.12 are intended to be used to adjust for errors or omissions that
may be found with respect to the Balance Sheet or the Base Modified Net Asset
Value, for which Article 11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy. No fact or
event, including any market or business development, occurring on or after the
Effective Time of the Closing, and no change in GAAP or Applicable Law after
the date hereof, shall be taken into consideration in the calculations to be
made pursuant to Section 2.11. It is understood that (i) the Illustrative
Modified Net Asset Value Statement set forth in Schedule II is attached only
for the purposes set forth in the definition of "Modified Net Asset Value" and
(ii) the Base Modified Net Asset Value is a negotiated number derived
independently of the Illustrative Modified Net Asset Value Statement.

Section 2.12. Adjustment of Purchase Price. Â¤ If the Final Purchase Price
exceeds the Closing Cash Consideration, Buyer shall pay to Seller, in the
manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.12(b), the amount of such
excess. If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Closing Cash
Consideration, Seller shall pay to Buyer, in the manner and with interest as
provided in Section 2.12(b), the amount of such difference. The "Final
Purchase Price" means the Purchase Price (x) as set forth in the Closing
Statement if Buyer does not duly deliver a Dispute Notice or (y) if a Dispute
Notice is delivered (A) as agreed between Seller and Buyer pursuant to Section
2.11(c) or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as determined by the
Accounting Referee pursuant to Section 2.11(c); provided that in no event
shall (I) Adjusted Base Modified Net Asset Value be less than Seller's
calculation thereof or more than Buyer's calculation thereof, (II) Modified
Net Asset Value be more than Seller's calculation thereof or less than Buyer's
calculation thereof or (III) Closing Cash be more than Seller's calculation
thereof or less than Buyer's calculation thereof, in each case, as set forth
in the Closing Statement and the Dispute Notice, respectively.

(a) Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be made by Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, at a mutually convenient time within five Business
Days after the determination of the Final Purchase Price, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account or accounts of such other party as
may be designated by such other party.

Section 2.13. Deferred Closing; Philippine Escrow. Â¤ As of the Closing, if,
and only if, any of the actions specified in Section 2.13 of the Disclosure
Schedule with respect to the assignment and assumption of the Purchased Assets
and Assumed Liabilities of Emerson Slovakia, Emerson Electric Brazil or
Emerson India or the purchase and sale of the shares of capital stock of EPT

Business, Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver a joint written

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if â¢, on the
four-month anniversary of the Closing Date, any amount with respect to the
Slovakia Consideration, the Brazil Consideration or the China Consideration
remains on deposit in the U.S. Escrow Account or â¢ on the six-month

was due to but excluding the date of payment. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not be required to pay interest on the
applicable portion of any Remaining Escrowed Funds as set forth in this
Section 2.13(e) if the failure to consummate the related Deferred Closing

or any other Transaction Document to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a
party.

intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has given Buyer complete and
open access to the key employees, documents and facilities of the Business.
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Purchased Assets and the Shares are
sold "as is" and Buyer agrees to accept the Purchased Assets and the Business
in the condition they are in on the Closing Date based on its own inspection,
examination and determination with respect to all matters, and without
reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of any
nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller, except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or warranty with
respect to (i) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made
available to Buyer or its Representatives of future revenues, future results
of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Business or the future
business and operations of the Business or (ii) except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, any other information or documents made available to Buyer
or its Representatives with respect to the Business.

investment in the Shares and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such
investment.

(bb) pay, discharge, settle or satisfy any Liability which if not so
discharged, settled or satisfied, would be an Assumed Liability, other than

Purchased Subsidiary to incur Indebtedness for borrowed money from another

after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, without Buyer's consent,
disclose to any third party (other than each other and their respective

Subsidiary, relating to the Business or otherwise included in the Purchased
Assets or any information disclosed to Seller pursuant to the exercise of its
rights under Section 7.09 hereof (collectively, the "Confidential
Information"); provided that the foregoing restriction shall not Â¤ apply to
any information (i) generally available to, or known by, the public (other
than as a result of disclosure in violation of this Section 5.02) or (ii)
independently developed by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than by the
Business prior to the Closing), or Â¤ prohibit any disclosure (i) required by
Applicable Law so long as, to the extent legally permissible, Seller provides
Buyer with reasonable prior notice of such disclosure and a reasonable
opportunity to contest such disclosure or (ii) made in connection with the
enforcement of any right or remedy under the Transaction Documents.

Section 5.03. Noncompetition. Â¤ As an inducement to cause Buyer to enter into
this Agreement, Seller agrees that during the 36-month period commencing on
the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall engage, directly or indirectly, in any business that
competes with the Business anywhere in the world as it exists on the Closing
Date (a "Competing Business"); provided that nothing herein shall prohibit (x)
the acquisition by Seller or any of its Affiliates of a diversified business
having not more than 20% of its sales (based on its latest annual financial
statements) attributable to any Competing Business, (y) the acquisition by
Seller or any of its Affiliates of a diversified business having more than 20%
of its sales (based on its latest annual financial statements) attributable to
any Competing Business; provided that Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to divest such Competing Business or a portion thereof so that the
Competing Business represents not more than 20% of such diversified business's
sales (based on its latest annual financial statements), within 12 months
following consummation of such acquisition or (z) the acquisition, holding of
investments or direct or indirect ownership by Seller or any of its Affiliates
of any voting stock, capital stock or other equity interest of any Person
engaged in a Competing Business, so long as such ownership interest represents
not more than 20% of the aggregate voting power or outstanding capital stock
or other equity interests of such Person. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the design, manufacture, sale and/or
servicing of any products sold or in production in a line of business other
than the Business (as conducted, or as contemplated to be conducted, on the
Closing Date) by Seller or any of its Affiliates shall not be considered a
Competing Business and (B) the foregoing shall not, in any way, limit or
effect Seller's ability to operate a Deferred Business in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or perform its obligations under the Transition
Services Agreement.

(b) Seller acknowledges that: (i) Seller's obligations under this Section 5.03
are reasonable in the context of the nature of the Business and the
competitive injuries likely to be sustained by the Business and Buyer if
Seller or any of its Affiliates were to violate such obligations; (ii) the
covenants in this Section 5.03 are adequately supported by consideration from
Buyer for the benefit of Seller and (iii) the foregoing makes it necessary for
the protection of the Business and Buyer that Seller uphold Seller's
obligations under this Section 5.03 for the reasonable time period contained
herein. If any provision in this Section 5.03 shall for any reason be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section
5.03, but this Section 5.03 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein
is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not
permitted by Applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any
extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of
no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable
under Applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and
interpret or reform this Section 5.03 to provide for a covenant having the
maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not
greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under
such Applicable Law.

Section 5.04. Termination of Intercompany Arrangements. On or prior to
Closing, Seller shall take any and all actions necessary to (a) terminate any
contract between a Purchased Subsidiary and Seller or any Retained Subsidiary
except for the Existing China Intercompany Loan and the contracts set forth in
Section 5.04 of the Disclosure Schedules and (b) repay any indebtedness owed
by a Purchased Subsidiary to Seller or any Retained Subsidiary, in each case
without any Liability of any Purchased Subsidiary or the Business thereafter;
provided that, (x) if a Deferred Closing will occur with respect to EPT China,
the foregoing obligation with respect to any contract with EPT China must be
satisfied on or prior to the Deferred Closing and (y) the foregoing obligation
shall not apply with respect to any Transaction Document.

Section 5.05. Insurance.(f) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain or cause to be maintained in full force and effect all third-party
insurance coverage for product liability, product warranty or Recall matters
covering the Business or the Purchased Assets (or comparable replacement
coverage) until the Closing. Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer
any proceeds received following the Closing under such third-party insurance
policies for events occurring prior to the Closing and to the extent that
Buyer has suffered an actual loss in respect such event and such loss was not
taken into account in determining the final Modified Net Asset Value. For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing insurance
to the Business for any events actually occurring on or after the Closing
Date.

(g) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enable Buyer and its
Affiliates or the Business to file, notice and otherwise continue to pursue
any claims on behalf of any Purchased Subsidiary or the Business under any
third-party liability, property or casualty insurance policy for the Business
for events actually occurring prior to the Closing, and to enable Buyer and
its Affiliates or the Business to recover, on behalf of any Purchased
Subsidiary or the Business, proceeds under the terms of such third-party
policies (including recovery of such proceeds after the Closing, but only to
the extent such policies would otherwise permit such recovery by Seller).

instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document as violative of the HSR Act or any other

Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions
by or with respect to the Purchased Assets or Purchased Subsidiaries; by
consenting to such action), as may be required (x) by the applicable
Governmental Authority in order to resolve such objections as such
Governmental Authority may have to such transactions under the HSR Act or any
other applicable Competition Law or (y) by any domestic or foreign court or
other tribunal, in any Action challenging such transactions as violative of
the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law, in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or
reversal of, any order that has the effect of restricting, preventing or
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, none of Buyer and any of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall be
required to agree to any sale, transfer, license, separate holding,
divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition of or any

Section 7.02. Certain Filings. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one
another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and (ii) in
taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers in a timely manner. Buyer shall, subject to and
without limiting Buyer's obligations under Section 7.01(c) and the other
provisions of this Section 7.02, be permitted to implement its strategy and
otherwise pursue its position as to which it has (x) previously discussed and
consulted with Seller, (y) taken the Seller's views into account in good faith
and (z) developed, implemented and pursued with a view to obtaining any
necessary clearances pursuant to Competition Laws as promptly as practicable
(and in any event by the End Date) and Seller agrees it shall not take a
position in any filing, meeting or communication with any Governmental
Authority that is contrary to or inconsistent with such strategy and position.
Buyer shall be permitted to take the lead in all joint meetings and
communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining
any necessary clearances pursuant to Competition Laws; provided, that Buyer
shall have complied with the other provisions of this Section 7.02.

only following consultation with the other party to the extent practicable,
issue such public disclosure as may be required by Applicable Law or any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange to which the
disclosing party is subject.

Section 7.04. Notices of Certain Events. Â¤ Each of Seller and Buyer shall
promptly notify the other party of:

obtain such consent would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect;

(ii) any material notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by any Transaction
Documents; and

(iii) the commencement of any Action that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to, in the case
of Seller, Section 3.09 (unless such Action would constitute an Excluded
Liability) or, in the case of Buyer, Section 4.06.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a party's failure to
comply with this Section 7.04 shall not provide the other party hereto or any
of such other party's Affiliates with a right not to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.05. WARN Act. Buyer shall assume all Liabilities for the provision
of notice or payment in lieu of notice and any applicable penalties under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any similar Applicable
Law arising with respect to terminations of employment of Transferred

all Liabilities (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Liabilities of a
Purchased Subsidiary) for the provision of notice or payment in lieu of notice

with respect to terminations of employment of Business Employees prior to the
Applicable Transfer Time; provided that Buyer shall assume all such
Liabilities with respect to any Business Employee who does not receive an

Applicable Law in respect of the Business Employees.

Section 7.06. Non-solicit. Â¤ For a period of 24 months following the Closing
Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly
solicit (or cause to be directly solicited) for employment or hire any
officer, management employee or key technical employee of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries who is a Transferred Employee as of immediately following the
Applicable Transfer Time (any such employee, a "Covered Business Employee");
provided that (i) the foregoing restriction shall not apply to (A) generalized
searches for employees through media advertisements of general circulation,
employment search firms, open job fairs or other similar means which are not
specifically targeted at such Covered Business Employees or (B) any Covered
Business Employee whose employment is terminated by the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including any Purchased Subsidiary) and (ii) with respect to any
Covered Business Employee who voluntarily ceases employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates (including any Purchased Subsidiary), the foregoing restriction
shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (I) the date that is 24 months
following the Closing Date and (II) the date that is six months following the
cessation of such Covered Business Employee's employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates (including any Purchased Subsidiary).

(e) For a period of 24 months following the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Purchased
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly solicit (or cause to be directly
or indirectly solicited) for employment or hire (i) any person who is employed
by Seller or a Retained Subsidiary with a title of director, vice president or
higher, or (ii) any person who is employed by Seller or a Retained Subsidiary
whom Buyer, its Affiliates or any of its or their representatives has contact
with or has had contact with during its evaluation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement, and who is at the time of
such solicitation or was within the six months preceding such solicitation an
employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that (i) the foregoing
restriction shall not apply to (A) generalized searches for employees through
media advertisements of general circulation, employment search firms, open job
fairs or other similar means which are not specifically targeted at such
employees or (B) any such employee whose employment is terminated by Seller or
any of its Affiliates, (ii) with respect to any such employee who voluntarily
ceases employment with Seller or its Affiliates, the foregoing restriction
shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (A) the date that is 24 months
following the Closing Date and (B) the date that is six months following the
cessation of such employee's employment with Seller or its Affiliate and (iii)
in the case of employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries who provide services to
Buyer pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, the foregoing restriction

services of such employees are provided by Seller or its Affiliates pursuant
to the Transition Services Agreement.

Section 7.07. Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege. Â¤ Buyer waives and shall not assert, and agrees to
cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Purchased
Subsidiaries) to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out
of or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing
Representation"), of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any shareholder,
officer, employee or director of Seller or any of its Affiliates (any such
Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter involving this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
by any legal counsel currently representing Seller or any of its Affiliates,
including any Purchased Subsidiary, in connection with this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(the "Current Representation").

(d) Buyer waives and shall not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) to waive and to not
assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication
between any legal counsel and any Designated Person relating to the Current
Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including
in connection with a dispute with Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and
following the Closing, with any Purchased Subsidiary, it being the intention
of the parties hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege
and to control such attorney-client privilege under such circumstances shall
be retained by Seller; provided that the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement
of retention shall not extend to any communication not involving this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or to communications with any Person other than the
Designated Persons and their advisers.

(e) Seller and Buyer agree to take, and to cause their respective Affiliates
to take, all steps reasonably necessary to implement the intent of this
Section 7.07.

Section 7.08. Business/Non-Business Assets. Prior to the Closing, Seller and
the Purchased Subsidiaries shall effect all transfers and take all such
actions as are necessary so that any assets of the Purchased Subsidiaries not
used or held for use primarily in the Business or that would constitute
Excluded Assets under Section 2.03 if they were assets of a Retained
Subsidiary (the "Non-Business Assets") are transferred to Seller or a Retained
Subsidiary with no post-Closing cost or Liability to any Purchased Subsidiary
(other than any Liability reflected in the Modified Net Asset Value Adjustment
or for which Seller would have an indemnification obligation under Section
11.02(a) without any limitation thereunder). In the event that at any time, or
from time to time after the Closing Date, Seller on the one hand or Buyer on
the other (or any of their respective Affiliates, including the Purchased
Subsidiaries in the case of Buyer) shall receive or otherwise possess any
asset (including cash) that should belong to another Person pursuant to this
Agreement, such Person shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred,
such asset to the Person so entitled thereto. In furtherance of the foregoing,
(a) Buyer undertakes and agrees to return any Non-Business Assets and any
other assets that are not Purchased Assets that are owned by Seller or any of
its Affiliates and are transferred to Buyer at or after the Closing (through
failure to transfer such assets out of the Purchased Subsidiaries or
otherwise), and to forward or remit to Seller any payments received by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates on account of any Non-Business Asset, and (b) Seller
undertakes and agrees to transfer any Purchased Assets that are not
transferred to Buyer at or after the Closing, and to forward or remit to Buyer
any payments received by Seller or any of its Affiliates on account of any
Purchased Asset, including any accounts or notes receivable. Prior to any such
transfer, the Person receiving or possessing such asset shall hold such asset
in trust for such other Person.

Section 7.09. Access to Information; Cooperation. Â¤ From the date hereof until
the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement), and
subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, Seller will (i)
give Buyer, its counsel and other authorized Representatives reasonable access
to the properties, books and records of the Business, (ii) furnish to Buyer,
its counsel and other authorized Representatives such financial and operating
data and other information relating to the Business as such Persons may
reasonably request and (iii) instruct the employees, independent accountants,
counsel and financial advisors of Seller to cooperate with Buyer in its
investigation of the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and its
agents shall not have access (A) to any properties of Seller or its
Affiliates, including the Purchased Assets and the Real Property, for purposes
of conducting any sampling or other invasive investigation, including of the
air, soil, soil gas, surface water, groundwater, building materials or other
environmental media and (B) to any information to the extent primarily
relating to any Retained Business.

(g) From and after the Closing Date, and subject to Applicable Law, upon
request, Buyer will afford promptly to Seller and its authorized
Representatives reasonable access to its properties, books, records, employees
and auditors (i) to the extent necessary to permit Seller to prepare the
Closing Statement, (ii) to the extent necessary to permit Seller or any of its
Affiliates to comply with their financial reporting, accounting or auditing
obligations with respect to any period ending before the Closing Date with
respect to the Business or the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities, (iii)
in connection with any Action related to either the Excluded Assets and
Excluded Liabilities or the conduct of the Business or the ownership of the
Purchased Assets prior to the Closing for which Seller or such Affiliate has
retained liability under this Agreement and (iv) otherwise to the extent that
Seller, in requesting such access, reasonably deems such access necessary or
desirable in order to determine any matter relating to its rights and
obligations hereunder or otherwise in connection with its tax, regulatory,
litigation, contractual or other legitimate matters.

(h) From and after the Closing Date, and subject to Applicable Law, upon
request, Seller will give to Buyer and its authorized Representatives
reasonable access to its properties, books, records, employees and auditors
(i) to the extent necessary to permit Buyer to review the Closing Statement
and the calculations therein, (ii) to the extent necessary to permit Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to comply with their financial reporting, accounting or
auditing obligations with respect to the Business, (iii) in connection with
any Action related to either the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities or
the conduct of the Business (other than any Action in which Seller or any
Retained Subsidiary is an adverse party to Buyer or any of its Affiliates) and
(iv) otherwise to the extent that Buyer, in requesting such access, reasonably
deems such access necessary or desirable in order to determine any matter
relating to its rights and obligations hereunder or otherwise in connection
with its tax, regulatory, litigation, contractual or other legitimate matters.

(i) In furtherance of the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, Seller
and Buyer will provide and, as applicable, cause their respective employees
and their respective Affiliates and their employees to provide, all
cooperation reasonably requested by or on behalf of the other party, any of
their respective Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection
with any Assumed Liability or Excluded Liability, as the case may be, which
cooperation will include furnishing or causing to be furnished records,
information and testimony as requested by the parties, their respective
Affiliates or their respective Representatives and causing employees who
possess knowledge pertaining to any such Action to provide information,
recollections and explanations with respect thereto and make themselves
available, including for consultation with respect to settlement discussions
and to attend strategy sessions and judicial and arbitration proceedings, as
requested by any such party, their respective Affiliates or their respective
Representatives in connection therewith; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, will only be obligated to cause any
person to cooperate with the other party pursuant to this Section 7.09 if and
for so long as Buyer or Seller, as applicable, is capable of directing the
actions of such person.

(j) Any access granted to either party or its Representatives pursuant to this
Section 7.09 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the party granting such
access. The party to whom such access or other cooperation is granted pursuant
to this Section 7.09 shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead,
salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred by the other party or its
Representatives in connection therewith.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Section 7.09 shall require (A) Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to provide the
other party or its Representatives with access to (i) personnel records of
employees relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other information which, in the disclosing party's good faith
opinion, is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject such party or
its Affiliates to risk of liability or (ii) information the disclosure of
which, in the disclosing party's good faith opinion (x) would conflict with
confidentiality obligations to which such party or any of its Affiliates is
bound or (y) would reasonably be expected to result in the forfeiture or
waiver of any attorney-client or similar privilege; provided that, in the case
of this clause (y), the disclosing party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the other party, to the extent possible, with access to the
relevant information in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to
result in the forfeiture or waiver of any such attorney-client or similar
privilege, or (B) either party's independent accountants to make available to
the other party or its Representatives any work papers unless and until such
Person has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such independent accountants. No review or investigation by
Buyer or its representatives pursuant to this Section 7.09 or otherwise shall
affect the representations and warranties made by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement or the remedies of Buyer for breaches of those representations and
warranties.

Section 7.10. Use of Trademarks after Closing. Â¤ Seller hereby grants to Buyer
and the Purchased Subsidiaries a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, royalty-free license for a term of nine (9) months

which a Deferred Closing is required, for a term commencing on Closing and
ending on the date that is the later of (x) nine (9) months after the Closing
Date or (y) the Deferred Closing Date) to use the trademarks and service marks
listed in Section 2.03(d) and 7.10 of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Seller
Retained Marks"), solely in connection with the conduct of the Business as
conducted immediately prior to the Closing; provided, that Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Purchased Subsidiaries to, cease all use of the Seller
Retained Marks as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (but
with respect to a Deferred Business not earlier than the applicable Deferred
Closing Date) in accordance with this Section 7.10. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing (but with respect to a Deferred Business, not
earlier than the applicable Deferred Closing Date), but in any event, no later
than nine (9) months immediately after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Purchased Subsidiaries to, (i) cease all use of the Seller Retained

articles of association or other organizational documents with the applicable
Governmental Authorities changing the names of the Purchased Subsidiaries to
names that do not include any of the Seller Retained Marks (or any variation
or derivative thereof) or any other mark that is confusingly similar thereto.

during the limited license period provided in this Section 7.10 shall be (A)
solely in connection with goods, products and services that are (x) the type
of goods, products and services in connection with which Seller and the
Purchased Subsidiaries were using the Seller Retained Marks at the time of the
Closing and (y) of a quality at least as high as the quality of goods,
products and services provided by the Seller and the Purchased Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing and (B) subject to all style and other usage
guidelines in effect for the Seller Retained Marks immediately prior to the
Closing. All goodwill associated with the use by the Buyer and the Purchased
Subsidiaries of the Seller Retained Marks shall inure to the benefit of Seller
or its Affiliates, as applicable. Following the Closing, none of Buyer, its
Affiliates, or any of the Purchased Subsidiaries shall contest the validity or
ownership of any of the Seller Retained Marks or adopt or employ any Seller
Retained Mark (or any variation or derivative thereof) or any other mark that
is confusingly similar thereto.Nothing contained in this Section shall
prohibit uses of Seller Retained Marks that are required or permitted as a
fair use or otherwise under applicable law, or in websites and advertising,
marketing and promotional materials to refer to the historical relationship
with Seller and its Subsidiaries. Additionally, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the sale and distribution in the ordinary course of
business of any inventory or work in process as of the relevant Effective Time

the term of the license granted to Buyer and the Purchased Subsidiaries in
respect of any Deferred Business under Section 7.10(a) continues for a period
in excess of nine (9) months immediately after the Closing in accordance with
the provisions of Section 7.10(a) (such period, the "Extended Trademark
Period"), the license in respect of such Deferred Business shall be limited
during such Extended Trademark Period to use of the Seller Retained Marks
solely within the country of such Deferred Business (it being understood that
such country is, in respect of the Slovakia Deferred Business, Slovakia, in
respect of the India Deferred Business, India, and in respect of the China
Deferred Business, China).

Section 7.11. Existing Litigation Rights. o Buyer shall promptly notify Seller
in writing of any event, fact, circumstance, transaction or occurrence that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to an Existing Litigation Right. If
such Existing Litigation Right is held by a Purchased Subsidiary, Buyer shall
take all steps necessary, including executing any assignment or other
agreement in a form and substance satisfactory to Seller, to assign such
Existing Litigation Right to Seller or one of its Affiliates, as designated by
Seller.

(j) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.09, but subject to the terms
and limitations thereof, after the Closing, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller

filings documents or other materials to be submitted to any Person in
connection with a Byrd Amendment Payment (a "Byrd Amendment Filing"),

replacement, effective as of the Closing of the guaranties listed in Section

however, that Seller shall not be required to assist Buyer with the

Buyer shall be responsible for timely provision of any post-Closing pro forma

incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this Section 7.14) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
in writing specifically for use in connection with the Financing by or on
behalf of Seller or its Subsidiaries). In addition, Buyer shall, promptly upon

manner and to consummate the Financing on or prior to the Closing Date,
including the following:

(i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and not permitting any
amendment or modification to be made to, not consenting to any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, and not replacing, the Debt Commitment Letter, if
such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement: (A) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid
or original issue discount of the Financing) or (B) imposes new or additional
conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to
the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
(1) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (2) make the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less
likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto when required pursuant to this Agreement
(provided that, in any event, Buyer may (x) modify the terms (but not the
conditions) of the Financing so long as such modifications would not adversely
impact the ability of Buyer to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (y) amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities which had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof);

(ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions to the availability of the
Financing within its control;

(iii) negotiating, executing and delivering Financing documentation that
reflects the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" provisions related thereto);

(iv) in the event that the conditions set forth in Sections 10.01, 10.02 and
10.03 and the conditions to the availability of the Financing have been
satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, causing the Financing Sources
to fund the full amount of the Financing at or prior to the Closing; and

(v) enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter.

(i) At the written request of the Seller from time to time, Buyer shall keep
the Seller informed in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing. Buyer shall give the Seller prompt notice of (i) any
material breach or repudiation (or any other breach that could adversely
affect the timely availability of the Financing) by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter of which Buyer becomes aware or (ii) Buyer becoming aware
that all or any portion of the Financing becoming unavailable for any reason
(a "Financing Failure Event"). Without limiting Buyer's other obligations
under this Section 7.15, if a Financing Failure Event occurs, Buyer shall (i)
promptly notify the Seller of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons
therefor, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing
from alternative financing sources, in an amount sufficient to make the
payments required to be made at and immediately after the Closing and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, on terms that are not less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer than the Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
and when obtained, provide the Business and the Seller with a copy of, a
replacement financing commitment that provides for such alternative financing.

with respect to any of the Purchased Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax; and
(ii) there are no settlements of any prior examinations that could reasonably
be expected to adversely affect any Taxable period of any Purchased Subsidiary
for which the statute of limitations has not run or that have not been paid in

rulings or determinations, with respect to any Tax of any Purchased
Subsidiary, that are currently pending before a Taxing Authority.

(n) Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into an agreement
or arrangement with any Taxing Authority with regard to Tax liabilities of any

(o) No Purchased Subsidiary is a party to, is otherwise bound by or has any
obligation under, any Tax Sharing Agreement (other than (i) such an agreement
or arrangement exclusively between or among Seller and any of its Subsidiaries
or (ii) any commercial agreement not primarily relating to Taxes).

(p) Other than with respect to a Tax Return for which the statute of
limitations has expired, no Purchased Subsidiary (i) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than
the Seller Group) or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other
than any of the Purchased Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign income Tax law)
as a transferee or successor.

(q) No Purchased Subsidiary has participated or engaged in any transaction
that constitutes a "listed transaction" within the meaning of U.S. Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

business on the Closing Date under Section 481 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law),
(ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law)

business on the Closing Date.

(s) During the two-year period ending on the date hereof, no Purchased
Subsidiary was a distributing corporation or a controlled corporation in a
transaction intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section 355 of the
Code.

Elections.

Except with respect to Section 3.15, this Section 8.01 and Section 8.02
contain the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the Seller
with respect to Taxes.

Section 8.02. Tax Representations Relating to Purchased Assets. Except as set
forth in the Disclosure Schedule, Seller hereby represents and warrants to
Buyer that:

(g) Seller has paid (or has caused to be paid) or has withheld and remitted
(or has had withheld and remitted on its behalf) to the appropriate Taxing
Authority or has reflected an adequate accrual on the Balance Sheet (and, for
periods not covered by the Balance Sheet, through the end of the last period
for which the Retained Subsidiaries ordinarily record items on their
respective books and records) in accordance with GAAP, in each case, for Taxes
relating to the Purchased Assets, the non-payment of which would result in a
Lien on any Purchased Asset or would otherwise adversely effect Buyer or its
Affiliates after the Closing Date.

(h) No Taxing Authority has proposed, or, to the knowledge of Seller, is
threatening to propose any adjustment to any item with respect to Taxes, the
non-payment of which would result in a Lien on any Purchased Asset, on any Tax
Return of the Seller or its Subsidiaries.

(i) There is no claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding, examination or
investigation now pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened against or
with respect to Seller or its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax, the non-
payment of which would result in a Lien on any Purchased Asset.

Section 8.03. Tax Returns; Allocation of Taxes.

(d) Seller shall (i) file or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account
any extension of a required filing date), all Tax Returns with respect to the
Purchased Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on or prior to the
Closing Date and timely pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns and
(ii) file or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account any extension of
a required filing date), all Tax Returns that relate to Combined Taxes and
timely pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. All other Tax Returns
with respect to the Purchased Subsidiaries shall be filed or caused to be
filed by Buyer.

(e) Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account any
extensions of a required filing date), all Tax Returns for Income Taxes with
respect to the Purchased Subsidiaries that do not relate to Combined Taxes,
which are required to be filed by any of the Purchased Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period
(each a "Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return"). Any Pre-Closing Buyer-
Filed Income Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice and without a change of any election or any accounting method and
shall be submitted by Buyer to Seller (together with schedules, statements
and, to the extent reasonably requested by Seller, supporting documentation)
at least 30 Business Days prior to the due date (including any applicable
extension) of such return. Seller shall have the right to review and comment
on such Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return. If Seller, within 10
Business Days after review of any such Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax
Return, notifies Buyer in writing that it objects to any items in such return,
the disputed item shall be resolved in a manner mutually agreeable to both
parties within 10 Business Days, and if not so resolved, then by a jointly
retained Accounting Referee (which may be the same as or different from the
Accounting Referee retained pursuant to Section 2.11(c), if any) within a
reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such return;
provided, that Buyer shall in all cases be permitted to file such Pre-Closing
Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return by the deadline for filing such return. Upon
resolution of all such items, the relevant Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax
Return shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution, including by the filing
of an amended Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return, if such return was
filed prior to resolution of such items, and shall be binding upon the parties
without further adjustment. The costs, fees and expenses of such Accounting
Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. Except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign
law), no Purchased Subsidiary shall amend any Tax Return with respect to
Income Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period without the
prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing
Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return filed under this Section 8.03(b) in accordance
with Applicable Law. Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to any Pre-
Closing Taxes shown as due and payable on any Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income
Tax Return prepared in compliance with this Section 8.03(b), to the extent not
paid at or before Closing, by the later of (i) ten days after Buyer submits to
Seller an invoice requesting such payment and (ii) five days prior to the
latest date on which such Income Taxes are due and payable by Buyer without
interest or penalties.

(f) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller any refund of Income Taxes
and interest thereon received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or the
Purchased Subsidiaries attributable to (i) Pre-Closing Taxes that are Income
Taxes paid by Seller, the Purchased Subsidiaries or any predecessor or
Affiliate of Seller or (ii) any other Tax subject to indemnification under
Section 8.09(a), in each case no later than ten days following receipt of such
refund net of any out-of-pocket incremental expenses incurred in collecting
such refund, including Taxes imposed thereon. If any Pre-Closing Tax that is
an Income Tax paid by Seller, the Purchased Subsidiaries, or any predecessor
or Affiliate of Seller or any other Tax subject to indemnification under
Section 8.09(a) has the effect of actually reducing any Tax liability with
respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be
paid to Seller the amount of such actual reduction in Tax liability net of any
out-of-pocket incremental expenses incurred in reducing such Tax liability,
including Taxes imposed thereon.

(g) Seller shall include the Purchased Subsidiaries in any Tax Return for
Combined Taxes, as applicable, through the close of business on the Closing
Date.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Transfer
Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions described in Sections 2.01 and
2.02 of this Agreement shall be borne as follows:

(i) all Recoverable Transfer Taxes shall be borne by Buyer when due; and

(ii) all Transfer Taxes that are not Recoverable Transfer Taxes shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Seller when due and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer when
due.

Seller shall file (or cause to be filed) all necessary Tax Returns in respect
of Transfer Taxes that are required by Applicable Law to be filed by Seller.
Buyer shall file (or cause to be filed) all other Tax Returns in respect of
Transfer Taxes. If required by Applicable Law, Seller and Buyer shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in preparing and filing
and join in the execution of any such Tax Returns. Each of Buyer and Seller
shall (i) for any Transfer Taxes in respect of which it is required to file
Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 8.03(e), pay to the relevant taxing
authority any Transfer Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns and (ii) for any
Transfer Taxes in respect of which the other party is required to file Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 8.03(e), pay to the other party, within two
Business Days prior to the due date for such Transfer Taxes, any portion of
such Transfer Taxes that it is required to bear under this Section 8.03(e).

(i) Buyer and Seller agree that any advance tax payments made by System Plast
Srl to Emerson Sice Srl for the tax year ending September 30, 2015, shall be
attributed to System Plast Srl for purposes of filing Emerson Sice's Italian
consolidated corporate income tax return and System Plast Srl's separate
corporate Italian income tax return for such tax year. Buyer and Seller shall,
and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, act in a manner consistent with such
agreement.

Section 8.04. Section 338(h)(10) Elections. Â¤ Seller and Buyer (or its
applicable Affiliates) shall make elections under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and
any corresponding elections under state, local, and foreign tax law) with
respect to the purchase and sale of the Section 338(h)(10) Subsidiaries
hereunder (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Elections"), and shall file
an IRS Form 8883 reflecting such elections with respect to each Section
338(h)(10) Subsidiary in a manner consistent with the 338(h)(10) Allocation
Statement. Seller shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other
tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections on its Tax Returns to
the extent required by Applicable Law.

(d) In the event an adjustment to the Purchase Price is made pursuant to
Section 2.12 or otherwise and the Allocation Statements are accordingly
adjusted as provided in Section 2.07(e), Buyer and Seller will file an amended
IRS Form 8883 as required.

(e) Buyer represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that (x) each purchaser
of any of the Section 338(h)(10) Subsidiaries is, and that Buyer will take all
actions necessary to ensure that on the Closing Date each such purchaser will
be, eligible to make the Section 338(h)(10) Elections as contemplated by this
Agreement, and (y) neither Buyer nor any such purchaser has any plan or
intention to take, and Buyer will, and will cause each such purchaser to,
refrain from taking, any actions that could reasonably be expected to cause
any such purchaser to fail to qualify as a purchasing corporation within the
meaning of Section 338 of the Code.

Section 8.05. Cooperation on Tax Matters. Â¤ Subject to Section 8.05(b), Buyer
and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating
to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the
Purchased Subsidiaries (including access to books and records) as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns (including any report
required pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code and all Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder), the making of any election relating to Taxes, the
preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Buyer and Seller
shall either (i) retain all books and records with respect to Pre-Closing and
Straddle Tax Period Taxes pertaining to the Business, the Purchased Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities or the Purchased Subsidiaries until the date which is
8 years following the Closing Date and abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority for all periods required by
such Taxing Authority, or (ii) provide the other party with at least 30 days'
prior written notice before destroying any such books and records, during
which period the party receiving the notice can elect to take possession, at
its own expense, of such books and records. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
with each other fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes
involving the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the
Purchased Subsidiaries.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent
solely relating to the Purchased Subsidiaries, the Assumed Liabilities, or the
Purchased Assets, Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required at any time
to provide to Buyer any right to access or to review any Tax Return or Tax
work papers of Seller, any Seller Group, or any Affiliate of Seller (such Tax
Returns or Tax work papers, the "Seller Tax Records"); provided, that Seller
shall extract from Seller Tax Records and provide to Buyer any information
solely relating to the Purchased Subsidiaries, the Assumed Liabilities, or
Purchased Assets reasonably requested by Buyer.

Section 8.06. Tax Benefits. Buyer agrees to pay to Seller any Tax benefit
received by any Purchased Subsidiary, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer from the
use in any Post-Closing Tax Period of a carryforward of any Tax Asset of any
Purchased Subsidiary in respect of Income Taxes from a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
The amount of such benefit shall be considered equal to the excess of (i) the
amount of Taxes that would have been payable (or of the Tax refund, offset or
other reduction in Tax liability actually receivable) by any of the Purchased
Subsidiaries, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer in the absence of such a
carryforward over (ii) the amount of Taxes actually payable (or of the Tax
refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability that would have been
receivable in the absence of such a carryforward) by any of the Purchased
Subsidiaries, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer. Payment of the amount of such
benefit shall be made within 90 days of the filing of the applicable Tax
Return for the taxable year in which the Tax Asset in respect of Income Taxes
is utilized. If, subsequent to the payment by Buyer to Seller of any such
amount, there shall be (A) a final determination which results in a
disallowance or a reduction of the Tax Asset so carried forward or (B) a
reduction in the amount of the benefit realized by any Purchased Subsidiary,
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer from such Tax Asset in respect of Income Taxes
as a result of a final determination (or, if later, within 90 days of
notification to Buyer of such event), Seller shall repay to Buyer, within 90
days of such event described in (A) or (B), any amount which would not have
been payable to the Seller pursuant to this Section 8.06 had the amount of the
benefit been determined in light of the events.

Section 8.07. Buyer Covenants. Buyer covenants that it shall not cause or
permit any Purchased Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Buyer (a) to take any
action on the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business,
including the distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any
redemption that could give rise to any Tax liability or reduce any Tax Asset
of Seller or a Seller Group or give rise to any loss of the Seller or a Seller
Group under this Agreement, (b) to make any election or deemed election under
Section 338(g) of the Code or any comparable provision under Applicable Law
with respect to any Purchased Subsidiary in connection with the purchases
under this Agreement (other than the election described in Section 8.04) or
(c) to make or change any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or take any Tax
position on any Tax Return, take any action or enter into any transaction,
merger or restructuring that results in any increased Tax liability or
reduction of Tax Asset of the Seller or a Seller Group, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, changing the Taxable period of any Purchased Foreign
Subsidiary for any Tax year for foreign tax reporting purposes that includes
the Closing Date.

Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any Purchased Foreign
Subsidiary, for the period after Closing and through the close of each such
Purchased Foreign Subsidiary's taxable year (as defined in the Code), the
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not cause or permit such Purchased Foreign
Subsidiaries to engage in (or to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, as engaging in) the following prohibited transactions:

(i) Declare or pay a dividend or return of capital or otherwise make a
distribution with respect to capital stock;

(ii) Make or cause to be made any investment in U.S. property within the
meaning of Section 956 of the Code; or

(iii) Conduct business outside the ordinary course or engage in any
transaction outside the ordinary course (in either case based upon the
Purchased Foreign Subsidiary's historic activities) if such business or
activities are reasonably likely to generate earnings and profits of the
Purchased Foreign Subsidiary (as determined under the Code) that is taxed at a
rate materially lower than the statutory rate applicable to the Purchased
Foreign Subsidiary in the applicable jurisdiction, or would otherwise
adversely impact, the amount of the Seller or a Seller Group's associated
deemed-paid foreign taxes within the meaning of Section 902 of the Code that
are associated with the Section 1248 inclusion or the amount of the Seller or
a Seller Group's subpart F income within the meaning of Section 952 of the
Code.

Section 8.08. Tax Sharing. Any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements, except
for this Agreement, between any Purchased Subsidiary and any member of a
Seller Group shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date none
of the Purchased Subsidiaries, Seller or any Affiliate of Seller shall have
any further rights or liabilities thereunder.From and after the Closing Date,
this Agreement shall be the sole Tax Sharing Agreement relating to the
Purchased Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

Section 8.09. Tax Indemnification. Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and its
Affiliates, including the Purchased Subsidiaries, against and agrees to hold
each of them harmless from any (i) Pre-Closing Tax that is an Income Tax of
any of the Purchased Subsidiaries or any Pre-Closing Tax that is an Income Tax
attributable to the Purchased Assets, (ii) liability for the payment of any
Tax as a result of any Purchased Subsidiary being or having been before the
Closing a member of a Seller Group, (iii) liability for the payment of any Tax
arising directly from the Carve Out Plan other than a Transfer Tax, (iv)
liability for the payment of any withholding Tax arising directly from the
Cash Repatriation Plan, (v) liability for the payment of any Tax of the Seller
and the Retained Subsidiaries and (vi) liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and expenses),
arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any
Income Tax described in clauses (i) - (ii), including those incurred in the
contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to the imposition,
assessment or assertion of any such Tax, in each case incurred or suffered by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or, effective upon Closing, the Purchased
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that Seller shall have no liability for the
payment of any Tax under clauses (iii)-(iv) other than for Taxes actually
incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates, including the Purchased Subsidiaries,
and shall have no liability for any Taxes arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period
from the reduction of tax attributes as a result of the Carve Out Plan or the
Cash Repatriation Plan; provided, further, that Seller shall have no liability
for the payment of any loss attributable to or resulting from any action or
prohibited action described in Section 8.07 hereof, including an election made
or deemed made by Buyer under Section 338(g) of the Code or any comparable
provision of Applicable Law. No indemnification shall be provided under this
Section 8.09(a) or otherwise for any Tax Claim (as defined below) as to which
Buyer provides notice to Seller more than six years after Closing.

(a) Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and its Affiliates against and agrees to
hold each of them harmless from (i) any Income Tax of the Purchased
Subsidiaries that is not a Pre-Closing Tax and (ii) liabilities, costs and
expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees
and expenses) arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or
assertion of any Income Tax described in clause (i), including those incurred
in the contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to the
imposition, assessment or assertion of any such Income Tax, in each case
incurred or suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates; provided that no
indemnification shall be provided under this Section 8.09(b) or otherwise for
any Tax Claim as to which Seller provides notice to Buyer more than six years
after Closing.

(b) The amount of any indemnification payment made under this Section 8.09 by
the party making an indemnification payment under Section 8.09 (the "Tax
Indemnifying Party") shall be net of any Tax Savings realized by the party
receiving such payment (the "Tax Indemnified Party") arising from the
incurrence of the event giving rise to such payment or payment of any
indemnification payment with respect thereto. For purposes hereof, "Tax
Savings" means, with respect to any event for which an indemnification payment
is made under Section 8.09, an amount by which the net Tax liability of the
Tax Indemnified Party (or a group filing a Tax Return that includes such Tax
Indemnified Party) is actually reduced in any Tax period as a result of the
indemnified loss or the amount of a Tax refund that is generated as a result
of such indemnified loss, and any related interest received from the
applicable Taxing Authority. If the Tax Indemnified Party receives any net Tax
Savings subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Tax Indemnifying
Party, then such Tax Indemnified Party shall pay to the Tax Indemnifying Party
the amount of such net Tax Savings received by the Tax Indemnified Party, net
of any expenses incurred by such Tax Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount.

(c) If any claim or demand for Taxes in respect of which indemnity may be
sought pursuant to (i) Section 8.09(a) or Section 11.02 for breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Article 8 (any such
claim or demand, a "Tax Claim") is asserted in writing against the party which
would be entitled to seek such indemnification (the "Potential Indemnified
Party") or any of its Affiliates, the Potential Indemnified Party shall notify
the party from which such indemnification would be sought (the "Potential
Indemnifying Party") of such Tax Claim within ten days of receipt thereof, and
shall give the Potential Indemnifying Party such information with respect
thereto as the Potential Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; provided,
that the failure of the Potential Indemnified Party to give notice as provided
in this Section 8.09(d) shall not relieve any Potential Indemnifying Party of
its obligations under this Article 8 or Section 11.02, except to the extent
that such failure adversely prejudices the rights of such Potential
Indemnifying Party. The Potential Indemnifying Party may discharge, at any
time, its indemnification obligation with respect to any Tax Claim by paying
to the Potential Indemnified Party the amount payable pursuant to this Section
8.09 or Section 11.02, as the case may be, calculated on the date of such
payment. The Potential Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its own
expense, to participate in and, upon notice to the Potential Indemnified
Party, to assume the defense of any claim, suit, action, litigation or
proceeding (including any Tax audit) relating to a Tax Claim (a "Tax
Controversy"), and the Potential Indemnifying Party shall not have any
indemnification obligations with respect to any payment in respect of any
Taxes arising out of a Tax Controversy with a Taxing Authority (i) as to which
it was not afforded such right and (ii) to the extent that not being afforded
such right could reasonably be considered to adversely prejudice the Potential
Indemnifying Party. If the Potential Indemnifying Party assumes such defense,
the Potential Indemnifying Party shall have the sole discretion as to the
conduct of such defense and the Potential Indemnified Party shall have the
right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Potential Indemnifying Party. Whether or not the Potential Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute any Tax Claim, all of the parties hereto shall
cooperate and shall cause their Affiliates to cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof.

(d) The Potential Indemnifying Party shall not be liable in respect of any Tax
Claim under this Section 8.09 or Section 11.02, as the case may be, for any
Tax (i) the payment of which was made without the Potential Indemnifying
Party's prior written consent, unless the Potential Indemnified Party has
complied with the provisions set forth in Section 8.09(d) to the extent that
failing to comply with such provisions could reasonably be considered to
adversely prejudice the Potential Indemnifying Party and a final determination
of the amount of Tax has been made, (ii) resulting from a settlement effected
without the consent of the Potential Indemnifying Party or (iii) resulting
from any Tax Controversy with respect to which the Potential Indemnified Party
has not complied with the provisions set forth in Section 8.09(d) to the
extent that failing to comply with such provisions could reasonably be
expected to adversely prejudice the Potential Indemnifying Party.

Section 8.10. Purchase Price Adjustment. Any amount paid by Seller or Buyer
under Section 8.09 or Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

Section 8.11. Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the covenants and agreements contained in this Article 8 (other than
the representations and warranties contained in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02,
which shall be governed by Section 11.01) shall survive for the full period of
all statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof).

Transferred Employee who is terminated other than for cause during the
Relevant Period shall be entitled to severance or other termination-related
payments or benefits from Buyer in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of
the severance or other termination-related payments or benefits that he or she
would have received under (a) the severance plan or other similar policy of

the receipt of severance under such plan or policy or statutory or regulatory
scheme, as applicable; provided that, to the extent permitted by Applicable

accepts an offer of employment from Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries (which
offer of employment meets the requirements of this Article 9) and, as a result
of the transfer of employment from Seller or one of its Affiliates to Buyer or
one of its Affiliates, is or becomes entitled to severance benefits pursuant
to a statutory or regulatory scheme as described in (b) above, Seller shall be
responsible for paying such severance benefits, subject to such Transferred
Employee's execution, delivery and non-revocation of a release as provided
above; provided that Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate in good faith to
reduce or eliminate, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, such
Transferred Employee's entitlement to such severance benefits. Buyer agrees
that after the expiration of the Relevant Period, any remaining Transferred

if Buyer and its Subsidiaries do not have similarly situated employees,
Buyer's general severance policies, if any).

following the Applicable Transfer Time with Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.
Buyer shall, or shall cause, each Transferred Employee who is eligible to

hereof (or who as of a date not later than the expiration of the Relevant
Period would have been eligible to participate in such a retiree medical plan
had such Transferred Employee's employment with Seller and its Affiliates
continued through such eligibility date) to participate in, for the Relevant
Period, a retiree medical plan of Buyer or its Affiliates providing retiree
medical benefits that are no less favorable than the retiree medical benefits
available (or to be made available on satisfaction of the applicable
eligibility criteria) to active employees of Buyer taking into account the
service credit provisions of Section 9.10 and any service following the
Applicable Transfer Time with Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries and providing
that each such Transferred Employee will have a retiree cost-sharing
percentage that is substantially similar to the retiree cost-sharing
percentage as provided in the applicable retiree medical plan of Seller or its
Affiliates

claims for benefits (other than claims under Purchased Subsidiary Benefit
Plans and Assumed Plans) in respect of workers compensation and any comparable
liabilities that are based upon Transferred Employees' injuries or illnesses
that arise prior to the Applicable Transfer Time. For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller's and Buyer's respective obligations under this Section 9.15 shall be

Services Agreement) and (ii) to satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, the
information and consultation requirements of the Transfer Regulations as they
apply to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (including
the termination of the Transition Services Agreement). Without prejudice to
the foregoing, Buyer shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) promptly, and
in any event not later than 30 days after the date of this Agreement and not
less than 60 days prior to the Applicable Transfer Time, disclose to Seller
accurate details of its proposed measures to enable Seller and its Affiliates
to comply with its or their information and consultation obligations pursuant
to the Transfer Regulations.

Section 9.19. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the generality of
the last sentence of Section 13.07, nothing in this Article 9, express or
implied, (a) is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto, including any Business Employee, any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (b) shall
establish, or constitute an amendment, termination or modification of, or an
undertaking to amend, establish, terminate or modify, any benefit plan,

Article 11

compliance with its obligations under Section 7.01; provided that the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.05, 3.14,

otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding two sentences, if notice of the
breach or inaccuracy thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have

suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of or
relating to, without duplication:

(viii) any breach of any representation or warranty made in this agreement or
in any Transaction Document (each such breach, a "Warranty Breach") by Seller
or any of its Affiliates, except any Warranty Breach relating to Income Tax,
disregarding any qualification in the text of the relevant representation or
warranty as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect (other than such
qualifications contained in the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.06(a), clause (C) of Section 3.06(b), Section 3.07(b), Section

(xiii) any Liability of a Purchased Subsidiary arising out of the matters
identified in Section 11.02(a)(vi) of the Disclosure Schedule;

unless the Damages with respect to such Warranty Breach or any group of
Warranty Breaches relating to the same claim or incident exceed $200,000 (the
"De Minimis Amount"), (B) Seller shall not be liable in respect of any such

such excess, and (C) Seller's maximum liability for all Warranty Breaches
shall not exceed $75,000,000 (the "Cap") , provided further, however, that (i)
the Deductible shall not apply to Warranty Breaches of Sections 3.09(b),
3.09(c) and 3.09(d), (ii) neither the Deductible nor the Cap shall apply to
Warranty Breaches for breaches of the Seller's Fundamental Representations and
(iii) the Seller's maximum liability for all Warranty Breaches (including
breaches of the Seller's Fundamental Representations) shall not exceed the
Purchase Price.

(j) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer indemnifies Seller and its
Affiliates against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all
Damages incurred or suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates to the extent
arising out of or relating to, without duplication:

(i) any Warranty Breach by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, disregarding any
qualification in the text of the relevant representation or warranty as to
materiality or material adverse effect;

(ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement;

(iii) Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of the Purchased Subsidiaries no

until the aggregate amount of all Damages above the De Minimis Amount exceed

further, however, that (i) neither the Deductible nor the Cap shall apply to
Warranty Breaches for breaches of the Buyer's Fundamental Representations and

breaches of the Buyer's Fundamental Representations) shall not exceed the
Purchase Price.

Section 11.03. Procedures. Â¤ Each Person seeking indemnification under this
Article 11 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt notice to the Person
from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any Action by any third party
("Third Party Claim"); provided that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
give notice as provided in this Section 11.03(a) shall not relieve any
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 11.02, except to the
extent that such failure adversely prejudices the rights of any such
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information
then available to the Indemnified Party). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all written
notices and documents (including any court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall
provide the Indemnifying Party with such other information with respect to any
such Third Party Claim reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice and, subject to the limitations set forth
in this Section 11.03, to assume control of, and defend against, negotiate,
settle (subject to clause (b)) or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim,
but the Indemnified Party may nonetheless participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim or resolve any Environmental Matter
pursuant to this Article 11, then the Indemnified Party may defend against,
negotiate, settle (subject to clause (b)) or otherwise deal with such Third
Party Claim or Environmental Matter at the Indemnifying Party's expense. If
the Indemnifying Party shall, assume the defense of any Third Party Claim or
the resolution of any Environmental Matter pursuant to this Article 11, then
the Indemnified Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the
defense of such Third Party Claim or Environmental Matter, as applicable;
provided that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any
such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if
(i) requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnifying Party, a material conflict
exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would
make such separate representation advisable; provided, further that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel
(in addition to local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection with
any Third Party Claim or Environmental Matter.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.03 to the contrary, neither
the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required for any such
settlement if (i) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid
in full by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) such settlement does not permit any
order, injunction or other equitable relief to be entered, directly or
indirectly, against the Indemnified Party and (iii) such settlement includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on
claims that are the subject matter of such Third Party Claim and does not
include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or failure
to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person. If the Indemnifying Party
makes any payment on any Third Party Claim or in respect of any Environmental
Matter, then the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance
benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim or Environmental Matter, as applicable.

(g) After any decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, or a settlement shall have
been consummated (in accordance with this Article 11), or the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to a Third Party Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party
shall forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter.

(h) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 11.03 or the following Section
11.04 shall not apply to indemnification for a Tax Claim. The procedures for
such indemnification shall be governed by Section 8.09.

Section 11.04. Direct Claim Procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party has
a claim for indemnity under Section 11.02 against an Indemnifying Party that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give
prompt notice in writing, and as promptly as practicable, of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party, which notice shall in no event be delivered to the
Indemnifying Party later than 60 days after the Indemnified Party first learns
of the facts on which such claim is based (such 60-day period, the "Notice
Period") (it being agreed that knowledge of the Business Employees as of the
Applicable Transfer Time with respect to facts or circumstances existing prior
to such Applicable Transfer Time shall not be imputed to Buyer or its
Affiliates or Representatives for this purpose). Such notice shall set forth
in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification and the
amount of such Damages incurred or that such Indemnified Party reasonably
estimates in good faith is likely to be incurred in connection with such claim
(taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party).
The failure to notify the Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable within
the Notice Period shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that such failure shall have actually
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

Section 11.05. Environmental Matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Article 11 and without limiting the paragraph at the end of Section
11.02(a), with respect to any claim for indemnification hereunder for any
Retained Environmental Liability or Warranty Breach of Section 3.16 or for
indemnification under Section 11.02(a)(x) (but solely with respect to Section
2.05(j)) (collectively, "Environmental Matters"), the parties agree on behalf
of themselves and their respective Affiliates that, in addition to the other
provisions set forth in Article 11, (and in the case of any conflict between
the provisions of this Section 11.05 and any other provision in Article 11,
the provisions of this Section 11.05 shall prevail and apply):

(m) Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement for any Damages (i)
arising out of or resulting from any testing, sampling or other invasive
investigation of, or Remedial Action relating to the air, soil, soil gas,
surface water, groundwater, sediment, building materials or other
environmental media conducted by or on behalf or at the direction of the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including, on and after the Closing, the Purchased
Subsidiaries) or any disclosure, report or communication to, or initiation or
encouragement of any action by, any Governmental Authority or other third
party relating to any Environmental Matter undertaken by or on behalf or at
the direction of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, on and after
the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) unless, to the extent performed by or
on behalf or at the direction of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, on and after the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries), (1) it was
required by an Environmental Law to undertake such investigation, sampling,
testing, Remedial Action, disclosure, report, communication, initiation or
encouragement, (2) such investigation, sampling, testing, Remedial Action,
disclosure, report, communication, initiation or encouragement was reasonably
necessary to defend or resolve a Third Party Claim that is not being defended
or controlled by Seller or its Affiliates, (3) such investigation, sampling,
testing, Remedial Action, disclosure, report, communication, initiation or
encouragement was reasonably necessary to respond to or correct an imminent
and substantial threat of a risk to human health or the environment; and/or
(4) such investigation, sampling, testing, Remedial Action, disclosure,
report, communication, initiation or encouragement was reasonably necessary
for the construction, maintenance and/or repair of the Purchased Assets, the
Real Property or any asset of a Purchased Subsidiary, which construction,
maintenance and/or repair is performed for a legitimate and bona fide business
purpose and would be performed in the ordinary course and, in the case of (2),
(3) and (4) of this Section 11.05(a)(i), such defense or resolution, response
or correction, or construction, maintenance and/or repair would be performed
or undertaken without regard to the possible existence of a right to
indemnification under any Transaction Document or (ii) other than as described
this Section 11.05(a)(i), arising in connection with any change in use,
shutdown, demolition, financing or closure of any asset, facility or real
property on or after the Closing.

(n) Any obligation of Seller to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party (including
as of the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) for any Environmental Matter
shall be limited to, and its obligations under this Agreement shall be
satisfied upon achievement of, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, the
minimum standards required to be met, based on the use of the relevant
property as of the Closing Date, by applicable Environmental Laws as in effect
at the time such Environmental Matter is addressed or by any order or
requirement of a Governmental Authority. Both parties expressly agree that
such minimum standards may include risk-based clean-up remedies and standards
and/or the imposition of engineering or institutional controls such as deed or
other use restrictions.

(o) Seller has the right (but not the obligation) to retain the defense and
control of any Environmental Matter, including the disclosure, investigation,
negotiation, performance and settlement thereof and Remedial Action relating
thereto. In connection with such, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and representatives, to cooperate regarding the resolution of any
such Environmental Matter, including providing to Seller and its
representatives with all necessary accommodations, including access to
relevant properties and site utilities subject, if relevant, to landlord
consents, in order to allow Seller and its representatives to respond to,
defend, and conduct Remedial Action relating to such Environmental Matter.
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not unreasonably interfere with or disturb the
performance by Seller and its representatives of any such Remedial Action. In
connection with any such Environmental Matter which Seller is defending or
controlling, Seller shall (i) keep Buyer reasonably informed relating to the
progress of such Environmental Matter (including providing Buyer with copies
of all material plans and reports submitted to Governmental Authorities); (ii)
diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof; and (iii) not
unreasonably interfere with the continuing use of such relevant property, as
long as the manner of use does not materially differ from the manner it is
being used as of the Closing.

(p) Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement for any Damages with
respect to Environmental Matters to the extent such Damages have been caused,
exacerbated, compounded or aggravated by acts or omissions of or on behalf of
Buyer or its Affiliates (including, as of the Closing, the Purchased
Subsidiaries), or any employee, agent, contractor, consultant, attorney,
tenant, lessee, sublessee, licensee, permittee or invitee of any of the
foregoing.

(q) Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, Seller shall have no
liability under this Agreement for any Damages relating to any Environmental
Matters to the extent arising from the coming into force of, or the change in,
any Environmental Law on or after Closing.

(r) The parties understand that Seller and Emerson Power Transmission
Corporation are original parties to the Settlement Agreement dated October 30,
1990 with Borg-Warner Corporation ("1990 Agreement") which 1990 Agreement
relates to certain Retained Environmental Liabilities. From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, as of the
Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) to not, exercise any rights they may have
under the 1990 Settlement Agreement, other than as may be directed by Seller.

Section 11.06. Calculation of Damages. Â¤ The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 8.09 or Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of
any (i) amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible therefor, and (ii) amount by which the net Tax liability of the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates is actually reduced in any Tax period as a
result of the indemnified loss or the amount of a Tax refund that is generated
as a result of such indemnified loss, and any related interest received from
the applicable Taxing Authority. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to file, notice and pursue any claims under the Indemnified
Party's applicable insurance policies that cover any indemnifiable Damages
hereunder. If the Indemnified Party (i) receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any
Damages, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any payment made or out-of-pocket expense incurred by such
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses
incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount or (ii) receives
any net Tax benefit subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such net Tax benefit (as computed pursuant to
this Section 11.06), net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

(g) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 8.09 or Section
11.02 for any (i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (A) where
Seller is the Indemnifying Party, there is included in the consolidated and
combined balance sheet comprising the Draft Audit Report a specific liability
or reserve relating to and identifying such matter or (B) the Indemnified
Party had otherwise been compensated for such matter pursuant to the
calculation of Modified Net Asset Value or the adjustment of the Purchase
Price under Section 2.10, Section 2.12 or otherwise, (ii) consequential,
incidental, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or other similar Damages
unless such Damages are actually paid to a third party or (iii) Damages for
lost profits or diminution in value or (iv) Damages that would not exist if
not for or to the extent aggravated by, any act or wrongful omission of the
Indemnified Party.

(h) Each Indemnified Party must mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any
loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying
Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of
this Agreement in respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value
of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the
Indemnified Party's reasonable costs of mitigation) within five (5) Business
Days after the benefit is received.

(i) Each Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to
collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 11.02.

(j) Each party agrees that it shall not, and agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that its Affiliates do not, voluntarily or by discretionary
action, accelerate the timing, or increase the cost of, any obligations of the
other party under this Article 11.

(k) Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement (for the
avoidance of doubt, including any payment made pursuant to Article 8) shall be
treated by Buyer and Seller as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

Section 11.07. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates could have recovered
all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor")
based on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall assign, or cause its Affiliates to assign, such of its
rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit
the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment.

Section 11.08. Exclusivity. From and after the Closing, except as specifically
set forth in this Agreement, each party waives any rights and claims it may
have against the other party, whether at law or in equity, relating to the
Business, the Purchased Subsidiaries, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the transactions contemplated hereby. For the sake of clarity,
from and after the Closing, except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, each party expressly waives and agrees to cause its respective
Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, to waive any rights
and claims they may have against the other party and its respective Affiliates
relating to the Business, the Purchased Subsidiaries, the Purchased Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities, including such claims for contribution or other
rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law
(whether now or hereinafter in effect), including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. Â§ 9601, et
seq., or to any Hazardous Substances, claims for breach of contract, breach of
representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims
for breach of duty. After the Closing, Sections 2.12, 7.05, 7.08, 7.13, 7.14,
Article 8, Article 9, Article 11 and Section 13.08 shall provide the exclusive
remedy for any claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions

Article 12 
Termination

Section 12.01. Grounds for Termination. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 12.01 of the Disclosure Schedules, this Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

(k) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

(l) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated
on or before the first day of the calendar month that first begins after the
date that is six (6) months after the date hereof (as may be extended, the
"End Date"); provided that, if on the End Date, all the conditions to Closing
contained in Article 10 have been satisfied (other than those that, by their
terms, are capable of being satisfied only at Closing) other than (x) the
condition set forth in Section 10.01(a), (y) receipt of one or more consents
and approvals listed on Section 10.01(b) of the Disclosure Schedule or (z) the
condition set forth in Section 10.01(c) to the extent relating to any
Competition Law, then Seller or Buyer may, by written notice to the other
party, extend the End Date to the first day of the calendar month beginning
after the date that is nine (9) months after the date hereof, and all
references to the term "End Date" shall be deemed to mean the End Date as so
extended; provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 12.01(b) shall not be available to any party whose
breach of any provisions of this Agreement (including due to a failure to use
reasonable best efforts in connection with the actions specified in Section
7.01 to the extent required thereunder) has caused or resulted in the failure
of the Closing to be consummated by such time;

(m) by either Seller or Buyer, if after the date of this Agreement any
Governmental Authority shall have issued, enacted, promulgated or enforced any
Applicable Law that (A) in the case of an Applicable Law not covered in clause
(B), makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or
otherwise prohibited or (B) in the case of an Applicable Law that is a
judgment, order or injunction of a court, permanently enjoins Buyer or Seller
from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby and such injunction
shall have become final and nonappealable, provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(c) shall not (x) apply
in respect of any Deferred Closing Actions and (y) be available to any party
whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has caused or resulted in such
Applicable Law being enacted or becoming applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby (including due to a failure to use reasonable best efforts
in connection with the actions specified in Section 7.01 to the extent
required thereunder);

(n) by Buyer if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 10.02(a) or 10.02(b) not to be satisfied, and such conditions are
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; provided that Buyer is not then
in breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in
Section 10.01 or 10.03 not to be satisfied; or

(o) by Seller if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 10.03(a) or Section 10.03(b) not to be satisfied, and such conditions
are incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; provided that Seller is not
then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 10.01 or Section 10.02 not to be satisfied.

Other than in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 12.01(a), the
party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any clause of this
Section 12.01 shall give written notice of such termination to the other
party.

Section 12.02. Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise provided in Section
12.03, if this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 12.01, such
termination shall be without liability of either party (or any stockholder,
Affiliate or Representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of this
Section 12.02 and Section 12.03 and the provisions of Sections 6.01, 7.03 and
Article 13 shall survive any such termination; and provided, further that the
termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party hereto from any
liability for (i) fraud or (ii) any willful and material breach of, or willful
and material failure to perform any obligation under, any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement

Section 12.03. Termination Fee. (j) If this Agreement is terminated:

(iv) by Seller or Buyer pursuant to Section 12.01(b) and as of the time of
such termination (x) one or more of the conditions set forth in Sections
10.01(a), 10.01(b) or 10.01(c) (in the case of Section 10.01(c), only as it
applies to any Competition Law) have not been satisfied and (y) all of the
other conditions set forth in Section 10.01 and Section 10.02 have been
satisfied (other than any such conditions that by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the Closing Date, but which conditions could be satisfied if
the Closing Date were the date of such termination); or

(v) by Seller or Buyer pursuant to Section 12.01(c) as a result of any
Competition Law or application thereof, and, as of the time of such
termination all of the conditions set forth in Section 10.02 (other than
Section 10.02(d)) have been satisfied (other than any such conditions that by
their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but which conditions
could be satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination);

the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Seller $75,000,000 (the
"Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds
contemporaneously with and as a condition to such termination (in the case of
a termination by Buyer) or within five (5) Business Days after such
termination (in the case of a termination by Seller), it being understood that
in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once,
and that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be in addition to, and not
in lieu of, any other remedy available to Seller, whether at law or in equity,
but, once paid, shall be offset or applied against any remedy for damages
hereunder to the extent such damages are attributable to a claim for breach of
the Buyer's obligation under this Agreement to the extent applicable to
Competition Laws; provided that, any interest paid or payable on the
Termination Fee pursuant to the following sentence shall not be so applied or
offset. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.15, if all or
any part of the Termination Fee is not paid when due pursuant to this Section
12.03, the unpaid portion of the Termination Fee shall accrue interest at a
rate of 8% per annum, compounding monthly, from and including the date the
Termination Fee was required to be paid, to but excluding the date of payment.

(g) The Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 12.03
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Seller would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Buyer fails to pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 12.03 within five (5) Business Days of the date when due, it
shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by the Seller in connection
with any legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment
against the Buyer, and Seller shall pay any costs and expenses incurred by
Buyer in connection with any such legal action that results in a judgment in
favor of the Buyer.

or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be

(h) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or

its obligations hereunder.

Section 13.05. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

Section 13.06. Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. The parties hereto agree
that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State
court sitting in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have
subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any
cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen
from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. The parties hereto acknowledge and irrevocably
agrees (i) that any action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract or in
tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation brought against any

hereby, any Financing or the performance of services thereunder shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York, Borough of Manhattan, or if under Applicable Law

District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts
thereof) and each party submits for itself and its property with respect to
any such legal action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court and (ii) not
to bring or support anyone else in bringing any action, claim, cause of action
or suit (in contract or in tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or
investigation against any Financing Source arising out of, or relating to, the
transactions contemplated hereby, any Financing or the performance of services
thereunder in any other court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 13.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.EACH OF THE PARTIES
TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND SHALL CAUSE ITS SUBSIDIARIES
AND AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
DEBT FINANCING (OR AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE), ANY OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

Section 13.07. Counterparts; Effectiveness; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations,
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 13.07 to the contrary, each Financing Source in
connection with the Financing is an express third party beneficiary of
Sections 13.02(c), 13.06, 13.15 and this Section 13.07 to the extent such
sections are applicable to such Financing Source.

Section 13.08. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement (including failing to
take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby) were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, or
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof or
thereof in any federal court located in the State of New York or, to the
extent that no such federal court has jurisdiction over such proceeding, in
any New York state court (and, in any event, in accordance with Section
13.06), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, (a) any and all defenses to any
action for specific performance hereunder, including any defense based on the
claim that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement to post a
bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

Section 13.09. Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 13.10. Bulk Sales Laws. Buyer and Seller each hereby waive compliance
by Seller with the provisions of the "bulk sales", "bulk transfer" or similar
laws of any state in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets.

Section 13.11. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 13.12. Disclosure Schedule. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
matters reflected on the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to
matters required to be reflected therein, (ii) the inclusion of any items or
information in the Disclosure Schedule that are not required by this Agreement
to be so included is solely for the convenience of Buyer, (iii) the disclosure
by Seller of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgement by Seller that the matter is required to be
disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material, (iv)
if any section of the Disclosure Schedule lists an item or information in such
a way as to make its relevance to the disclosure required by or provided in
another section of the Disclosure Schedule or the statements contained in any
Section of Article 3 reasonably apparent, the matter shall be deemed to have
been disclosed in or with respect to such other section, notwithstanding the
omission of an appropriate cross-reference to such other section or the
omission of a reference in the particular representation and warranty to such
section of the Disclosure Schedule, (v) except as provided in clause (iv)
above, headings have been inserted in the Disclosure Schedule for convenience
of reference only, (vi) the Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety
by reference to specific provisions of this Agreement and (vii) the Disclosure
Schedule and the information and statements contained therein are not intended
to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations or
warranties of Seller except as and to the extent provided in this Agreement.

Section 13.13. No Recourse. Without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement, it is hereby agreed and acknowledged that this Agreement may only
be enforced against, and any claims of action that may be based upon, arise
out of, or relate to, this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be made against the parties hereto,
and no former, current or future Affiliates, officers, directors, managers,
employees, equityholders, managers, members, partners, agents or
representatives of Seller or Buyer, in each case who is not a party to this
Agreement shall have any liability for any obligations of the parties hereto
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 13.14. Currency. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall
mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in
U.S. dollars. The parties agree that to the extent this Agreement provides for
any valuation, measurement or test as of a given date based on an amount
specified in U.S. dollars and the subjects of such valuation, measurement or
test are comprised of items or matters that are, in whole or in part,
denominated other than in U.S. dollars, such non-U.S. dollar amounts shall be
converted into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate that will be the MID Fixing
Rate at 11:00 AM New York time as of the second Business Day prior to such
date quoted by WM/Reuters for U.S. dollars to amounts of such non-U.S.
currency. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 13.14 shall not impact the
calculation of Modified Net Asset Value or any amounts set forth on the
Audited Financial Statements.

Section 13.15. Financing Sources. The Seller and its Affiliates hereby agree
that (a) in no event shall the Financing Sources have any liability or
obligation to the Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing, any commitment
letters or engagement letters relating thereto or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby and (b) in no event shall the Seller or any of
its Affiliates or stockholders seek or obtain any other damages of any kind
against any Financing Source (including consequential, special, indirect or
punitive damages). The provisions of this Section 13.15 shall inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Financing Source, its Affiliates and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which is hereby
intended to be an express third party beneficiary of this Section 13.15.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.15, following
Closing, such provisions will not limit the rights of the parties to the
Financing under the Definitive Financing Agreements.
