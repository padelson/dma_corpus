THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into as of

acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement
and Delaware Law, on the Closing Date, Parent, the Company, and Merger Sub
shall effect the Merger by filing a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall become effective upon
the acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the
Certificate of Merger or such other time as may be specified therein (the
"Effective Time").

1.2 The Closing. Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1,
the Transactions shall be consummated at a closing (the "Closing") on the
second (2nd) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (if permissible
hereunder) of the conditions set forth in Annex A, unless another date is
mutually agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company (such date, the
"Closing Date").

1.3 Effects of the Merger on the Entities. The certificate of incorporation
and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to be identical to the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, respectively, of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
that of the Company). The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time. At the Effective
Time, the other effects of the Merger shall be as provided by the Certificate
of Merger and Delaware Law.

1.4 Effect of Merger on the Capital Stock; Merger Sub Capital Stock. At the
Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one share of Company Common Stock (and there shall be no other
shares of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding).

(a) Company Capital Stock; Company Options.

(i) Company Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Capital Stock (excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive, in each case in accordance with and
pursuant to the terms hereof, the Charter Documents and Delaware Law, (1) the
portion of the Total Closing Consideration such share is so entitled to
receive, plus (2) the portion of the Escrow Amount (if any) that is released
pursuant to the terms hereof and which such share is so entitled to receive,
plus (3) the portion of the Representative Expense Amount (if any) that is
released pursuant to the terms hereof and which such share is so entitled to
receive. All such amounts and calculations and components thereof shall be set
forth in the Closing Payment Spreadsheet. For clarity, a portion of the Escrow
Amount and the Representative Expense Amount shall be withheld at the Closing
and deposited into the Escrow Fund and the Representative Expense Fund,
respectively, and distributed in accordance with the terms hereof and the
Escrow Agreement, as the case may be.

(ii) Cancelled Shares; Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time, each share of
Company Capital Stock that is issued and outstanding and held by the Company
or any Subsidiary as of



OMITTED SCHEDULES AND EXHIBIT



Certain schedules and exhibits to this Agreement and Plan of Merger have been
omitted pursuant to Item 601(a)(5) of Regulation Sâ€‘K. Veeva Systems Inc.
hereby undertakes to provide to the Securities and Exchange Commission copies
of such documents upon request; provided, however, that Veeva Systems Inc.
reserves the right to request confidential treatment for portions of any such 

immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Cancelled Shares") shall be
cancelled without any consideration therefor. At the Effective Time, each
share of Company Capital Stock with respect to which the holder thereof has
properly demanded and not effectively withdrawn or lost appraisal rights under
Delaware Law ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the consideration set forth in Section 1.4(a)(i) but instead shall be
entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law; provided, however
that if any holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws, loses or fails
to perfect such holder's appraisal rights, then such holder's shares shall be
converted into the right to receive, upon the terms of this Agreement, the
consideration set forth in Section 1.4(a)(i) (without interest). The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice and a copy of any demand for appraisal
received by the Company and/or any of its Affiliates. Neither the Surviving
Corporation nor the Stockholder Representative shall make any payment with
respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands
without the prior written consent of Parent.

(iii) Company Options. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will
assume any Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option
that is outstanding, unexpired and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, net of
each Vested Company Option's exercise price and, in each case pursuant to the
terms hereof, the applicable Plan, any applicable Contract between the holder
thereof and the Company: (1) the portion of the Total Closing Consideration
such Vested Company Option is entitled to receive, plus (2) the portion of the
Escrow Amount (if any) that is released pursuant to the terms hereof and which
such Vested Company Option is so entitled to receive, plus (3) the portion of
the Representative Expense Amount (if any) that is released pursuant to the
terms hereof and which such Vested Company Option is so entitled to receive.
At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option that is outstanding,
unexpired and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a Continuing Employee (other than a Key Employee) shall be converted
into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, subject to the same
vesting conditions (except acceleration) and proportionate exercise price
(based on the Exchange Ratio) as were applicable to such Unvested Company
Option and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the Parent
Equity Plan and an option agreement thereunder. The shares into which such
Unvested Company Option are exercisable and the exercise price of such
Unvested Company Option shall be converted based on the Exchange Ratio, as
Parent may reasonably determine in a manner consistent with the terms hereof
and in consultation with the Company. At the Effective Time, each Unvested
Company Option that is outstanding, unexpired and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by either a Key Employee or a
Person that is not a Continuing Employee shall be cancelled and terminated for
no consideration. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, cause to be
taken all actions necessary to effectuate the terms of this Section
1.4(b)(iii) and to ensure that no holder of Company Options shall have any
rights from and after the Effective Time with respect to any Company Options
except as expressly provided in this Section 1.4(b)(iii). All such amounts and
calculations and components thereof shall be set forth in the Closing Payment
Spreadsheet.

(iv) Calculation of Total Closing Consideration. For clarity, the portion of
the Total Closing Consideration that a share of Company Capital Stock or a
share underlying a Vested Company Option is entitled to receive under Section
1.4(b) shall be calculated on a "fully diluted" basis (meaning the Total
Closing Consideration shall be allocated among (i) all shares of Company
Capital Stock issued and outstanding and (ii) all shares issuable upon
exercise of any Vested Company Option). The calculation of such "fully
diluted" amount shall be set forth in the Closing Payment Spreadsheet.

1.5 Payment of Merger Consideration for Company Capital Stock; Paying Agent.
PNC Bank, National Association shall serve as the paying agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the Merger pursuant to the terms hereof and the Paying Agent
Agreement. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and deliver all materials to
the Paying Agent as are reasonably required by the Paying Agent.

(a) Closing Payments. One (1) Business Day after the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause to be paid to the Paying Agent the amount of cash payable to the
Stockholders and holders of Vested Company Options (to the extent such holders
are not able to be paid through the Company's payroll) at Closing pursuant to
Section 1.4(a)(i), the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent to hold in trust as
an escrow fund (the "Escrow 

Fund") and the Representative Expense Amount to the Stockholder Representative
to be used as provided for in Section 7.5 (the "Representative Expense Fund"),
in each case as set forth on the Closing Payment Spreadsheet.

(b) Pre-Closing Statement. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement (the "Pre-
Closing Statement") setting forth (i) an estimated consolidated balance sheet
of the Company as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) an estimate of the amount of Closing Net
Working Capital (including each component thereof), (iii) the Closing Cash,
(iv) the Specified Liabilities, including wire instructions for each payment
to be made at the Closing in respect thereof (the "Statement of Specified
Liabilities") and (v) a calculation of the Total Consideration on the basis of
the foregoing. The Pre-Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP and the Most Recent Pre-Signing Audit, and after reflecting any
reasonable and good faith comments made by Parent prior to the Closing, the
Total Consideration so calculated shall be the basis of the Closing Payment
Spreadsheet and the payments made at Closing pursuant to Section 1.4.

(c) Payment Spreadsheets. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has delivered
a completed payment spreadsheet (the "Signing Payment Spreadsheet"), which
shall be attached hereto and include all of the information necessary for
Parent to perform its obligations under Section 1.4 and this Section 1.5,
calculated as if the Closing Date were the date hereof, which shall represent
Company's reasonable and good faith determination of such information as of
the date hereof. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent a completed payment spreadsheet (the
"Closing Payment Spreadsheet"), in the same form as the Signing Payment
Spreadsheet, which shall include all of the information necessary for Parent
to perform its obligations under Section 1.4 and this Section 1.5, updated to
be calculated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be
true, correct, and complete in all respects as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent and the Paying Agent may rely without any liability to
any Person upon the Closing Payment Spreadsheet in making payments pursuant to
this Agreement.

(d) Payment Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date, the Paying Agent shall mail exchange documents that Parent, the Company
and the Paying Agent may reasonably require to effectuate the payments to be
made under Section 1.4 hereof (the "Exchange Documents"), to the respective
addresses of the Stockholders and holders of Vested Company Options (to the
extent such holders are not able to be paid through the Company's payroll) set
forth in the Closing Payment Spreadsheet. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the receipt of duly completed Exchange Documents and any other document
Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the Paying Agent shall
cause to be delivered an amount equal to the amount of cash to which the
holders are entitled hereunder at the Closing pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and the delivery information contained in the Exchange Documents.
Parent shall cause holders of Vested Company Options who are able to be paid
through the Company's payroll to be so paid as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Closing, and any other holders of Vested Company Options
to be paid as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing through the
Paying Agent.

(e) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. Following the
consummation of the Merger, the cash amounts paid in respect of the surrender
for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Capital Stock, and if any certificates representing the
same are presented to the Surviving Corporation after such time for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

(f) Withholding Taxes. Any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under applicable Legal Requirements and shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

assets or properties or the nature of its business make such qualification or
license necessary to the Company's business as currently conducted, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not be material. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are not in violation of any provision of the
Charter Documents in any material respect. All of the equity interests of each
Subsidiary are owned of record and beneficially by the Company, without any
right, restriction, option, warrant, call, put or other right with respect to
the delivery, transfer, issuance of such equity interests and without any
Contract with respect to voting or transfer thereof.

Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company and its securityholders and no further corporate or
other action is required on the part of the Company or its securityholders to

certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock are capable of being
lost, stolen or destroyed. Except for the Plans, neither the Company nor any

providing for equity-related compensation to any Person. As of the date
hereof, the Signing Payment Spreadsheet contains, and as of the Closing, the
Closing Payment Spreadsheet will contain, a true, complete and correct list of
the amount of shares reserved, issuable upon exercise and issued, pursuant to
the Plans, and with respect to each Company Option, the holder thereof, shares

Statements will present, fairly, in all material respects, the Company's
consolidated financial condition, operating results and cash flows as of the
dates and during the periods indicated therein. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any liability of any nature (whether or not required to be

of $100,000, except for those (a) which have been reflected in the Current
Balance Sheet, (b) were incurred pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) which have
arisen in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices (but
not any for violations of any Legal Requirement or breach of any Contract).
Since the Balance Sheet Date, the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries
has been conducted, in all material respects, in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice, and no Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred.

2.7 Tax Matters. Each Tax Return required to be filed by the Company or any
Subsidiary (i) has been timely filed; and (ii) has been accurately and
completely prepared in all material respects in compliance with all applicable
Legal Requirements. All Taxes required to be paid or withheld by the Company
or any Subsidiary have been timely paid or withheld. The Tax Amount will be

owns any real property. There are no other parties occupying, or with a right
to occupy, any real property leased by the Company. The Company and each
Subsidiary has good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties
and leased assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its material tangible
properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in its
business, free and clear of any Liens, except for Permitted Liens. 

2.9 Intellectual Property. The Company exclusively owns or has valid and
sufficient license rights (and will continue to own or have a license after
the Closing) all patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, data, software
code, and trade secrets ("IP") embodied in the Company products or services or
otherwise used in the operation of the Company's business (the "Company IP")
free and clear of any Liens (other than nonexclusive licenses to use Company
products granted to customers in the ordinary course on the Company's standard
forms that have been Made Available). The Company has used commercially
reasonable efforts to secure, protect and maintain the Company IP, including
maintenance of all Company IP registered with any patent and trademark office.
The Company has entered into adequate written IP assignment and
confidentiality agreements with all Employees that have had access to Company
confidential information or engaged in development of Company technology or
Company IP. The Company has adequate and sufficient rights for the use of all
third party technology and IP as such third party technology IP is
incorporated, embodied or otherwise used in the Company products or services
or otherwise used in the operation of the Company's business, and is in
compliance with all associated licenses and agreements governing the use of
such technology and IP. The Company has not used in its business, or
incorporated into its products, any open source software in any manner that
may require Company to distribute or license any Company authored software or
other Company IP to be disclosed in source code form or licensed for the
purpose of further modification or distribution. The operation of the
Company's business, as previously conducted and as presently conducted, has
not and will not infringe or violate any IP or other rights of any third party
(or exceed the scope of any applicable agreement with or license from any
third party), and Company is not aware of any pending or threatened allegation
or claim of such infringement or violation. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not result in the grant or expansion of
any rights, licenses, or encumbrances on, or loss or modification of any right
to, any Company IP (or third party IP used in the Company's business) or any
IP owned by Parent, the disclosure or delivery of any Company technology to
any third party, or any payment to any third party in excess of what would
have otherwise been payable.

performing services for the Company comply, and have at all times complied,
with all Privacy Laws and the Company's HIPAA certifications. The Company does
not process, and has not processed, any protected health information, as such

required by HIPAA to enter into business associate agreements. The Company has
at all times maintained reasonable and appropriate security policies and
measures for its products, the information technology assets used in its
business, and data processed in its business. There has been no accidental,

alteration, or other processing of, any such assets or any data maintained or
otherwise processed by or for the Company.

best efforts to (i) solicit such Stockholders' consent and to cause them 

to deliver their executed counterpart to the Stockholder Written Consent and
Joinder Agreement and (ii) cause the holders of Vested Company Options to
deliver their executed counterpart to the Joinder Agreement. The Company
covenants that the Information Statement will not contain any statement which
is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.

5.3 Reasonable Best Efforts to Close. Each of the parties hereto shall use
reasonable best efforts to take cause to be taken promptly all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective Transactions
as promptly as practicable, including by using reasonable best efforts to
satisfy the conditions set forth in Annex A. Each party hereto, at the request
of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and
do and perform such other acts as may be necessary, proper or advisable for
effecting completely the consummation of the Transactions. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each party agrees to (i) within five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof, make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ
or other applicable competition or merger control authorities, (iii) promptly
inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions and (iv)
if such party receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions,
then such party shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably practicable (and, in the case of the Company,
after consultation with Parent), an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. Nothing in this Agreement will require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent to sell, hold separate, license
or otherwise dispose of any assets or conduct their business in a specified
manner, or agree or proffer to sell, hold separate, license or otherwise
dispose of any assets or conduct their business in a specified manner, or
permit or agree to the sale, holding separate, licensing or other disposition
of, any assets of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of
Parent or the Company for any reason.

5.4 Access to Information. The Company shall afford Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during the period from the date hereof and
prior to the Closing to (a) all of the properties, Books and Records and
Contracts of the Company and the Subsidiaries, (b) all other information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, and (c) all current Employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries. The Company agrees to provide to Parent and its accountants,
counsel and other Representatives copies of internal financial statements
promptly upon request.

ARTICLE VI 
PRE-CLOSING TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

6.1 Pre-Closing Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing: (a) by mutual written agreement of
the Company and Parent; (b) by Parent if the Required Vote shall not have been
delivered to Parent within twenty four (24) hours after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement; (c) by Parent or the Company if the Closing Date
shall not have occurred prior to 11:59 PM Pacific time on December 31, 2019
(the "End Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 6.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose
action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and such action or
failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement; (d) by Parent or the
Company if any Legal Requirement shall be in effect which has the effect of
making the Merger illegal or otherwise prevents consummation of the Merger
(and in the case of an Order, such Order has become final and non-appealable);
(e) by Parent (so long as Parent is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement) if there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement
such that the conditions to Parent's obligation to close the transaction set
forth in Annex A would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or
inaccuracy, unless such breach inaccuracy is cured (if capable of cure) to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent within ten (10) days; or (f) by the Company
(so long as the Company is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in 

this Agreement) if there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent set forth in this
Agreement such that the conditions to the Company's obligation to close the
transaction set forth in Annex A would not be satisfied as of the time of such
breach or inaccuracy, unless such breach inaccuracy is cured (if capable of
cure) to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company within ten (10) days.

6.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 6.1, this Agreement shall become void and there shall be
no liability or obligation on the part of any party or their Representatives;
provided, however, that each party hereto shall remain liable for any willful
and intentional breaches of this Agreement, Related Agreements or in any
certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement prior to
its termination; provided further, that, the provisions of this Section 6.2
and the general provisions contained in Annex C (but excluding paragraph 7
thereof) shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of
this Agreement.



ARTICLE VII 
POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Related Indemnification
Claims. The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, and the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof
under this Agreement, shall survive until 11:59 p.m. California time on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date (the date of expiration of such period,
the "Expiration Date"); provided, however, that (a) each Fundamental
Representation and each Tax Representation, and the right to make
indemnification claims in respect thereof, shall survive until 11:59 p.m.,
California time, on the date that is thirty (30) days after the expiration of
all applicable underlying statutes of limitations governing the subject
matters addressed thereby (including all periods of extension and tolling);
provided, further, that all representations and warranties of the Company and
the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof under this
Agreement, shall survive beyond the survival periods specified above with
respect to any inaccuracy therein or breach thereof if a claim is timely made
in accordance with the terms hereunder prior to the expiration of the survival
period, in which case such representation and warranty and the right to make
indemnification claims in respect thereof shall survive as to such claim until
such claim has been finally resolved. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, the Related Agreements or
in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall terminate at the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing respective survival periods
and termination dates supersede any applicable statutes of limitations
(including 10 Del. C. Â§ 8106(a)) that may otherwise apply to such
representations and warranties and the right to make indemnification claims in
respect thereof under this Agreement.

7.2 Indemnification From and after the consummation of the Merger, subject to
the terms and limitations of this Article VII, the Indemnifying Parties shall
severally, but not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified
Parties, from and against all Losses paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by
the Indemnified Parties, resulting from or arising out of: (i) any breach of
or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement; provided, however, that in the event of any such breach or
inaccuracy, no effect will be given to any qualifications based on the word
"material" or similar phrases contained in such representation or warranty;
(ii) any inaccuracy in any information required to be set forth in the Pre-
Closing Statement, Statement of Specified Liabilities or Closing Payment
Spreadsheet including any failure to properly calculate any item required to
be contained therein; (iii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply
with any covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement
which is required to be performed prior to the Closing; (iv) any payment or
expense in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration
that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance
with this Agreement; and (v) any Fraud by or on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with the Transactions. 

(a) The Indemnifying Parties shall not have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Indemnified Parties with
respect to any Loss.

(b) Except in the case of Fraud committed by an Indemnifying Party or of which
an Indemnifying Party had knowledge, the indemnification rights set forth in
this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Parties from and after the Effective Time for any claims arising under this
Agreement; provided, however, that this Section 7.2(c) shall not be deemed a
waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief.
Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any party to a Related
Agreement to pursue remedies under such Related Agreement against the other
parties thereto.

7.3 Limitations on Indemnification, Threshold. Except in the case of Fraud
committed by an Indemnifying Party or of which an Indemnifying Party had
knowledge, the Indemnified Parties, as a group, may not recover any Losses
pursuant to an indemnification claim under Section 7.2(a)(i) (other than with
respect to a breach of a Fundamental Representation or Tax Representation)
unless and until the Indemnified Parties, as a group, shall have paid,
incurred, suffered or sustained $3,225,000 in Losses in the aggregate in
respect of indemnification claims under Section 7.2(a)(i) (the "Threshold
Amount"), in which case Parent shall be entitled to recover all Losses so
identified; provided, however, that indemnification claims under Section
7.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to a breach of a Fundamental Representation
or Tax Representation) in amounts below $100,000 (a "De Minimis Amount") shall
not be recoverable and shall not count towards the Threshold Amount (it being
understood that the dollar value of Losses resulting from "individual"
occurrences, events or circumstances that relate to or result from the same
cause or circumstance will be aggregated for purposes of the De Minimis
Amount).

(a) Maximum Liability.

(i) Except as specifically set forth in this Article VII, (A) the maximum
amount that an Indemnified Party may recover for Losses pursuant to the
indemnity set forth in Section 7.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to a breach
of a Fundamental Representation or a Tax Representation) shall be limited to
an amount equal to the Escrow Amount, and (B) the maximum amount that an
Indemnified Party may recover for Losses pursuant to the indemnity set forth
in Section 7.2(a)(i) in respect of breaches of Fundamental Representations and
Tax Representations and Section 7.2(a)(ii)-(iv) shall be limited to an amount
equal to the Total Consideration.

(ii) The Indemnified Parties' first source of recovery for indemnification
claims under Section 7.2(a) shall be against the Escrow Fund, but if the
Escrow Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy an indemnification claim under
Section 7.2, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover such excess
portion of such Losses (an "Excess Loss") directly from the Indemnifying
Parties, and each Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article VII, be liable, severally and not jointly, solely for
its, his or her Pro Rata Portion of the Excess Losses.

(iii) The liability of each Indemnifying Party for indemnification claims
under this Agreement shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a dollar amount
equal to the portion of the Total Consideration received by such Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this
Article VII shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party in connection
with a claim based on Fraud committed by an Indemnifying Party or of which an
Indemnifying Party had knowledge.

(b) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification or any other
remedy under this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation or
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired). The waiver of any condition
will not affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy under this
Agreement. Other than with respect to any claim for fraud, no Indemnified
Party shall be required to show reliance in order for such Indemnified Party
to be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

7.4 Indemnification Claim Procedures If an Indemnified Party wishes to make an
indemnification claim under this Article VII, such Indemnified Party shall
deliver a written notice (an "Indemnification Claim 

Notice") to the Stockholder Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent)
(or for claims directly against an Indemnifying Party, to such Indemnifying
Party) (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain
Losses, and (ii) to the extent known, specifying in reasonable detail the
nature of such Losses. Parent may update an Indemnification Claim Notice from
time to time to reflect any new information with respect to the claim. Each
Indemnification Notice shall be promptly delivered to the Stockholder
Representative; provided, that any delay or failure to give such notice will
not waive any rights of the Indemnified Party or relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations with respect thereto except to the
extent the rights of the Indemnifying Party are actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure or delay.

(a) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person (other than a
party to this Agreement) of any Action with respect to which the Indemnifying
Parties may become obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article VII (each, a "Third Party Action"), the Stockholder
Representative shall (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) have the right to
participate in (at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties), but not to
control, the defense of such Third Party Action. The Indemnified Parties may
settle a Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder Representative; provided, that such settled amount shall not be
determinative of the amount of Losses indemnifiable pursuant to this Article
VII unless the Stockholder Representative consents to such settlement (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(b) If the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
shall not object in writing within the forty-five (45) day period after
receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by delivery of a written notice of
an objection containing a reasonably detailed description of the facts and
circumstances supporting such objection (an "Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice"), such failure to so object shall mean for all purposes that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set
forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice. In such event the Escrow Agent
shall as promptly as practicable release from the Escrow Fund an amount of
cash equal to the Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice.

(c) In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall deliver an
Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(b), the
Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) and Parent
may attempt to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to
such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties (a "Resolution Memorandum"). In such event, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall, as promptly as practicable, deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent who shall, subject to Section 7.4(f), promptly
release from the Escrow Fund the amount of cash set forth in the Resolution
Memorandum. Should the amount held in the Escrow Fund, if any, be insufficient
to satisfy in whole the amount owed to an Indemnified Party in accordance with
such memorandum and this Agreement, then each Indemnifying Party shall
promptly pay to the Indemnified Party such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata
Portion of such shortfall as though such shortfall was an Excess Loss.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached prior to forty-five (45) days after
delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection Notice, either Parent or the
Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration of the matter unless the
amount of the Loss that is at issue is then subject of a pending litigation
with a third party. Such arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator
mutually agreeable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative. In the event
that, within thirty (30) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative cannot mutually agree on one
arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) days after the end of such thirty (30)
day period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each select one
independent arbitrator who shall select a third independent arbitrator.

(e) Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County, California,
under the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS ("JAMS"). The
arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration
shall be paid. The arbitrator(s) shall establish procedures designed to reduce
the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity to
discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall rule 

upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to
impose sanctions to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity,
should the arbitrator(s) determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without
substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator(s) as to the
validity and amount of any claim in such Indemnification Claim Notice shall be
final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the
Indemnifying Parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by
written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award,
judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). Within thirty (30)
days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by Parent to the
Indemnifying Parties or by the Indemnifying Parties to Parent, such person(s)
shall make the payment to such other person(s), including by making joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent for any distributions out of the
Escrow Fund, if applicable. Judgment upon any award rendered by the
arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The forgoing
arbitration provision shall apply to any dispute among the Indemnifying
Parties or any Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties under this
Article VII, whether relating to claims to recover funds from the Escrow Fund.

(f) On the tenth (10th) Business Day following the Expiration Date, Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to (i) retain an
amount, if any, equal to the amount of any claims for indemnification asserted
in an Indemnification Claim Notice delivered in accordance with Section 7.4
prior to the Expiration Date but which are not yet resolved or for which
payment has not yet been made (an "Unresolved Claim") and (ii) release any
remaining Escrow Amount net of such Unresolved Claims to (x) the Paying Agent
(in respect of the portion payable to Stockholders and holders of Vested
Company Options who are not able to be paid via the Surviving Corporation's
payroll) and (y) Parent (in respect of the portion payable to holders of
Vested Company Options who are able to be paid via the Surviving Corporation's
payroll), and Parent shall promptly distribute such amount to the Surviving
Corporation's payroll. The amount of the Escrow Amount retained for each
Unresolved Claim shall be released (to the extent not utilized to indemnify
any Indemnified Party) by the Escrow Agent to (x) the Paying Agent (in respect
of the portion payable to Stockholders and holders of Vested Company Options
who are not able to be paid via the Surviving Corporation's payroll) and (y)
Parent (in respect of the portion payable to holders of Vested Company Options
who are able to be paid via the Surviving Corporation's payroll), and Parent
shall promptly distribute such amount to the Surviving Corporation's payroll
upon the resolution of such Unresolved Claim in accordance with this Article
VII.

7.5 Stockholder Representative The rights and obligations of the Stockholder
Representative as between him and the Indemnifying Parties shall be as
provided in this Section 7.5. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger by the Stockholders by the Required Vote, and the
execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement and/or a Stockholder Written
Consent, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to have agreed to
appoint Asaf Evenhaim as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder
Representative for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties to: (i) to
deliver and receive notices or communications (including in respect of
indemnification claims) required or permitted to be delivered to or received
by the Indemnifying Parties or any of them pursuant to this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement; (ii) to negotiate, execute and deliver any waivers, consents
or amendments under or to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (iii) to
authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of any claims under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (iv)
to object to any claims or demands under this Agreement from Parent or the
Indemnified Parties or the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement: (v) to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to any claims under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (vi) to
assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to, any claim against any Indemnifying Party or by any such
Indemnifying against a party to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Indemnifying Party, in each
case relating to this Agreement or the Transactions; (vii) to hold the
Representative Expense Amount on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, to retain
and to pay legal counsel and other professionals in connection with any and
all matters referred to herein or relating hereto, and to make such payments
from the Representative Expense Amount as the Stockholder Representative deems
necessary or appropriate following the Merger; and (viii) to 

take all other actions that are either (x) necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of any of
the foregoing or (y) mandated or permitted by the terms of this Agreement or
any applicable Related Agreement. After the Closing, notices or communications
to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from
the Indemnifying Parties. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of
this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof shall constitute a decision of the
Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent, Parent and each of
their respective Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) may rely
upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent, Parent, the Paying Agent and each of
their respective Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) are hereby
relieved from any liability to any Person (including the Indemnifying Parties)
for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative
shall have no responsibility or liability of any kind or nature whatsoever to
the Indemnifying Parties or any of them for the performance by the Stockholder
Representative of any duty required or permitted pursuant to this Section 7.5
other than as a result of fraud or willful misconduct on the part of the
Stockholder Representative, as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction, and each of the Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify and hold
harmless and defend the Stockholder Representative against all claims, losses
and damages of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of or in connection
with the Stockholder Representative's performance of any duty required or
permitted pursuant to this Section 7.5, except in the case of the Stockholder
Representative's fraud or willful misconduct, as finally determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction. In the event of the death, disability or
resignation of Asaf Evenhaim as the Stockholder Representative, a replacement
Stockholder Representative shall be appointed by the holders of a majority
interest of the Escrow Fund. As soon as reasonably determined by the
Stockholder Representative that the Representative Expense Fund (or any
portion thereof) is no longer required to be withheld, the Stockholder
Representative shall distribute the remaining Representative Expense Fund (if
any) to Parent, and promptly thereafter, Parent shall distribute such amount
to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portions via distributions to (i) the Paying Agent (in respect of the portion
of the Representative Expense Fund payable to Stockholders and holders of
Vested Company Options who are not able to be paid via the Surviving
Corporation's payroll) and (ii) the Surviving Corporation's payroll (in
respect of the portion of the Representative Expense Fund payable to holders
of Vested Company Options who are able to be paid via the Surviving
Corporation's payroll).
