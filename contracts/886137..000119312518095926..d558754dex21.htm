(d) _Changes to Capital Stock_. Without limiting the other provisions of this

shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, share split
or combination, split-up, exchange or readjustment of Company Common Shares,
any issuance of Company Preferred Shares or Company Common Shares in
connection with the exercise of any rights under the Rights Agreement
(whether or not the Company has complied with its obligations under this
Agreement with respect to the Rights Agreement, but without prejudice to the
rights and remedies of Parent for any non-compliance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder with respect thereto), or any share dividend on Company
Preferred Shares or Company Common Shares with a record date during such

duplication, to proportionally reflect such change (it being understood and
agreed that this sentence shall not be construed to permit the Company to take
any action that is prohibited by  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ or the other terms of

Section 2.7 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select an
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates for the Merger Consideration. Parent will make available to the
Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.6(c)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and shall engage the Exchange Agent
pursuant to a paying agent agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to
send to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time)
of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to each
Certificate shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificate to the
Exchange Agent, and which letter of transmittal shall be in customary form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree)
and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificate to the
Exchange Agent in exchange for the total amount of Merger Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. Each holder of Company Common Shares that have
been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or, if such shares are held
in book entry form, upon entry through a book entry transfer agent of the
surrender of such shares on a book entry account statement, as evidenced by an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent), together with a properly completed
letter of transmittal (and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the instructions thereto) will be entitled to receive from the Exchange
Agent a cash amount (payable by check or otherwise) equal to the aggregate
Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to this _ARTICLE II_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
shall be paid to the 

 



19 ##### Table of Contents

  

 holders of any unsurrendered Certificates. Until so surrendered, each
Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each Company Common Share
formerly represented thereby. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ , each Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled.

 

(c) _Certificate Holder_. If payment of any Merger Consideration is to be
made to any Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment
thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes
required as a result of such payment in the name of a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights; Transfer Books_. All Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE II_ upon conversion of any
Company Common Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares. After the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of any Company Common Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificates formerly representing Company Common Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE II_.

 

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. Until disbursed to the holders of Company
Common Shares that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ , the Paying Agent shall
invest, all cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America as to principal and
interest, or money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
investment; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time, any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to holders of Certificates shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, together with all interest and other earnings with respect thereto.
Thereafter, any holder of Company Common Shares who has not theretofore
complied with this _ARTICLE II_ shall (subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(g)_)
look only to Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, which shall act as the
Exchange Agent, as general creditors thereof with respect to any claim for
Merger Consideration that may be payable (without interest) upon surrender of
any Certificate, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, subject to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws.

 



20 ##### Table of Contents

  

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official to the extent required by any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which the total Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise irrevocably
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, such cash in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact,
reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent, by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in respect
of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration with respect to each Company Common Share formerly represented
by such Certificate.

 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of
Company Common Shares or any holder of Company Equity Awards (or with respect
to any other amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_) pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any other
provision of applicable United States federal, state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be (i) remitted by Parent
and (ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holders of the Company Common Shares or holders of Company Equity Awards (or

in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Directors of the Company shall take or cause to be taken all actions as may be
required to cause each Company Stock Option granted under the Company
Incentive Plan that is outstanding and remains unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable), including
Company Stock Options held by any current or former member of the Board, to at
the Effective Time, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled or terminated; (ii) Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holder of such Company Stock
Option, whether vested or unvested, an amount in cash (without interest) in
respect thereof equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Shares
underlying such Company Stock Option and (y) the number of Company Common
Shares subject thereto (such payment, if any, to be net of applicable
withholding taxes and

 



21 ##### Table of Contents

  

 rounded down to the nearest whole cent); and (iii) all Company Stock Options
with an exercise price per share of Company Common Shares equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled or terminated at the
Effective Time and the holders of such Company Stock Options will not have any
right to receive any consideration in respect thereof. The Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) make
all payments in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ as soon as
practicable but in any event no later than the first regular payroll date of
the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time. In addition, the Company
shall use Reasonable Best Efforts to obtain consents from current employees of
the Company holding Company Stock Options acknowledging the treatment of
Company Stock Options described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement (and, in any event, prior to the Closing), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall take all actions as may be required to provide
that at the Effective Time, each award of Company Restricted Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested and free of any
forfeiture restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time, whereupon the
Company Common Shares represented thereby (net of any Company Common Shares
or corresponding cash withheld to cover applicable withholding taxes) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration per Company
Common Share in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_.

 

(c) _ ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required so that (i) the ESPP is terminated immediately after the next
"Purchase Date" (as defined in the ESPP) (the " _Final Purchase Date_ ") to
occur following the date of this Agreement, (ii) all future offerings that
would otherwise commence under the ESPP following the Final Purchase Date
shall be suspended, and (iv) all further payroll deductions under the ESPP
shall cease effective as of the Final Purchase Date. On the Final Purchase
Date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the
ESPP to each participants payroll withholding account under the ESPP to the
purchase of whole Company Common Shares in accordance with the terms of the
ESPP, which Company Common Shares shall be treated in the manner described in
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_.

 

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company and the
Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt any resolutions and take any
actions which are necessary to (i) effectuate the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 2.8_ and (ii) cause the Company Incentive Plan to terminate at the
Effective Time. The Company shall provide to Parent a true, correct and
complete copy of any such resolutions or actions.

(e) _No Right to Acquire Shares_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Company Common Shares or
other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement
of a Company Equity Award or the ESPP following the Effective Time, except to
the extent exercised prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall assume any Company Stock
Options.

failure of any payment to such disqualified individual to be deductible under
Section 280G of the Code or (vi) result in the payment of any amount that

_Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(i)_. Any breach by any director, officer, employee or
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of this _Section_ __

(b) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ or in any other provision of this Agreement, in
the event that the Company receives, after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, a bona
fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal which did not result from a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ (other than, individually or in the
aggregate, insignificant breaches) and which the Board of Directors of the

breach to Parent after the Company obtains Knowledge of such breach and (ii)
take such action reasonably requested by Parent to seek to cure such breach
within three (3) Business Days of the date on which the Company receives such

regarding, and the status of, any such Alternative Transaction Proposal
(including any amendments thereto), inquiries or requests, including any
changes in the Companys intentions as previously notified (including by
providing copies of any additional materials relating thereto) and (ii) all
material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is made available to the Person or group of Persons making
such Alternative Transaction Proposal (or any of their advisors or other
representatives) which was not previously made available to Parent and Merger
Sub. It is understood and agreed that the Companys obligations under this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_ shall be limited by the information available to the
Company in respect of such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

 

(d) _No Change of Recommendation; Other Prohibitions_. The Board of Directors
of the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, (i)(A) withdraw or qualify
(or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) or publicly propose or

 agreement, arrangement or understanding (A) constituting, or relating to,
any Alternative Transaction Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
to the extent permitted by, and in accordance with, the proviso at the end of
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_) or (B) requiring it (or that would by its terms
require it) to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions.

(e) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_ or in any other provision of this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, at no time after obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval), solely in response to a Superior Proposal that is made and is not
withdrawn (and that continues to be a Superior Proposal), the Board of
Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
may authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.1(c)(i)_ in order to enter into a definitive written agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Agreement_ ") if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and an independent financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that, in light of such Superior
Proposal, the failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to
terminate this Agreement and enter into a Superior Proposal Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal would be a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , that all of the following conditions are
met:

(i) Prior to making any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminating this Agreement, (w) the Company shall give Parent written notice
of the action(s) proposed to be taken by the Board of Directors of the
Company, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the reasons for such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination, and (in the case of a
Superior Proposal) shall also identify the Person or group of Persons making
such Superior Proposal and attach the latest draft of the proposed Superior
Proposal Agreement and all other related documents, (x) during the three (3)
Business Day period following its receipt of such notice (it being understood
and agreed that, for the purpose of this clause (x), "business day" means a
full day of normal business hours in Greenwich Mean Time), Parent shall have
the right to make a bona fide offer (a " _Parent Offer_ ") to the Company in
response to the action(s) proposed to be taken by the Board of Directors of
the Company, and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
and each of the directors, officers, employees and Representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives
in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) such adjustments
proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
Merger may be effected, (y) if Parent makes a Parent Offer within such three
(3) Business Day (it being understood and agreed that, for the purpose of
this clause (y), "business day" means a full day of normal business hours in
Greenwich Mean Time), the Board of Directors of the Company shall consider
such Parent Offer in good faith and, if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside
counsel and an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that such Parent Offer would render the failure by the Board of
Directors of the Company to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
no longer a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (in the
case of a Superior Proposal) would render such Superior Proposal no longer a
Superior Proposal (taking into account, to the extent the Board of Directors
of the Company deems relevant, all legal,

 



57 ##### Table of Contents

  

 financial, regulatory, financing, conditionality, timing and other aspects
of such Parent Offer, including the Person or group of Persons (as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making the Superior Proposal, the
anticipated prospects of completion, any termination fee and expense
reimbursement provisions, any shareholder litigation in connection with the
Merger or any other factor set forth in the IBCL), the Company shall agree in
writing to all adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
are necessary to reflect such Parent Offer and the Companys notice of the
proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change or the termination of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be rescinded and of no further force and effect,
and (z) in the event of any material revisions to any Superior Proposal
(including any change in purchase price), the Company shall deliver a new
written notice to Parent and comply with the other requirements of this
clause (i) with respect to such revised Superior Proposal (and Parent shall
have the right to submit a new or revised Parent Offer with respect thereto);
_provided,_ _that_ , in any such case, all references above in this clause
(i) to three (3) Business Days shall instead be deemed to be two (2) Business
Days (it being understood and agreed that, for the purpose of this proviso,
"business day" means a full day of normal business hours in Greenwich Mean
Time);

(ii) The Company shall have complied with  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ in all
respects (other than, individually or in the aggregate, insignificant
breaches); and

 

(iii) Prior to or simultaneous with any termination of this Agreement under
Section 7.1(c)(i), the Company shall have paid the Company Termination Fee to
Parent.

(f) _Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the
Company Shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look
and listen" communication to the Company Shareholders of the nature
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any action taken or disclosure made under this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(f)_
shall not limit or modify the effect that any such action or disclosure may
have under any other provision of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
if any disclosure or other action pursuant to clause (i) of this _Section_ __
_ 5.2(f)_ includes or has the substantive effect of a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, it shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change for all purposes under this Agreement. A "stop, look and
listen" communication, in and of itself, or a factually accurate public
statement that describes the Companys receipt of an Alternative Transaction
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall be
deemed not a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(g) _Exception for Intervening Events_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that (i) an Intervening Event has
occurred and (ii) the failure to take such action would be a violation of its
fiduciary duties, the Board of Directors may, within five (5) Business Days
after the Intervening Event became known to the Companys Board of Directors
and solely in response to such Intervening Event, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

(i) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty (20) Business
Days) following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall use Reasonable
Best Efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement

counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on (i) any written
response to such comments, requests or other communications from the SEC or
its staff and (ii) any proposed amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement (whether in response to such comments, requests or communications
from the SEC or its staff, or otherwise), shall incorporate all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with respect
thereto and shall not file any version of any such written response or
proposed amendment of supplement without the prior written consent of Parent,
Merger Sub or their counsel (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

(iv) Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that none of the information
supplied by it or on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement and the Parent Shareholder Circular will, at the date the
Proxy Statement or the Parent Shareholder Circular, respectively, is
first mailed to the Company Shareholders or the Parent Shareholders,
respectively, and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting or the
Parent Shareholders Meeting, respectively, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 

(v) If at any time prior to the approval of this Agreement by the Company
Shareholders, any information relating to the Company or any of its
Affiliates, directors or officers is discovered by the Company, or any
information relating to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers is discovered by Parent, and such
information is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties and (subject to the comment and review procedures set

Company (x) determines at any time that this Agreement, the Merger or the
other Transactions are no longer advisable, (y) recommends that the Company
Shareholders reject this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions or
(z) any Company Adverse Recommendation Change occurs; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting,

necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment (as determined
by the Company in good faith after consultation with its outside counsel) is
provided to the Company Shareholders in advance of a vote on the approval of
this Agreement or (ii) if, as of the time for which the Company Shareholders
Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient Company Common Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such meeting and, in any such case (clause (i) or

circumstance. The Company shall, except to the extent that its Board of
Directors is expressly permitted to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to (and in compliance with) _Section_ __ _ 5.2(e)_ (which
shall not, in any event, affect the Companys obligation to hold the Company

limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Companys obligations pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ (including its obligation to hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting at which this Agreement shall be submitted to the
Company Shareholders for approval as aforesaid) shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Alternative Transaction Proposal unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(i)_. 

(c) Except to the extent expressly permitted to make a Company Adverse

5.2(e)_, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend that the
Company Shareholders vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement at the

(d) As promptly as practicable (and in any event, within fifteen (15) Business
Days after the filing of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ending 2018), Parent shall use Reasonable Best Efforts to prepare
a copy of the Parent Shareholder Circular for submission to the UKLA.
Parent shall cause the Parent Shareholder Circular to comply in all material
respects with the Companies Act, the FSMA, the UK Listing Rules, the UK
Prospectus Rules and all other applicable Laws. The Company shall promptly
provide all such information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, its
Affiliates and its and their business, officers and directors to Parent, and
promptly provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or the UKLA in connection with the preparation, verification, filing
and distribution of the Parent Shareholder Circular. Parent will respond
promptly to, and the Company will provide reasonable assistance to Parent in
responding promptly to, any comments by the UKLA in connection with
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Parent Shareholder Circular,
whether in connection with the aforementioned filing of the Parent Shareholder
Circular or subsequent filings of it. No filing of, amendment or supplement
to, the Parent Shareholder Circular will be made by Parent without providing
the Company and its counsel the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon and giving due consideration to such comments. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent may amend or supplement the Parent
Shareholder Circular. If at any time prior to the Parent Shareholder Meeting
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which, in the opinion of Parent, should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Parent Shareholder Circular so that such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and Parent shall
prepare an

(e) Parent shall use Reasonable Best Efforts to cause the mailing of the
Parent Shareholder Circular to the Parent Shareholders (or to such of them as
is required by the Parent Articles) to occur as soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement. Parent shall, as soon as practicable (and in any
event, within 25 Business Days after the filing of the Companys Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending 2018) duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold, a general meeting of its shareholders (the " _Parent
Shareholders  Meeting_") in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent
Articles for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval,
regardless of whether the Board of Directors of Parent (x) determines at any
time that this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions are no longer
advisable, (y) recommends that Parents shareholders reject this Agreement,
the Merger or the other Transactions or (z) makes any other adverse change to
its recommendations in favor of this Agreement, the Merger or the
Transactions. Parent shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to obtain the

after consultation with the Company, Parent may adjourn or postpone the
Parent Shareholders Meeting if (and solely to the extent and for the minimum
duration permitted by the Parent Articles and reasonably necessary to ensure
that): (i) any supplement or amendment to the Parent Shareholder
Circular required under the Companies Act, the FSMA, the UK Listing Rules,
the UK Prospectus Rules and all other applicable Laws is timely provided to
the Parent Shareholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Parent Shareholders Meeting or (ii) as of the time for which the Parent
Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of
capital stock of Parent entitled to vote at the Parent Shareholders Meeting
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business to be conducted at the Parent Shareholders Meeting
and to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval. Without limiting the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of Parent may withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner
adverse to the Company) or publicly propose or resolve to withdraw or qualify
(or amend or modify in a manner adverse to the Company) its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, or
its declaration that the Merger promotes the success of Parent for the benefit
of its members as a whole, if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in
good faith (after consultation with its legal counsel and an independent
financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation) that the failure
to effect such withdrawal, qualification, amendment or modification would be a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Neither Parent nor its
Board of Directors may take any action to rescind the Parent Shareholder
Approval after it is obtained.

not be required to cause any of their Subsidiaries to) make any payments or
incur any other Liabilities (including becoming a guarantor of any Company

amendatory effect. The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ with respect to the Company Employees

7.1(d)(ii)_, and (iii) concurrently with the consummation of the Alternative
Transaction Proposal described in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)(iii)_ (even if such

same day funds, (i) in the case of termination by the Company as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(i)_, contemporaneously with such termination (if Parent

_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(i)_) and, if such documentation has not then been
provided to the Company, promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days) after such documentation is provided and (ii) in the case
of termination by Parent as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(i)_, promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after Parent provides to the
Company the documentation referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(i)_. Except
to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall not withhold any
withholding taxes from any payment made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_.

 

(d) _Company Acknowledgement_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are integral parts of the
Merger and the other Transactions, and that without these agreements, Parent
and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement and that the
Companys obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are not subject to, or
conditioned upon, any approval of this Agreement by the Company Shareholders.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay any amount due pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the Company shall pay to Parent all costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in
connection with enforcing this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, together with interest
on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment. The parties further acknowledge that the Company Termination Fee
shall not constitute a penalty but is liquidated

 damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties
acknowledge that, other than in the case of Fraud or with respect to
liabilities or damages arising out of a willful material breach of any
provision of this Agreement, the right to receive the Company Termination Fee
and/or the Expense Reimbursement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_
or _(b)_ (respectively) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent or
Merger Sub if this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the termination
provisions of Section 7.1 referenced in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _(b)_
(respectively); but it shall not limit or otherwise affect Parents right to
specific performance as provided in Section 8.12.

of a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub).

by a written instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be

the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the Transactions are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall, prior to termination in accordance with _ARTICLE VII_ , be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that it
shall not oppose the granting of any such relief and (ii) hereby irrevocably
waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection
with any such relief (it is understood that clause (i) of this sentence is
not intended to, and shall not, preclude any party hereto from litigating on
the merits the substantive claim to which such remedy relates).

 

(b) The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.12_, no party shall in any respect waive their
rights to seek any other form of relief that may be available to them under
this Agreement (including damages) in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section_
__ _ 8.12_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing
set forth in this Agreement shall require any party to institute any Action
for (or limit any partys right to institute any Action for) specific
performance under this _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ prior or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under _ARTICLE VII_ or pursuing any other
form of relief referred to in the preceding clause (i).

Section 8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT AND MERGER

registered office and initial registered agent of the Corporation shall be as
specified in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation (the
"Articles of Incorporation"), but such registered office and registered agent
may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors in the manner
provided by law and the registered office need not be identical to the
principal office of the Corporation.

_Section 1.3_ _Principal Office and Other Offices_. The principal office
of the Corporation shall be located at any place, within or without the State
of Indiana, as designated in the Corporations most current biennial report

 _ARTICLE 2_

 

 _Shares_

_ Section_ __ _ 2.1_ _Certificates for Shares_.

2.1.1 _Form of Certificate_. Certificates representing shares of the
Corporation ("share certificates") shall be in such form as the Board of
Directors may prescribe from time to time, provided that each share
certificate shall comply with all applicable requirements of IC 23-1-26-6(b),
(c) and (d). In addition each share certificate shall include such notations,
legends or statements as may be required by (a) IC 23-1-26-8 in order to make
restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares
enforceable against holders of the shares represented by the share certificate
and transferees of such holder, and (b) federal and Indiana securities laws.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.1.1 and any other
provision of these Bylaws to the contrary, the Board of Directors may adopt a
system of issuance, recordation and transfer of the Corporations shares by
electronic or other means not involving the issuance of
certificates, provided that any such system shall comply with the Indiana
Business Corporation Law.

 



1 ##### Table of Contents

  

2.1.2 _Officer Signatures_. Every share certificate shall be signed in the
name of the Corporation by the President and the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary. Any and all of the signatures on the certificate may be by
facsimile.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ _Transfer of Shares_. When a share certificate, duly
endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment,
authority to transfer and any other transfer documentation required by law or
by agreement, is surrendered to the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or transfer
agent of the Corporation, the Corporation shall cause a new share certificate
to be issued to the person(s) entitled thereto, shall cancel the surrendered
share certificate and shall record the transaction upon its books.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ _Lost or Destroyed Certificates_. A new share
certificate may be issued without the surrender and cancellation of a prior
share certificate that is lost, apparently destroyed or wrongfully taken when
each of the following conditions are met: (a) the request for the issuance of
a new share certificate is made within a reasonable time after the owner of
the prior share certificate has notice of its loss, destruction or theft; (b)
such request is received by the Corporation prior to its receipt of notice
that the prior share certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser;
and (c) the owner of the prior share certificate gives an indemnity bond or
other adequate security sufficient in the judgment of the Board of Directors
to indemnify the Corporation against any claim, expense or liability that
might result from the issuance of a new share certificate.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ _Transfer Agent and Registrars_. The Board of Directors
may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more

 _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ _Equitable Interests Need Not Be Recognized_. The
Corporation and its officers and other representatives and agents shall be
entitled to treat the holder of record of any shares of the Corporation as the
absolute owner and holder of those shares for all purposes, and, accordingly,
shall not be obligated to recognize any legal, equitable or other claim to or
interest in those shares on the part of any other person(s), whether or not
any notice (express, implied or otherwise) of such other claim or interest has
been given to the Corporation (and/or any of its officers or other
representatives or agents), except as expressly provided to the contrary by
applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws.

fiscal year on the exact date and at the time as shall be fixed by the Board
of Directors. At each annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect a Board of
Directors and transact such other business as properly may be brought before
the meeting. The failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders at the
time fixed by the Board of Directors does not affect the validity of any
corporate action.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ _Special Meetings_

 

3.2.1 _Authorization to Call Special Meetings_. The President, the Board of
Directors, any member of the Board of Directors, or the holder(s) of at least

at any time for the purpose of taking any action described in the meeting
notice which is permitted to be taken by the shareholders under the Indiana
Business Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation and these Bylaws.

 

3.2.2 _Procedure for Calling Special Meetings_. If a special meeting of

and describing the purpose or purposes for which the special meeting is to be

more shareholders is not given to shareholders within sixty days after the

a valid demand for the special meeting may apply for a court ordered meeting
as provided in IC 23-1-29-3.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ _Place of Meetings_. All annual and special meetings
of shareholders of the Corporation shall be held at such place, within or

Bylaws before or after the date and time stated in the notice. The waiver must
be in writing, signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice, and delivered
to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate
records. In addition, a shareholders attendance at a meeting waives
objections to the extent and in the manner provided by IC 23-1-29-6.

 

3.4.5 _Adjourned Meetings_. If any shareholder meeting is adjourned to a
different date, time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time
or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before
adjournment, except in the case where a new record date for the adjourned
meeting is, or must be, fixed, in which event notice of the adjourned meeting
must be given pursuant to the requirements of this Section 3.4 to those
persons who are shareholders entitled to notice as of the new record date. The
Corporation may transact at the adjourned meeting any business which might
have been transacted at the original meeting.

notice of, or to vote at, any annual or special meeting of shareholders,
shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting or to take any other action,
shareholders entitled to receive payment of any distribution or dividend, or
in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose,
the Board of Directors may fix a future date as the record date. Such record
date shall not be more than seventy days before the meeting or

fixed by the Board of Directors for the determination of shareholders entitled
to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of shareholders, shareholders entitled

Directors authorizes the share dividend;

(e) with respect to actions taken in writing without a meeting pursuant to
Section 3.7 of these Bylaws, the first date a signed written consent is

shall be the day the resolution of the Board of Directors taking the prior
action was adopted; and

 

(f) with respect to a distribution to shareholders (other than one involving a
repurchase or reacquisition of shares), the date the Board of Directors
authorizes the distribution.

When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting
of shareholders has been made as provided in this Section 3.4.6, such
determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof unless the Board of
Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is
adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty days after the date fixed
for the original meeting.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ _Voting at Meetings_.

 

3.5.1 _Voting Rights_. Subject to the provisions of the Indiana Business
Corporation Law and these Bylaws, only persons in whose names shares entitled
to vote stand on the share records of the Corporation on the record date shall
be entitled to vote at annual and special meetings of the shareholders. Except
as otherwise provided by the Indiana Business Corporation Law or by the
provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, at each annual and special
meeting of the shareholders, each outstanding share of the Corporation
standing in the shareholders name on the books of the Corporation shall be
entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at the meeting. If a
quorum exists, action on a matter (other than the election of directors) is
approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed votes cast opposing the
action, unless the Articles of Incorporation or the Indiana Business
Corporation Law require a greater number of affirmative votes. Unless
otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, members of the Board of
Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares

 



6 ##### Table of Contents

  

 entitled to vote in the election at the meeting of shareholders at which a
quorum is present. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation,
shareholders do not have the right to cumulate their votes for directors. If
the Articles of Incorporation or the Indiana Business Corporation Law provide
for voting by a single voting group on a matter, any action on that matter is
taken when voted upon by that voting group. Redeemable shares are not
entitled to vote after notice of redemption is mailed to the shareholders and
a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank, trust
company or other financial institution under an irrevocable obligation to
pay the shareholders the redemption price on surrender of the shares.

3.5.2 _Voting By Proxy_. A shareholder is entitled to vote either in person
or by a proxy that conforms to the requirements of IC 23-1-30-3 and is
received, at or before the meeting, by the Secretary or other person
authorized to tabulate votes. The attendance or the vote at any meeting of a
proxy of any shareholder so appointed shall for all purposes be considered as
the attendance or vote in person of such shareholder. The appointment of a
proxy shall be valid for eleven months from the date of its execution, unless
a shorter or longer period is expressly provided in the appointment. Each
appointment of a proxy shall be revocable by the shareholder unless it
conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled
with an interest as provided in IC 23-1-30-3.

 3.5.3 _Voice Voting; Written Ballot_. Voting at any meeting of shareholders
may be by voice vote or by written ballot, except that, in any election of
directors, voting must be by written ballot if voting by written ballot is
requested by any shareholder entitled to vote.

3.5.4 _Quorum_. At each annual or special meeting of shareholders, a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast on any matter at the meeting,
represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for action on
that matter. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is
deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for
any adjournment of that meeting, unless a new record date is or must be set
for the adjourned meeting. If a quorum is not present or represented at any
annual or special meeting of the shareholders, the meeting may be adjourned
by majority vote of the shares entitled to vote which are present, either in
person or by proxy, until such time as the requisite number of voting shares
constituting a quorum is present. If, after adjournment, a new record date is
set for the adjourned meeting, the existence of a quorum shall be redetermined
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.5.4.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ _List of Shareholders_. After fixing a record date for
a meeting of shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the share
transfer book of the Corporation shall prepare, in accordance with
IC 23-1-30-1, a list of the shareholders of the Corporation entitled to
notice of the meeting. Such list shall, subject to I.C. 23-1-52-2(c), be
available for inspection and copying by any record shareholder (or his or her
agent or attorney authorized in writing) during regular business hours and at
such shareholders expense, beginning five business days before the date of
the meeting for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting
and any adjournment of the meeting, at the Corporations principal office or
at a place

 



7 ##### Table of Contents

  

 identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held.
The original or duplicate share register or transfer book shall be the only
evidence as to the persons who are entitled as shareholders to examine such
list, the share ledger or transfer book, or to vote at such meeting.

_ Section_ __ _ 3.7_ _Action by Written Consent_. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders may
be taken without a meeting, and without prior notice, if consents in writing
setting forth the action taken and bearing the date of signature of the
shareholder(s) signing the consent are (a) signed by the holders of
outstanding shares having at least the minimum number of votes that would be
required to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote on the action were present and voted, and (b) delivered to
the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate
records. Such consent has the effect of a vote taken at a meeting, may be
described as a vote in any document and shall be effective when written
consents signed by sufficient shareholders to take the action are delivered to
the Corporation, unless the consent specifies a different prior or subsequent
effective date. The Corporation shall provide notice with respect to any
action taken by consent of voting shareholders to nonvoting and/or
nonconsenting shareholders to the extent and in the manner required by IC
23-1-29-4(e) and (f).

 

 _Section_ __ _ 3.8_ _Meeting by Telephone or Similar Communications
Equipment_. Any or all shareholders may participate in any annual or special
meeting of shareholders by, or through the use of, conference telephone or any
other means of communication by which all shareholders participating may
simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A shareholder
participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at
the meeting.

_ Section_ __ _ 3.9_ _Acceptance of Signatures_. The actions of the
Corporation and its officers, agents and/or inspectors in connection with or
with respect to accepting, rejecting or giving effect to shareholder
votes, consents, waivers and proxy appointments and/or determining the
validity of proxies shall be governed by IC 23-1-30-5.

may be set forth in the Indiana Business Corporation Law and/or the Articles
of Incorporation, all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the
authority of, and the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed
under the direction of, the Board of Directors.

 



8 ##### Table of Contents

  

_Section_ __ _ 4.2_ _Number of Directors; Qualifications_.

4.2.1 _Number of Directors_. The Board of Directors shall consist of two
members or such other number (greater or lesser) as the Board of Directors
may from time to time determine by resolution; provided, however, that no
decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of removing any
director prior to expiration of that directors term of office.

4.2.2 _Qualifications_. Directors need not be residents of the State of
Indiana or shareholders or employees of the Corporation. Each director shall
qualify by accepting his election to office either expressly or by acting as a
director.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ _Election of Directors; Term_. Except as otherwise
provided in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of these Bylaws, the directors shall be
elected each year at the annual meeting of shareholders to hold office until
the next annual meeting of shareholders. The term of each director, including
a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall expire at the next annual meeting
of shareholders following the directors election; provided, however, that
despite the expiration of a directors term, the director shall continue to
serve until a successor is elected and qualified or until there is a decrease
in the number of directors.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ _Resignation and Removal of Directors_.

 

4.4.1 _Resignation_. Any director may resign from the Board of Directors at
any time by delivering written notice of resignation to the Board of
Directors or to the President or the Secretary of the Corporation. A
resignation is effective when the notice is delivered, unless the notice
specifies a later effective date or any effective date determined upon the
happening of an event, in either of which cases the resignation is effective
at the specified time.

 4.4.2 _Removal_. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 4.4.2, and
unless the Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, the shareholders or
directors may remove one or more directors with or without cause.
Shareholders may remove a director only at a meeting of shareholders called
for the purpose of removing the director and the meeting notice must state
that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is the removal of the
director. If a director is elected by a voting group of shareholders, only
the shareholders of that voting group may participate in the vote to remove
that director. If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be
removed if the number of votes sufficient to elect a director under
cumulative voting is voted against the directors removal. If cumulative
voting is not authorized, a director may be removed only if the number of
votes cast to remove the director exceeds the number of votes cast not to
remove the director.

 



9 ##### Table of Contents

  

_Section_ __ _ 4.5_ _Vacancies on the Board of Directors_. Unless the
Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, if a vacancy occurs on the Board
of Directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of
directors, the Board of Directors may fill the vacancy. If the directors
remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the Board of Directors,
they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the
directors then remaining in office. If the vacant office was held by a
director elected by a voting group of shareholders, only the holders of
shares of that voting group are entitled to vote to fill the vacancy if it is
filled by the shareholders. A vacancy that will occur on the Board of
Directors at a specific later date may be filled before the vacancy occurs,
but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ _Meetings of the Board of Directors_.

 

4.6.1 _Regular Annual Meetings_. A regular annual meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held, without notice, immediately following, and at the
same place as, the annual meeting of the shareholders for the purpose of
organizing the Board and transacting such other business as may properly come
before the meeting.

 

4.6.2 _Other Regular Meetings_. Other regular meetings shall be held at such
times and places, either within or without the State of Indiana, as may be
designated from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Unless
otherwise provided by resolution of the Board of Directors, any such other
regular meeting may be held without notice of the date, time, place or
purpose of the meeting.

4.6.3 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be
called by the President or any member of the Board of Directors. The person
authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any
place within the county where the Corporation has its principal office as the
place for holding such special meeting, unless the directors have otherwise
unanimously agreed.

 

4.6.4 _Notice of Special Meetings_. Notice of the date, time and place of any
special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given at least two days
prior to the meeting date either orally or in writing, by any means of
communication; provided, however, if notice of the special meeting is mailed,
the notice shall be deposited in the United States mail at least five days
prior to the scheduled time of the meeting and shall be properly addressed,
with postage prepaid. The notice need not describe the purpose of the special
meeting. Any director may waive any notice required by the Indiana Business
Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws before or
after the date and time stated in the notice. Except as provided in the next
sentence, the waiver must be in writing, signed by the director entitled to
the notice, and filed with the minutes or corporate records of the
Corporation. A directors attendance at or participation in any meeting of the
Board of Directors waives any required notice of such meeting unless the
director at the beginning of the meeting (or promptly upon the directors
arrival) objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting
and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.

 



10 ##### Table of Contents

  

4.6.5 _Business to be Transacted_. Neither the business to be transacted
during, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of
Directors need be specified in the notice or any waiver of notice of such
meeting. Any and all business of any nature or character whatsoever may be
transacted and action may be taken thereon at any regular or special meeting
of the Board of Directors.

 

4.6.6 _Quorum; Vote Required For Action_. A majority of the number of
directors fixed in accordance with Section 4.2.1 of these Bylaws shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of any and all business (other than to
adjourn) at any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors. A
majority of the directors present at any directors meeting, whether or not a
quorum, may adjourn from time to time by fixing a new meeting time and place
prior to taking adjournment, but if any directors meeting is adjourned for
more than twenty-four hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or
place shall be given, prior to the reconvening of the adjourned meeting, to
any directors not present at the time the adjournment was taken. If a quorum
is present when a vote is taken at any regular or special meeting of the
Board of Directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present is
the act of the Board of Directors, unless the affirmative vote of a greater
number of directors is required by the Indiana Business Corporation Law, the
Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws. A meeting at which a quorum
initially is present may continue to transact business, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of one or more directors, if any action taken is approved by the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the required quorum for that
meeting.

_Section_ __ _ 4.7_ _Action by Written Consent_. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken
without a meeting if the action is taken by all members of the Board of
Directors and the action is evidenced by one or more written consents
describing the action taken, signed by each member of the Board of Directors,
delivered to the Secretary and included in the minutes or filed with the
corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under
this Section 4.7 is effective when the last director signs the consent unless
(a) the consent specifies a different prior or subsequent effective date, in
which case the consent is effective on that date, or (b) no effective
date contemplated by the preceding clause (a) is designated and the action
taken under this Section 4.7 is taken electronically as contemplated by IC
26-2-8, in which case the effective date is the date determined in accordance
with IC 26-2-8. A consent signed under this Section 4.7 has the effect of a
meeting vote and may be described as such in any document. A directors
consent may be withdrawn by a revocation signed by the director and delivered
to the Corporation before the delivery to the Corporation of unrevoked written
consents signed by all of the directors.

_Section_ __ _ 4.8_ _Meeting by Telephone or Similar
Communications Equipment_. Any or all directors may participate in any
regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors by, or conduct the
meeting through the use of, conference telephone or any other means of

4.9.1 _Creation of Committees_. The Board of Directors may create one or more
committees and appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on them.

of members to it must be approved by the greater of:

(a) a majority of all of the directors in office when the action is taken; or

 

(b) the number of directors required to take action (other than to adjourn a
meeting) pursuant to Section 4.6.6 of these Bylaws.

4.9.3 _Committee Procedures_. Sections 4.6 through 4.8 of these Bylaws, which
govern meetings, action without meetings, notice, waiver of notice, quorum,
and voting requirements of the Board of Directors, apply to committees of the
Board of Directors and their members as well, except that the date, time and
place of regular meetings of committees may be determined either by
resolution of the Board of Directors or of the members of the committees. The
Board of Directors may adopt rules for the governing of any committee not
inconsistent with the provisions of these Bylaws.

 

4.9.4 _Delegation of Authority_. Each committee may exercise the authority of
the Board of Directors which the Board of Directors delegates to such
committee in the resolution creating the committee or in subsequent
resolutions; provided, however, that a committee may not take any of the
actions specified in IC 23-1-34-6(e) or otherwise precluded by the Indiana
Business Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

 

 _Section 4.10_ _Presumption of Assent_. A director who is present at a
meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors
when corporate action is taken is deemed to have assented to the action taken
unless:

 

(a) the director objects at the beginning of the meeting (or promptly upon the
directors arrival) to holding the meeting or transacting business at the
meeting;

 



12 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) the directors dissent or abstention from the action taken is entered in
the minutes of the meeting; or

(c) the director delivers written notice of the directors dissent
or abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its adjournment
or to the Secretary of the Corporation immediately after adjournment of the
meeting.

 

The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a director who votes in
favor of the action taken.

 

 _Section 4.11_ _Compensation of Directors_. Directors and committee members
may receive such compensation, if any, for their services, and may be
reimbursed for expenses incurred by them on behalf of the Corporation, in the
manner and to the extent provided in resolutions duly adopted by the Board of
Directors. This Section 4.11 shall not preclude any director from also
serving as an officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation and receiving
compensation from the Corporation for service in any of those capacities.

members of the Board of Directors, and any two or more offices may be held by
the same person.

5.2.3 _Tenure_. Each officer of the Corporation shall serve at the pleasure
of the Board of Directors and the election or appointment of an officer does
not itself create contract rights. If an officer of the Corporation is
appointed by the Board of Directors for a designated term, the Board of
Directors may, nonetheless, remove the officer at any time prior to the
termination of that term. If no term is specified, an officer shall hold
office until the officers death, resignation or removal pursuant to Section
5.4 of these Bylaws.

 _Section 5.4_ _Resignation and Removal of Officers_.

notice to the Board of Directors, the President, or the Secretary of the

make it effective.

5.4.2 _Removal_. Any of the principal officers specified in Section 5.1 of
these Bylaws may be removed, at any time with or without cause, by a majority
of the directors at the time in office, at any regular or special meeting of
the Board of Directors. Any subordinate officer appointed pursuant to Section
5.3 of these Bylaws may be removed, at any time with or without cause, by (a)
action of the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting of the
Board of Directors, or (b) if the officer being removed was appointed by
another officer, by the appointing officer.

_Section 5.5_ _Vacancies_. Whenever any vacancy shall occur in any office by
death, resignation, removal, increase in the number of officers of the
Corporation, or otherwise, the same may be filled by the Board of Directors at
any regular or special meeting of the Board, or in such manner as may
otherwise be prescribed in these Bylaws for regular appointment to office. If
an officer resigns effective at a future date, and the Corporation accepts the
future effective date, the Board of Directors may fill the pending vacancy
before the effective date, if the Board of Directors provides that the
successor does not take office until the effective date.

 

 _Section 5.6_ _Powers and Duties of Officers_.

 

5.6.1 _General Powers and Duties_. Each principal officer has the authority
and shall perform the duties set forth in these Bylaws or, to the extent
