of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to
evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be mailed or
delivered to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock (the " _ _Certificates__ ") (i) a letter of

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

### transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Parent, and passage of the Effective
Time, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Closing Price Per Series A Share, the Closing Price Per
Series B Share, Closing Price Per Common Share or the Common Price Per Share,
as appropriate; provided, however, that in the event that such executed
documents and Certificates are received prior to the Effective Time, such
documents and Certificates shall be held in escrow by the Parent or its
designee, acting as paying agent (the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), until the
Effective Time.  Upon delivery by the Paying Agent to Parent (in the event
that Parent is not the Paying Agent) of such Certificates for cancellation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive, and shall promptly receive, cash in an amount equal to the number of
shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such certificate multiplied by
the Closing Price Per Series A Share, the Closing Price Per Series B Share,
Closing Price Per Common Share or the Common Price Per Share, as appropriate
(the " _ _Aggregate Closing Price Per Certificate__ "), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled by Company. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate that, prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, to evidence the right only to receive the
Aggregate Closing Price Per Certificate for the shares of Company Capital
Stock represented thereby without interest.

  

### 

  

### (b) Neither Parent, Surviving Corporation nor Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount
properly delivered to a public official in compliance with any abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

  

### 

  

### (c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares
of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates representing shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Capital
Stock, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or by law.

  

### 

  

### (d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, and complying with such other conditions as Parent may
reasonably impose (including the execution of an indemnification undertaking
in favor of Parent with respect to the Certificate alleged to be lost, stolen
or destroyed), will deliver to such person, the Aggregate Closing Price Per
Certificate as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1.

  

### 

  

2.3 _Escrow_. An amount equal to $34,000,000 (the " _ _Escrow Amount__

_Escrow Fund__ ") in an account (the " _ _Escrow Account__ ") pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the " _ _Escrow Agreement__ ") among
Parent, the Shareholders Representative and the Escrow Agent in the form of
_Exhibit C_. The Escrow Amount shall

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

initially be equal to the sum of (i) the Per Share Series A Escrow Amount
multiplied by the number of issued and outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the Per Share
Series B Escrow Amount multiplied by the number of issued and outstanding
shares of Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (iii) the Per Share Common Escrow Amount multiplied by the number of
issued and outstanding shares of Other Outstanding Common immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Distributions of any amounts from the Escrow Account
shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

2.4 _Adjustment of Shares_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number, classes or series
of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall occur, including
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of such shares of Company
Capital Stock, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such
period, the Series A Price Per Share, the Series B Price Per Share, the
Common Price Per Share, and the respective Per Share Escrow Amounts for each
of the foregoing, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement,
as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

2.5 _Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the aggregate value delivered by Parent
in exchange for the Company Capital Stock (the " _ _Merger Consideration__ ")
shall equal $161,500,000, _plus_  (x) the value of all cash and cash
equivalents held by the Company as of the Effective Date, up to a maximum of
$1,000,000, _less_ (y) the amount of any Company Debt that has not been
discharged prior to the Effective Date. " _ _Company Debt__ " means, whether
or not reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet, all indebtedness or guarantees
of indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company and/or the Subsidiaries
owed to financial institutions, the holders of Company Capital Stock, or
other Persons, including, but not limited to, the indebtedness listed on
Schedule 2.5, the aggregate amount of all outstanding principal, and any
unpaid fees and expenses, premiums, penalties or other amounts (including
losses, costs, penalties and expenses, if any, of lenders relating to the
foregoing items arising from the payment or prepayment of such items) payable
in connection with the payment or repayment prior to or after the Closing of
any of the foregoing.

protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section
6.10. If, in the absence

the preservation of the business of Parent.  MJN acknowledges that Parent is
not entitled to indemnification under Article IX of this Agreement or under

of the covenants contained in Sections 6.8, 6.9 and 6.10 of this Agreement

substantial and irreparable harm to Parent for which no adequate remedy may
exist at law.  Accordingly, MJN acknowledges: (i) the right of Parent to
bring an action in law against him personally for breaches of the covenants
contained in Sections 6.8, 6.9 or 6.10 and (ii) in addition to any relief at
law that may be available to Parent for such violation or breach and
regardless of any other provision contained in this Agreement, Parent will be
entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief restraining such violation
or breach (without any requirement that Parent provide any bond or other
security).

  

### 

  

### (b) In the event of a violation or breach by MJN of any agreement set
forth in Sections 6.8, 6.9 and 6.10, the term of such agreement will be
extended by the period of the duration of such violation or breach.

  

### 

  

### (c) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares
that any term or provision of Sections 6.8, 6.9 or 6.10 is invalid or
unenforceable, the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of
the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be

43   

     
   

  



  

9.2 _Indemnification by Shareholders_.

  



  

### (a) Subject to the limitations of Sections 9.2(b) and 9.2(c) hereof, and

deficiency, action, damage, expense or cost (including reasonable legal
expenses), whether or not actually incurred or paid (collectively " _
_Losses__ "), which the Parent Indemnified Parties may suffer, sustain or
become subject to as a result of (i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in
or breach of any of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedule or closing
certificates delivered or to be delivered by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (collectively, the " _
_Related Documents__ ") or (ii) any breach of, or failure to perform, any

_Parent Losses__ "). The indemnification provided by this Section 9.2(a)
shall be satisfied (i) initially from the Escrow Amount during the term of
the Escrow Agreement and (ii) thereafter, to the extent applicable, in

### 

  

### (b) Until the termination of the Escrow Agreement, the Holders will be
liable to the Parent Indemnified Parties for any Parent Loss, and Parent
shall offset against the Escrow Amount in the manner permitted by this
Section 9.2(b)) (i) only if Parent delivers to Shareholders Representative a
written notice, pursuant to Section 9.4 and 9.5, as applicable, with respect
to such Parent Indemnified Partys Claim to be indemnified for such Parent
Losses prior to two years after the Closing Date and (ii) only if the
aggregate amount of all Parent Losses exceeds $1,300,000 (the " _
_Basket Amount__ "), in which case the Holders shall be obligated
to indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties for the total amount of such Parent
Losses in excess of the Basket Amount, as limited by the Cap (as defined
below); _provided, however_ , that the Basket Amount shall apply only to
breaches, inaccuracies or misrepresentations of representations and
warranties other than those set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.12
hereof and shall not apply to (i) any breaches of any covenants of the
Company set forth in Article V or Article VI of this Agreement or (ii) any
Parent Losses related to any action required to enforce the indemnification
obligations contained in this Agreement. Except for actual fraud in connection
with any breach or misrepresentation by the Company, the aggregate liability
of the Holders for all amounts under this Section 9.2, including, but not
limited to, costs of litigation and expenses related thereto, shall not
exceed an amount equal to $34,000,000 (the " _ _Cap__ ").

  

### 

  

### (c) After the termination of the Escrow Agreement, the Holders that are
parties to the Voting Agreements to be delivered at Closing will be liable to
the Parent Indemnified Parties for any Parent Loss arising from a breach of
any of the Extended Reps or any covenant of the Company set forth in Article
V or Article VI or any indemnification obligations contained in this
Agreement the performance of which may or is specified to occur after the
expiration of such two-year period for which a claim may be brought through
the survival period set forth in Section 9.1, and Parent shall be entitled to
reimbursement pursuant to the indemnification terms contained in the Voting
Agreement, (i) only if Parent delivers to Shareholders Representative a
written notice, pursuant to Section 9.4 and 9.5, as applicable, with respect
to such Parent

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

### Indemnified Partys Claim to be indemnified for such Parent Losses prior
to expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 9.1 and
(ii) to the extent the aggregate amount of all Parent Losses exceeds the
Basket Amount, in which case the Holders that are parties to the
Voting Agreement to be delivered at Closing shall be obligated to indemnify
Parent Indemnified Parties for the total amount of such Parent Losses
(including, but not limited to, those incurred prior to the termination of
the Escrow Agreement) in excess of the Basket Amount, _provided, however_ ,
that the Basket Amount shall apply only to breaches, inaccuracies or
misrepresentations of representations and warranties other than those set
forth in Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.12 hereof and shall not apply to (i)
any breaches of any covenants of the Company set forth in Article V or
Article VI of this Agreement or (ii) any Parent Losses related to any action
required to enforce the indemnification obligations contained in this
Agreement. Except for actual fraud in connection with any breach or
misrepresentation by the Company, the aggregate liability of the Holders that
are parties to the Voting Agreement to be delivered at Closing for all
amounts under this Section 9.2(c) shall not exceed an amount equal to the

paid to Parent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  

### 

  

9.3 _Indemnification by Parent_.

  



  

### (a) Subject to the limitations of Section 9.3(b) and hereof, Parent
agrees to indemnify in full holders of Company Capital Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and subsidiaries (collectively, the " _
_Holder Indemnified Parties__ ") and hold them harmless from and against any
Losses which any of the Holder Indemnified Parties may suffer, sustain
or become subject to, arising from or relating to (i) any inaccuracy
or misrepresentation in or breach of any of the representations and
warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement or other Related Documents,
(ii) any breach of, or failure to perform, any covenant of Parent contained
in this Agreement, or (iii) any Claims or threatened Claims against any
Company Indemnified Party arising out of the actions or inactions of the
Parent with respect to the Parents business or the Property after the
Closing Date (collectively, the " _ _Holder Losses__ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent will be liable to the Holder Indemnified Parties for any
Holder Loss (i) only if Shareholders Representative delivers to Parent a
written notice, pursuant to Section 9.4 or 9.5, as applicable, with respect
to such Holder Indemnified Partys claim to be indemnified for such Holder
Losses prior to two years after the Closing Date, except for claims arising
from a breach of any of the Extended Reps or any covenant the performance of
which may or is specified to occur after the expiration of such two-year
period, for which a claim may be brought through the survival period
described in Section 9.1, and (ii) only if the aggregate amount of all Holder
Losses exceeds the Basket Amount, in which case Parent shall be obligated to
indemnify the Holder Indemnified Parties for the total amount of all such
Holder Losses in excess of the Basket Amount; _provided, however_ , that the
Basket Amount shall apply only to breaches of or inaccuracies
in representations and warranties other than Sections 4.1 and 4.2 hereof and
shall not apply to (i) any breaches of any covenants of the Company set forth
in Article V or Article VI of this Agreement or (ii) any Holder Losses
related to any action required to enforce the indemnification obligations
contained in this Agreement.  Except for actual fraud in connection with any
breach or misrepresentation by Parent, Parents aggregate liability for all
amounts under

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

### this Section 9.3, including, but not limited to, costs of litigation and
expenses related thereto, shall not exceed an amount equal to the Cap.

  

### 

  

9.4 _Notice of Claims_. Any written notice required to be delivered to the
applicable Indemnifying Party under Section 9.2 or 9.3, as the case may be,
shall specify in reasonable detail (i) the representation and warranty or
covenant that is alleged to have been inaccurate or to have been breached,
(ii) the basis for such allegation and (iii) if known, the aggregate amount
of the Losses for which a claim is being made under this Article IX or, to
the extent that such Losses are not known or have not been incurred at the
time such claim is made, an estimate, to be prepared in good faith, of the
aggregate potential amount of such Losses. Written notice to such Indemnifying
Party of the existence of a claim shall be given by the Indemnified Party
promptly after the Indemnified Party first receives notice of the potential
claim; _provided, however,_ that the Indemnified Party shall not be
foreclosed from seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article IX by any
failure to provide such prompt notice of the existence of a claim to
the applicable Indemnifying Party or to supply such relevant
supporting documentation, except and only to the extent that such
Indemnifying Party has been materially damaged or prejudiced as a result of
such delay.

  



  

9.5 _Method of Asserting Claims_. As used herein, an " _ _Indemnified
Party__ " shall refer to a Parent Indemnified Party or Holder Indemnified
Party, as applicable, and the "Indemnifying Party" shall refer to the party
or parties hereto obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party.

  



  

### (a) In the event that any Indemnified Party is made a defendant in or
party to any action or proceeding, judicial or administrative, instituted by
any third party for the liability or the costs or expenses of which are
Losses (any such third party action or proceeding being referred to as a " _
_Claim__ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
notice thereof. The failure to give such notice shall not affect any
Indemnified Partys ability to seek reimbursement unless such failure has
materially damaged or prejudiced the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
successfully a Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to contest and
defend such Claim; _provided, that_ the Indemnifying Party (i) has a
reasonable basis for concluding that such defense may be successful and (ii)
can diligently contest and defend such Claim.  Notice of the intention to so
contest and defend shall be given by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party within 20 business days after the Indemnified Partys
notice of such Claim (but, in all events, at least five business days prior
to the date that an answer to such Claim is due to be filed). Such contest
and defense shall be conducted by reputable attorneys retained by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled at any time, at
its own cost and expense (which expense shall not constitute a Loss unless
the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the Indemnifying Party is
not adequately representing or, because of a conflict of interest, may not
adequately represent, any interests of any Indemnified Party, and only to the
extent that such expenses are reasonable), to participate in such contest and
defense and to be represented by reputable attorneys of its or their
own choosing. If the Indemnified Party elects to participate in such
defense, the Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
the conduct of such defense. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party to the extent reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party in the contest and defense of such Claim, including
providing reasonable access (upon reasonable notice) to the books, records
and employees of the Indemnified Party if relevant to the defense of such
Claim; _provided that_ , such cooperation shall not unduly disrupt the
operations of the

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

### business of the Indemnified Party or cause the Indemnified Party to waive
any statutory or common law privileges, breach any
confidentiality obligations owed to third parties or otherwise cause any
trade secret or confidential information of such Indemnified Party to become
public. Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party may concede,
settle or compromise any Claim without the consent of the other party, which
consents will not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) if a Claim solely seeks the issue of an injunction, or (ii)
if the subject matter of a Claim relates to the ongoing business of any of
the Indemnified Parties, which Claim, if decided against any of the
Indemnified Parties, would materially adversely affect the ongoing business
or reputation of any of the Indemnified Parties, then, in each such case, the
Indemnified Parties alone shall be entitled to contest, defend and settle
such Claim in the first instance and, if the Indemnified Parties do not
contest, defend or settle such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall then have
the right to contest and defend (but not settle) such Claim.

  

### 

  

### (b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against the
Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver a notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying
Party or, if holders of the Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time are the Indemnifying Party, to the Shareholders
Representative. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnifying Party does not dispute the claim described in such notice or
fails to notify the Indemnified Party within 20 business days after delivery
of such notice by the Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying Party
disputes the claim described in such notice, the Loss in the amount specified
in the Indemnified Partys notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay (subject to the
Basket Amount, to the extent applicable and the Cap), the amount of such Loss
to the Indemnified Party on demand. If the Indemnifying Party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such claim, Shareholders
Representative and an officer of Parent will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through the
negotiations of such individuals within 20 days after the delivery of the
Indemnified Partys notice of such claim, such dispute shall be resolved
fully and finally in Boston, Massachusetts by an arbitrator selected pursuant
to and an arbitration governed by Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, as modified herein. The parties
will jointly appoint a mutually acceptable independent arbitrator,
seeking assistance in such regard from the American Arbitration Association.
The arbitrator shall resolve the dispute based on the governing law, without
regard to its rules of evidence, and judgment upon the award rendered by
such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each
of Parent, on the one hand, and Shareholders Representative, on the other,
shall bear its own fees and expenses in connection with such arbitration and
shall bear 50% of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator.

  

### 

  

9.6 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, the rights set forth in
this Article IX and in the Voting Agreement to be delivered at Closing shall
be each partys sole and exclusive remedies against the other parties hereto
for misrepresentations, inaccuracies or breaches of representations,
warranties and covenants (other than the covenants of MJN contained in
Article VI) contained in this Agreement and the Related Documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent any of the
parties hereto from bringing an action based upon allegations of actual fraud
in connection with this Agreement and the Related Documents.  In the event
such action is brought, Parent, on the one hand, and

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

Shareholders Representative, on the other, shall bear its own fees and
expenses in connection with such action.

  



  

9.7 _Shareholders  Representative_.

  



  

### (a) MJN shall act as the representative of holders of Company Capital
Stock (referred to in his capacity as such representative as the " _
_Shareholders  Representative__") and shall be authorized to take any action
and to make and deliver any certificate, notice, consent or instrument
required or permitted to be made or delivered under this Agreement or under
the documents referred to in this Agreement, to waive any requirements of
this Agreement or to enter into one or more amendments or supplements to this
Agreement that Shareholders Representative determines in
Shareholders Representatives sole and absolute discretion to be necessary,
appropriate or advisable, which authority includes the execution and delivery
of the Escrow Agreement and any amendments or supplements thereto and the
performance of all obligations thereunder, including authority to collect and
pay funds and dispute, settle, compromise and make all claims. The authority
of Shareholders Representative includes the right to hire or retain, at the
sole expense of the holders of Company Capital Stock, such
counsel, investment bankers, accountants, representatives and other
professional advisors as Shareholders Representative determines in
Shareholders Representative sole and absolute discretion to be necessary,
appropriate or advisable in order to perform this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Any party will have the right to rely upon any action taken by
Shareholders Representative, and to act in accordance with such action
without independent investigation.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent will have no liability to any holder of Company Capital Stock
or otherwise arising out of the acts or omissions of Shareholders
Representative or any disputes among holders of Company Capital Stock or with
Shareholders Representative. Parent may rely entirely on its dealings with,
and notices to and from, Shareholders Representative to satisfy any
obligations it might have under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
other agreement referred to in this Agreement.

which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way, other than
the Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect
until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

  



  

11.9 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Disclosure Schedule contains a series of
schedules corresponding to the Sections contained in Article III. Nothing in
the Disclosure Schedule is deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation and warranty made in this Agreement unless the Disclosure
Schedule identifies the exception with particularity. Each item so disclosed
in the Disclosure Schedule shall constitute an exception to
the representations and warranties to which it makes reference and shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to each section of the Disclosure
Schedule to which it relates and/or representation and warranty herein given,
without the necessity of repetitive disclosure or cross-reference, so long as
such item is fairly described with reasonable particularity and detail and
such description would indicate to a reasonable person that the item applies
to another schedule contained in the Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of
a document or other item is not deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty unless the representation or warranty relates
solely to the existence of the document or other item itself.

  



  

11.10 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may
be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto.

  



  

11.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more
than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one
and the same instrument. A facsimile signature will be considered an
original signature.

  



  

11.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (except for provisions
regarding the Merger as described in Article II, which shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts) regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

  



  

11.13 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Subject to the provisions of Section
9.5(b) hereof, each of parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement
of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the other party hereto or its
successors or assigns may be brought and determined in the Chancery or other
Courts of the State of Delaware or the Federal Courts sitting within the
State of Delaware, and each of parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard
to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts.

11.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, THE COMPANY AND THE
SHAREHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ACTIONS OF PARENT, THE COMPANY OR THE SHAREHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
