MERGER    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 22, 2004 (this
"Agreement"), by and among Marquee Holdings Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Marquee Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and AMC Entertainment Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company").   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"), Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will enter into a business
combination transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into
the Company (the "Merger");   WHEREAS, a committee of the Board of Directors
of the Company consisting solely of independent directors (the "Company
Independent Committee") has determined that the Merger is advisable to, and
in the best interests of, the holders of Company Common Stock (as defined
herein), has recommended the Merger to the Board of Directors of the Company
and has resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock vote
for the adoption of this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of
Directors of the Company (taking into account the recommendation of the
Company Independent Committee) and Merger Sub have each determined that the
Merger is advisable to, and in the best interests of, their respective
stockholders, have approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) and have resolved to recommend that their
respective stockholders vote for the adoption of this Agreement;   WHEREAS,
Parent, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, is approving and
adopting this Agreement as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub;   WHEREAS,
as a condition to and as an inducement to each of Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s
willingness to enter into this Agreement, the Apollo Investors (as defined
herein) are concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
entering into a voting and consent agreement, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A (the "Apollo Consent"), pursuant to which, among other things, the
Apollo Investors are consenting to and agreeing, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to vote in favor of certain of the transactions
contemplated herein, including the Merger;   WHEREAS, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition to the
willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, Parent,
certain Affiliates of Parent and the Apollo Investors are entering into an
Subscription Agreement (the "Parent Subscription Agreement"), pursuant to
which such entities will make equity contributions to Parent;   WHEREAS, as
a condition to and as an inducement to each of Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s
willingness to enter into this Agreement, the Trust (as defined herein) is,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, entering into
a voting agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Trust
Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Trust is
agreeing, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to vote in favor of
the Merger; and   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, each of Peter Brown and Philip Singleton has agreed to
affirm his existing employment agreement with the Company and to waive,
subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, certain provisions
thereof with respect to, and subject to and effective upon, the consummation
of the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and
the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   Section 1.1 The
Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As
a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").   Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of
the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place on the third Business Day after
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing) set forth in Article VII, unless this Agreement has been theretofore
terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto; provided that in no event shall the Closing
occur before October 1, 2004 (the actual date of the Closing being referred
to herein as the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of
Latham and Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022, unless
another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. On the Closing
Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
a certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of,
the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or if another date and time is
specified in such filing, such specified date and time, being the "Effective
Time").   Section 1.3 Effect of the Merger. The Merger will have
the effects provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as
otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.   Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
of Surviving Corporation.   (a) Certificate of Incorporation. At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as the certificate of
incorporation attached hereto as Exhibit C, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that Article I
thereof shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of the Corporation is
AMC Entertainment Inc."   (b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
take all actions necessary such that the bylaws of Merger Sub shall become
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.   Section 1.5 Directors and
Officers of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
take all actions necessary such that the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.  
ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section
2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders
of any of the following securities:   (a) Conversion Generally. Each share
of common stock, par value $0.66 2/3 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Common Stock") and each share of Company Class B Stock, par value $0.66 2/3
per share, in each case issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to $19.50 (the "Common Stock Consideration"). Each share of
Company Preferred Stock (as defined in Section 3.2) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time not owned of record by Parent or
Merger Sub shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to $2,727.27 (the "Preferred Stock Consideration"). The consideration
described in this section and payable with respect to a particular share of
Company Capital Stock is referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration."
Except as provided in this Section 2.1, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger, all shares of Company Capital Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall
thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock.   (b) Cancellation of
Company Treasury Shares. Each share of Company Capital Stock, if any, held by
the Company as treasury stock or held by any Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be affected by the Merger
and shall remain outstanding as capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
except that the number of such shares shall be adjusted in the Merger to
maintain relative ownership percentages.   (c) Cancellation of Shares Owned
by Parent or Merger Sub. Each share of Company Capital Stock, if any, held by
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.   (d) Capital
Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (e)
Change in Shares. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been changed
into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different class, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger
Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the holders of
Company Capital Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event. For avoidance of doubt, the conversion
of Company Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Company Preferred Stock Certificate of Designations shall not give rise to
any adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section
2.1(e).   Section 2.2 .Exchange of Certificates; Payment of
Merger Consideration.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company designated by Parent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the
Exchange Agent, cash sufficient to make the cash payments payable pursuant to
this Article II (the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section
2.2(d) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.  
(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person
who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company
Capital Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.1(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary
form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates that formerly evidenced the shares of Company
Capital Stock (each a "Certificate") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Subject to the following sentence, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a check for the cash which such holder has the
right to receive in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Parent\'s agreement with the Exchange Agent shall
provide that, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, the Apollo Investors and the Trust shall be entitled to receive
payment of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of the
shares of Company Capital Stock held by them by wire transfer of immediately
available funds as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time on the
Closing Date, to the account(s) designated by such stockholder. No interest
will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a).
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for
the cash which such holder has the right to receive in respect of such
holder\'s shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such shares of Company Capital Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall
be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration.   (c) No
Further Rights in Company Capital Stock. All cash paid and Shares issued upon
conversion of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital
Stock.   (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Capital Stock nine (9) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of Company Capital Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look solely to Parent with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable or issuable upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Capital Stock as of a
date which is immediately prior to such times as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any government entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (e) No
Liability. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to
any holder of Certificates for any Shares or cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   (f)
Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and
duly paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Capital Stock in respect to which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.   (g) Lost Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.   Section 2.3 Stock Transfer
Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Company Capital Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates
representing shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Capital Stock except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.   Section 2.4 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by stockholders of the Company who have demanded and perfected
their demands for appraisal of such shares in the time and manner provided
in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (each such stockholder, a "Dissenting Stockholder")
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as described in Section 2.1(a), but shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the
DGCL; provided, however, that if any such stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such stockholder\'s right
to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such stockholder\'s shares of
Company Capital Stock shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in
Section 2.1(a), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent
notice of all demands for appraisal and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all
Dissenting Stockholders. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation
shall, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any demand for payment from any
Dissenting Stockholder.   Section 2.5 Company Stock Options, Equity Awards
and Deferred Cash Awards.   (a) Each Company Stock Option which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable, shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash in lieu of such
cancelled Company Stock Option equal to the excess of (i) the product of (A)
the excess, if any, of (x) the Common Stock Consideration over (y) the per
share exercise price of such Company Stock Option multiplied by (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
over (ii) any income tax or employment tax withholding required under Code
with respect to the amounts referred to in clause (i). Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to make such payments as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time.   (b) Each Company Deferred Stock Unit which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested, shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash in lieu of such cancelled
Company Deferred Stock Unit equal to the excess of (i) Common Stock
Consideration over (ii) any income tax or employment tax withholding required
under the Code with respect to the amounts referred to in clause (i).  
ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that except as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter delivered to Parent and Merger Sub
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement:   Section 3.1 Corporate
Existence and Power.   (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware. Each Subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Company
Subsidiaries") is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below) on the Company. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority and all
necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed to do business, in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to
be so qualified or licensed that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of the Company\'s Restated and Amended Certificate of Incorporation
(the "Company Certificate of Incorporation"), Bylaws (the "Company Bylaws")
and minute books and the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and minute
books of each of the Company Subsidiaries, all as currently in effect.  
(b) Exhibit 21 to the Company\'s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended April 1, 2004 filed on June 23, 2004 (the "Company 10-K") sets
forth a true, correct and complete list of all Company Subsidiaries and their
respective jurisdictions of incorporation. All of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of each of the Company Subsidiaries are owned by the
Company or by a Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens and are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, calls, contracts, voting trusts, proxies or other
commitments, understandings, restrictions, arrangements, rights or warrants
with respect to any such Subsidiary\'s capital stock, including any right
obligating any such Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell additional shares of
its capital stock.   (c) The corporate records and minute books of the

delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are
within the corporate powers of the Company, and, except for the Company
Stockholder Approval, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes represented by the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company Class B Stock and the
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock not held by the Apollo
Investors, voting together as a single class (the "Company
Stockholder Approval"), is the only vote required to adopt this Agreement and
the Merger. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights, and to general
equitable principles.   (b) The Company Independent Committee at a meeting
duly called and held, and (subject to Section 6.4) not subsequently rescinded
or modified in any way, has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) are advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of the holders of Company Common Stock
(other than Parent, Merger Sub, the Apollo Investors, the holders of Company
Class B Stock and their respective Affiliates), (ii) recommended this
Agreement to the Board of Directors of the Company and (iii) resolved
(subject to Section 6.4) to recommend that the holders of Company Common
Stock (other than Parent, Merger Sub, the Apollo Investors, the holders of
Company Class B Stock and their respective Affiliates) vote for adoption of
this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company (after taking into
account the recommendation of the Company Independent Committee), at a
meeting duly called and held, and (subject to Section 6.4) not subsequently
rescinded or modified in any way, has duly (i) determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) are
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the
Company, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and (iii) resolved (subject
to Section 6.4) to recommend that the Company stockholders vote for the
adoption of this Agreement.   (c) The Company has taken all appropriate
actions so that the restrictions on business combinations contained in
Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply with respect to or as a result of this
Agreement, the Parent Subscription Agreement, the Apollo Consent, the Trust
Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger, without any further action on the part of the
stockholders or the Board of Directors of the Company. True, correct and
complete copies of all resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company
reflecting such actions have been previously provided to Parent. No other
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is applicable to or
purports to be applicable to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement.   Section 3.4 No Conflict; Required Filings and
Consents.   (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder will
not, (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or Company Bylaws or any equivalent organizational documents of
any Company Subsidiary (assuming the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained), (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and
permits described in Section 3.4(b) have been obtained and all filings and
notifications described in Section 3.4(b) have been made and any waiting
periods thereunder have terminated or expired, conflict with or violate any
Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or
affected or (iii) except for the Apollo Consent, require any consent
or approval under, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under,
or constitute a change of control or default (or an event which with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others
any right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of a Lien or other encumbrance on any property
or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract,
Company Permit or other instrument or obligation, except, with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company or (y) prevent or materially delay the performance of this
Agreement by the Company or the ability of the Company to take any action
necessary to consummate the Merger.   (b) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the
Company will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or filing with, or notification to, any domestic or foreign governmental,
administrative, juridicial or regulatory authority (a "Governmental Entity")
or any other Person (assuming the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained),
except (i) under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, any applicable Blue
Sky Law, the rules and regulations of the American Stock Exchange, (ii) under
the HSR Act and, if and to the extent necessary, foreign or supranational
antitrust and competition Laws, (iii) the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL and (iv) for such other
consents, approvals, authorizations, permits, filings or notifications, the
failure of which to make or obtain, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company or (y) prevent or materially delay the performance of this
Agreement by the Company or the ability of the Company to take any action
necessary to consummate the Merger.   Section 3.5 SEC Filings.   (a) The
Company has timely filed all forms, reports and documents (including all
Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes thereto) required to be filed by it under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, with the SEC since
January 1, 1999, including any amendments or supplements thereto
(collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). The Company SEC Documents, as of
their respective filing dates, (i) did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) complied
in all material respects with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, each as
in effect on the date so filed. No Company Subsidiary is subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company
has previously provided to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of
any amendment or modification which has not yet been filed with the SEC to
any agreement, document or other instrument which previously had been filed
by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, to the extent such amendment or modification is required to be filed
thereunder.   (b) The management of the Company has (i)
implemented disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including the Company Subsidiaries, is made known to the management
of the Company by others within those entities, and (ii) disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation, to the Company\'s outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (A) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that, in its good faith judgment, are reasonably likely to
materially affect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, known to
management that involves management or other employees who, in each case,
have a significant role in the Company\'s internal control over financial
reporting.   Section 3.6 Permits; Compliance With Law. Each of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all
authorizations, licenses, permits (including Environmental Permits),
certificates, approvals and clearances, and has submitted notices to, all
Governmental Entities necessary for the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
develop, construct, own, lease and operate its properties or other assets and
to carry on their respective businesses in the manner described in the
Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof and as it is being
conducted as of the date hereof (the "Company Permits"), and all such Company
Permits are valid, and in full force and effect, except where the failure to
have, or the suspension or cancellation of, or failure to be valid or in full
force and effect of, any of the Company Permits would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict
with, or in default or violation of, (i) any Law applicable to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (ii) any Company Permits,
except, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii), for any such conflicts,
defaults or violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  
Section 3.7 Financial Statements. The audited and unaudited financial
statements, including all related notes and schedules, contained in the
Company SEC Documents (or incorporated therein by reference) (collectively,
the "Company Financial Statements") (i) when filed, complied in all material
respects with all applicable accounting requirements and with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; (ii) present fairly in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of their respective dates and the
consolidated results of operations, retained earnings and cash flows of the
Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries for the respective periods
indicated; and (iii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except for changes
in accounting principles disclosed in the notes thereto and subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal year end adjustments which were not
and are not expected to be material in amount and the absence of related
notes).   Section 3.8 Absence of Certain Changes.   (a) Since April 1,
2004, except as specifically contemplated by, or as disclosed in, this
Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice, and there has not been any event, occurrence
or development which, (i) individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or
(ii) would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the performance of this Agreement by the Company
or the ability of the Company to take any action necessary to consummate the
Merger.   (b) Since April 1, 2004, except as specifically contemplated by,
or as disclosed in, this Agreement, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has taken any action that, if taken during the period of
this Agreement through the Effective Time, would require the consent of
Parent under Section 5.1.   Section 3.9 No Undisclosed Liabilities. There
are no liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
of the kind required to be reflected in the Company Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP, other than (i) liabilities disclosed or provided for in
the Company Financial Statements, (ii) liabilities incurred since April 1,
2004, in the ordinary course of business, and (iii) liabilities which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company.   Section 3.10 Litigation. There is no action,
suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or to the Knowledge of
the Company threatened against or affecting, the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or any of their
respective officers or directors, or for which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is obligated to indemnify a Third Party, before any court or
arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or (y) prevent or materially delay the
performance of this Agreement by the Company. There is no judgment, decree,
injunction, rule, writ or order of any governmental entity or arbitrator
outstanding against the Company or any Company Subsidiary which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or (y) prevent or materially delay the
performance of this Agreement by the Company.   Section 3.11 Taxes.   (a)
Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed or caused to
be timely filed with the appropriate Tax authorities all material Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by, or with respect to, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns
are true, correct and complete in all material respects. There are no
material Liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except Liens for Taxes not yet due.   (b) All material Taxes and
Tax liabilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been timely
paid or fully provided for as a liability on the financial statements of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in compliance with GAAP.   (c) Neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has been a party to any
distribution occurring during the two years preceding the date of this
Agreement in which the parties to such distribution treated the distribution
as subject to Section 355 of the Code.  (d) No deficiencies for material
Taxes have been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing against the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries by any Tax authority that have not been
finally resolved, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
Knowledge of any pending or threatened claim, proposal or assessment against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any such deficiency for material
Taxes. There are no pending audits, investigations or other proceedings
relating to any liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in respect
of any material Taxes.   Section 3.12 Contracts and Commitments.   (a)
Except as filed as exhibits to the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, or as disclosed in Section 3.12 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party
to or bound by any Contract which (i) as of the date hereof, is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC) or (ii) except for Leases for Company Leased
Real Properties, (A) involves aggregate expenditures in excess of $5 million,
(B) involves annual expenditures in excess of $5 million and is not
cancelable within one year, (C) which would prohibit or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or (D) contains any non-compete or exclusivity
provisions with respect to any line of business or geographic area with
respect to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of the Company\'s
current or future Affiliates, or which restricts the conduct of any line of
business by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of the Company\'s
current or future Affiliates or any geographic area in which the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of the Company\'s current or future Affiliates may
conduct business, in each case in any material respect. Each Contract of the
type described in Section 3.12, whether or not set forth in Section 3.12 of
the Company Disclosure Letter, is referred to herein as a "Company Material
Contract").   (b) Each Company Material Contract is valid and binding
on the Company or a Company Subsidiary party thereto and, to the
Company\'s Knowledge, each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect, and the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have performed
in all respects all obligations required to be performed by them to the date
hereof under each Company Material Contract and, to the Company\' Knowledge,
each other party to each Company Material Contract has performed in all
respects all obligations required to be performed by it under such Company
Material Contract, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   Section 3.13 Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Section 3.13(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true, correct and complete list of
each Company Employee Plan. With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the
Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the
Company Employee Plan and any amendments thereto (or if the Company Employee
Plan is not a written plan, a written description thereof). Each Company
Employee Plan has been established and maintained in material compliance with
its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes,
orders, rules and regulations (including but not limited to ERISA, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the Code) which are applicable to
such Company Employee Plan, except for such exceptions that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   (b) Neither the Company nor any Company
Affiliate has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not
been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk
to the Company or any Company Affiliate of incurring any such liability other
than liability for premiums due the PBGC (which premiums have been paid when
due).   (c) Each Company Employee Plan (which is not a
multiemployer pension plan) which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code is so qualified, each trust forming a part thereof is
exempt from federal income tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist which will adversely
affect such qualification or exemption.   (d) The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with any other event, (i) entitle any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Company ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any
other similar termination payment, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of, or otherwise enhance, any benefit due to
any such employee, officer, director or consultant. No amounts payable under
Company Employee Plans will fail to be deductible for federal income tax
purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code.   (e) No Company Employee
Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
nor is any Company Employee Plan a plan described in Section 4063(a) of
ERISA. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has no unpaid withdrawal
liability with respect to any "multiemployer pension plan" to which the
Company or any Company Affiliate has contributed or been obligated to
contribute. In the event the Company or any Company Affiliate withdrew in a
"complete withdrawal" from all "multiemployer pension plans" to which the
Company or any Company Affiliate has contributed, or been obligated to
contribute, as of the Effective Time, the aggregate withdrawal liability
incurred by the Company or such Company Affiliate would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   (f) No Company Employee Plan provides
benefits, including, without limitation, death or medical benefits (whether
or not insured), with respect to any current or former employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for periods extending beyond their
retirement or other termination of service (other than (i) coverage mandated
by applicable law, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any
"employee pension plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, or
(iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or former
employee (or his or her beneficiary)). There are no pending, or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf of
any Company Employee Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any
such Company Employee Plan, or otherwise involving any such Company Employee
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits or claims that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company).   (g) There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf of
any Company Employee Plan (which is not a multiemployer pension plan), by any
employee or beneficiary under any such plan or otherwise involving any such
plan (other than routine claims for benefits or claims that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company). No Company Employee Plan is under audit or
investigation by, nor has the Company been contacted with respect to any
Company Employee Plan by, the IRS, the PBGC or the Department of Labor. No
such audit, investigation or contact is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened as of the date of this Agreement.   (h) As of April 1,
2004, with respect to each Company Employee Plan (which is not a
multiemployer pension plan) that is a defined benefit plan, the projected
benefit obligations under all such plans, whether or not qualified,
including, but not limited to, the Defined Benefit Retirement Income Plan for
Certain Employees of American Multi-Cinema, Inc., the AMC Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan and the American Multi-Cinema, Inc. Retirement
Enhancement Plan, utilizing actuarial methods and assumptions set forth in
the Company 10-K, did not exceed the fair market value of the assets of such
plans as of such date by more than $30 million. As of the date hereof and as
of the Effective Time, the aggregate increase in any such underfunding since
April 1, 2004 (taking into account only such plans for which there is any
increase) would not, if all such plans were then terminated, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   (i) There is no Contract, plan or
arrangement with any current or former employee, officer or director of the
Company to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party as of the
date of this Agreement that, individually or in the aggregate and as a result
of the Merger (whether alone or upon the occurrence of additional or
subsequent events) or otherwise, is reasonably likely to give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m)
of the Code or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax law.   Section 3.14 Labor and Employment Matters.   (a)
Except as set forth in Section 3.14 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there
are no collective bargaining agreements with any union covering employees of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. As of the date of this
Agreement, (i) there is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown, stoppage or
lockout actually pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, threatened against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries; (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, no union organizing campaign with respect to the employees of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is threatened or underway;
(iii) there is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint against the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, threatened before the
National Labor Relations Board or any similar state or foreign agency; (iv)
there is no written grievance pending relating to any collective bargaining
agreement or other grievance procedure; and (v) to the Knowledge of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, no charges with respect to or
relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries are pending before
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other agency responsible
for the prevention of unlawful employment practices, except for such
exceptions to the foregoing clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   (b) The Company has made available to
Parent true, correct and complete copies of each of the Company\'s material
written personnel policies or rules applicable to employees of the Company or
of the Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries are, and have at all times been, in compliance with
all applicable Laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms
and conditions of employment, wages, hours of work and occupational safety
and health, except for such failures to be in compliance as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (c) As of the date hereof, within
the last three years, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have not
effectuated (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any
site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any
site of employment or facility of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting
any site of employment or facility of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries; nor has the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries been
affected by any transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment terminations
sufficient in number to trigger application of any similar state or local
Law.   Section 3.15 Real Property; Leases.   (a) Section 3.15(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a true, correct and complete list, by
location, of all real property owned by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (the "Company Owned Real Properties"). Except for (x) such
exceptions which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (y) any matters of
public record affecting the use of such properties and disclosed in writing
in title insurance policies with respect to the Company Owned Real Properties
made available to Parent prior to the date hereof and (z) Permitted
Encumbrances, (i) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title to the Company Owned Real Properties and (ii) the Company
Owned Real Properties are free and clear of all mortgages, Liens, leases,
tenancies, security interests, options to purchase or lease or rights of
first refusal. Section 3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
true, correct and complete list of all title insurance policies relating to
the Company Owned Real Properties.   (b) Section 3.15(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a true, correct and complete list, by address, of
all material real property leased by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(the "Company Leased Real Properties", and, together with the Company Owned
Real Properties, the "Company Real Properties"). The Company has made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all lease agreements
(the "Leases") with respect to the Company Leased Real Properties. With
respect to (A) the Company Leased Real Properties other than Significant
Theatre Properties, except for such exceptions which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company and (B) the Significant Theatre Properties:   (i) each Lease
is valid and binding upon the Company or  a Company Subsidiary and upon the
landlord thereunder and in full force  and effect and grants the lessee under
the Lease the exclusive right to  use and occupy the premises, and the

or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
and Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to any
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement or
Schedule 13E-3 based on information supplied by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.   Section 6.2 Company Stockholders\'
Meeting. The Company shall duly call and hold a meeting of its stockholders
(the "Company Stockholders\' Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable,
in compliance with applicable Law, following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger and any other matters the Company reasonably determines to be
necessary or appropriate. In connection with the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting and the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company will (i)
subject to Section 6.4, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting.   Section 6.3 Access to
Information; Confidentiality.   (a) From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
attorneys, accountants, advisors, representatives and agents (collectively,
"Representatives") to, (i) provide to Parent and Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives access at reasonable times upon prior notice to
the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities
(including each theatre premises) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and to the books and records thereof, and (ii) subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, furnish promptly such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities,
personnel and other aspects of itself and its Subsidiaries as the other party
and its Representatives may reasonably request. No investigation conducted
pursuant to this Section 6.3(a) shall affect or be deemed to modify or limit
any representation or warranty made in this Agreement. Such access shall
afford Parent the opportunity, outside of the Company\'s normal hours of
operation, to conduct visual inspections, take measurements, make surveys and
perform any standard "phase I" environmental inspections deemed desirable by
Parent.   (b) With respect to the data and information disclosed pursuant
to this Section 6.3, the parties shall comply with, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to comply with, their obligations under
the confidentiality agreement, dated May 28, 2004, previously executed by
J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC and the Company (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").   Section 6.4 No Solicitation by the Company.   (a) From the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that their respective
Affiliates and Representatives thereof do not, directly or indirectly through
another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by
way of furnishing information), or take any other action designed to
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
with, or disclose or provide any non-public information or data relating to
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to, or otherwise afford access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to,
any Third Party or any Representatives thereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement or agreement in
principle with any Third Party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
Company Alternative Transaction; provided, however, that, at any time prior
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company and
its Representatives may take any action described in clause (ii) of
this subsection (a) in response to any Person that has made a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof if, but only
if, (A) such written Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of
this Section 6.4 and the Company has fully complied with its obligations
under this Section 6.4, (B) such Third Party has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the Company on terms that are no less
favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement, (C) the Company
Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company (as
applicable) has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take any such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under
applicable Law and (D) prior to, or substantially concurrent with, disclosing
or providing any such non-public information, the Company shall (to the
extent it has not already done so) disclose or provide all such information
to Parent. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives, to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions,
conversations, negotiations and other communications with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.   (b) The Company shall promptly (and in
no event later than 24 hours after receipt thereof) advise Parent,
telephonically and in writing, of the Company\'s receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or request related to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, or that contemplates the possibility of,
any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in no event later
than 24 hours after receipt thereof) provide Parent, in writing, with the
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, or such proposal,
inquiry or request and the identity of the Person making the same.
Immediately upon determination by the Company Independent Committee or the
Board of Directors of the Company (as applicable) that an Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Parent
a written notice ("Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Parent that the
Company Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company (as
applicable) has so determined, specifying the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and providing Parent with a copy of the Superior Proposal.   (c)
Each of the Company Independent Committee and the Board of Directors of the
Company (as applicable) has adopted a resolution declaring advisable and
recommending adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders (the
"Company Recommendation"). Neither the Company Independent Committee nor the
Board of Directors of the Company (as applicable) shall (i) withdraw, qualify
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company Alternative Transaction
or (iii) enter into (or cause the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter
into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other agreement (A) related to any Company Alternative Transaction (other
than a customary confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with
the provisions of Section 6.4(a)) or (B) requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company (as
applicable) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law, (i) the Company
Independent Committee or the Board of Directors of Company (as applicable)
may withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company
Recommendation or approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a
Superior Proposal (a "Company Subsequent Determination"), (ii) the Company
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and/or (iii) the
Board of Directors of the Company may enter into (or cause the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to a
Superior Proposal; provided that concurrently with entering into any such
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
agreement (other than a customary confidentiality agreement) related to a
Superior Proposal the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) and pay the Expense Coverage Fee in accordance with Section
8.2(b).   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit
the Company (i) from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; provided that disclosures under this sentence shall not be a
basis, in themselves, for Parent or the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or (e) or (ii) from making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Independent Committee or the Board of Directors
of the Company (as applicable) has reasonably determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with applicable Law.   Section 6.5 Appropriate Action;
Consents; Filings.   (a) Parent and the Company shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
(ii) obtain any third party consents necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required (A)
to be obtained or made by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, and (B) to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental
Entity (including, without limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act
and antitrust and competition Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction), in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, including the
Merger, and (iv) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required
under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other applicable
federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and antitrust and
competition Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and (C) any other
applicable Law. Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all filings or submissions referenced in the
preceding sentence (including providing copies of all such documents to the
non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to
accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or other
inquiry of any Governmental Entity with respect to any such filing or
submission. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance,
and each shall consult the other on, all the information relating to Parent
and its Subsidiaries, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to,
any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and
the Company shall promptly notify and provide a copy to the other party of
any written communication received from any Governmental Entity with respect
to any filing or submission or with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company
shall give the other reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and
any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental
Entity regarding any such filing or any such transaction. In the event that
either party shall fail to obtain any non-governmental Third Party consent
described in clause (ii) of this Section 6.5(a), such party shall use all
reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by
the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company
and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective
businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result after
the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 6.5(a) shall require the expenditure of
money by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in exchange for any such non-
governmental Third Party consent.   (b) From the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each party shall promptly notify the other party in
writing of any pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or the Company, as
appropriate, threatened action, suit, arbitration or other proceeding or
investigation by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (i) challenging
or seeking damages in connection with the Merger or (ii) seeking to restrain
or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or otherwise limit the right of
Parent or its Subsidiaries to own or operate all or any portion of the
businesses or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries.   Section 6.6
Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and make
reasonable comment upon, any press release or making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and,
except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the
American Stock Exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation; provided, however, that
Parent or the Company may make any public statement in response to specific
questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company and
do not reveal non public information regarding the other parties.   Section
6.7 Financing.   (a) Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete
the transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letters in accordance with
the Commitment Letters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in
the event that Parent has been notified by the Lenders in writing that funds
will not be available pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter so as to enable
Parent and Merger Sub to proceed with the Closing in a timely manner, each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain alternative financing ("Alternative Financing") in an amount at least
equal to the Required Cash Amount (it being understood that such
commercially reasonable efforts would not require Parent to obtain financing
that is (i) with respect to the economic terms thereof, on terms less
favorable to Parent thereunder than those set forth in the Commitment Letters
or the financing arrangements relating thereto, as the case may be or (ii)
with respect to the non-economic terms thereof, on terms that are not
substantially similar to those set forth in the Commitment Letters or the
financing arrangements relating thereto, as the case may be) or on terms to
which the Company has granted its prior written consent.   (b) Amendments.
Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing or
any Alternative Financing in accordance with Section 6.7(a) and shall not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters or the Parent Subscription
Agreement without obtaining the prior written consent of the Company.   (c)
Cooperation. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to,
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause appropriate officers and employees to be
available, on a customary basis and upon reasonable notice, to meet with
prospective lenders and investors in presentations, meetings, road shows and
due diligence sessions, (ii) assist with the preparation of disclosure
documents in connection therewith and (iii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its independent accountants to provide assistance to Parent,
including providing consent to Parent to prepare and use their audit reports
and SAS 100 reviews relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and,
at the cost of Parent, to provide any necessary "comfort letters" in
connection with the Financing; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
no officer or director of the Company shall be required to execute any
documents, including without limitation any registration statement to
be filed with the SEC, any pledge and security documents or other
definitive financing documents. In connection with the Escrow Funding (as
such term is defined in the Debt Commitment Letter), the Company shall, at
the direction of Parent, provide a letter of credit in an amount sufficient
to pay all interest on the escrowed amounts accruing following the Escrow
Funding Date in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter (it being
understood that any interest earned on such escrowed amounts during the
escrow period shall be remitted to the Company following release of the
escrowed amounts).   Section 6.8 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].   Section 6.9
Employee Matters.   (a) Those individuals who are employed by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by operation of Law,
become employees of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time (each
such employee, "Affected Employee"); provided, however that this Section
6.9(a) shall not be construed to limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation to terminate the employment of any Affected Employee at any
time.   (b) Until April 1, 2005, the coverage and benefits provided to
Affected Employees pursuant to employee benefit plans or
arrangements maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any Parent
Subsidiary (other than equity or equity-based compensation plans) shall be,
in the aggregate, not less favorable than those provided to such
employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.   (c) The Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor
all Company Employee Plans in accordance with the terms thereof. Parent and
the Company acknowledge and agree that the consummation of the Merger shall
be a "change in control" (or "change of control," where applicable) for
purposes of the Company Employee Plans listed on Section 6.9(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.   (d) In order to compensate and retain Company
Insiders in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective
Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law in connection with the disposition of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options in the Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose, the Board of Directors of the Company, or
a committee of Non-Employee Directors (as such term is defined for purposes
of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) thereof, shall adopt a resolution
providing that the disposition by Company Insiders of Company Common Stock
and Company Stock Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, are intended to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. Actions described in this
Section 6.9(d) shall be taken in accordance with the interpretative letter,
dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP.   Section 6.10 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification
and Insurance.   (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification and advancement of expenses for matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time than are set forth in the Restated and Amended Certificate
of Incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were directors or officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and each person who serves or served as a director, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of any trust, pension or other employee benefit
plan or enterprise or partnership or joint venture of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each, together with such Person\'s heirs, executives,
administrators and Representatives, the "Indemnified Parties"), unless such
modification shall be required by Law.   (b) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain or cause to be maintained in effect for six years
from the Effective Time directors\' and officers\' liability insurance with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each of the Indemnified Parties, on terms with respect to coverage, amount
and advancement of expenses no less favorable than the directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company in effect
as of the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation or Parent be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 6.10(b) for any annual premium more than 250% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company for its directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policies in effect as of the date hereof (which such current annual
premium is set forth in Section 6.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter);
provided further, however, that, if the amount of the annual premium
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds such maximum
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain or procure, for such six-
year period, directors\' and officers\' insurance providing (to the Knowledge
of the Surviving Corporation at the time such insurance is procured, and
after inquiry of its insurance broker) the greatest coverage then available
for an annual premium equal to that maximum amount. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time from an
insurer or insurers which have an insurer financial strength rating by A.M.
Best Co. of at least "A", which policies provide the Indemnified Parties with
coverage, from the Effective Time to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on terms with respect to
coverage, amount and advancement of expenses no less favorable than the
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies maintained by the
Company in effect as of the date hereof. If such prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.   (c) In addition to the
other rights provided for in this Section 6.10 and not in limitation thereof
(but without in any way limiting or modifying the obligations of any
insurance carrier contemplated by Section 6.10(b)), for six years from and
after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation each shall
jointly and severally and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any liability to the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries), the Indemnified Parties
against all reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel), and all losses, claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, "Losses") in respect of any threatened, pending or
completed claim, action suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil,
administrative or investigative, based on, or arising out of or relating to
the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of the Company or of any of its current or former Subsidiaries or
any trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise or
partnership or joint venture of the Company or any of its current or former
Subsidiaries or arising out of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, in respect of acts or
omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby) (collectively, an "Indemnifiable Claim"); provided, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be responsible for any amounts paid in
settlement of any Indemnifiable Claim without the consent of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Surviving Corporation shall advance all reasonable expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by or on behalf of an
Indemnified Party in connection with an Indemnifiable Claim within 10 days
after receipt by it of a statement or statements from such Indemnified Party
requesting such advance or advances from time to time, provided that prior
thereto the Indemnified Party provides to the Surviving Corporation
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such person is not entitled to indemnification from the Surviving
Corporation. In the event any Indemnifiable Claim is asserted or made within
such six-year period, all rights to indemnification shall continue until such
claim is finally disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other
rulings in connection with such claim are fully satisfied. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party
in the defense of any action which is, or may result in, an Indemnifiable
Claim.   (d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and
severally liable to pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorney\'s fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
6.10. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 6.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party without the consent of such
Indemnified Party and shall survive the consummation of the Merger, it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.10
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10.   (e) In
the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.10.   Section 6.11 Certain Notices. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify
the other party hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event
that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party
to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not to be satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this
Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to
the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall
not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of
such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.  
Section 6.12 Solvency Matters. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate and each use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an opinion from an independent
expert of nationally recognized reputation, addressed to the respective
boards of directors of each of Parent and the Company and to the Company
Independent Committee, supporting the conclusion that, after giving effect to
all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without
limitation the Financings, any Alternative Financing and the payment of the
Required Cash Amount, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be
Solvent (or the equivalent thereof, as determined in the
reasonable discretion of Parent and the Company)(such opinion, the "Solvency
Opinion"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) make available their respective officers, agents and other
Representatives on a customary basis and upon reasonable notice and (ii)
provide or make available such information concerning the business,
properties, Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company as may
reasonably be requested in connection with delivering such Solvency
Opinion.   Section 6.13 Post-Closing Change of Control Offer. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event within 30
days thereof), Parent shall commence a Change of Control Offer (as defined in
the indenture relating to the Company\'s outstanding 9.5% Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2011) in order to comply with the Company\'s obligations with
respect to such notes as contained in such indenture, or shall take such
other actions as will satisfy in full the Company\'s obligations under such
indenture with respect thereto.   Section 6.14 Enforcement of Voting
Agreements. The Company hereby agrees that it shall enforce its rights under
the Apollo Consent and the Trust Voting Agreement, and shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, amend, modify or waive any of its rights or
grant any consent thereunder, or terminate or enter into any agreement with
such other party thereto which is inconsistent with the terms and subject
matter of either such agreement, in each case without the prior written
consent of Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall, if
directed by Parent following a breach by any party to the Apollo Consent or
the Trust Voting Agreement, use its reasonable efforts to seek a judicial or
governmental order requiring specific performance by the breaching party.
Expenses incurred by the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence (i) with respect to enforcement of the Trust Voting Agreement, shall
be borne by Parent and (ii) with respect to enforcement of the Apollo
Consent, shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company. Company shall
promptly provide Parent with a copy of any notice delivered pursuant to
Section 5.4 of the Trust Voting Agreement or Section 6.4 of the Apollo
Consent Agreement.   ARTICLE VII   CLOSING CONDITIONS   Section 7.1

expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true
and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
