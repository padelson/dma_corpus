that is a Business Day.

  



  

(d)  Each Party acknowledges that it and its attorneys have been
given an equal opportunity to negotiate the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are
to be resolved against the drafting Party or any similar rule operating
against the drafter of an agreement shall not be applicable to the

required under the Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with such Secretary of

Article III 
 PURCHASE PRICE; EFFECT ON SHARES

  



  

3.01   _Effects of Merger_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of Company Capital Stock:

  



  

(a)   _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b)   _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_.

  



  

(i)  The amounts payable hereunder in respect of the Company
Capital Stock shall be allocated among the holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with the Charter.

  



  

(ii)  Without limiting _Section 3.01(b)(i)_, as of the Effective
Time, all of the shares of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares, if any)
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder thereof shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) in the case
of the Company Common Stock and shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are
deemed to convert into the right to receive the Per Common Share Merger
Consideration, the Per Common Share Merger Consideration and (B) in the case
of the Company Preferred Stock, the amounts set forth under _Section 3.02_.

  



  

(c)   _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Any Excluded Share

any rights the holders of Dissenting Shares may have under _Section 3.01(d)_.

  



  

(d)   _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration but shall instead be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the Delaware Law. The Company shall provide to Parent (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal or purchase received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments related to such demands
served pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware Law and received by the
Company and (ii) the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands under Section 262 of the Delaware Law. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, or as otherwise
required under Section 262 of the Delaware Law, voluntarily make any payment
or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares. Parent shall be
entitled to retain any Per Share Merger Consideration not paid on account of
such Dissenting Shares pending resolution, withdrawal or loss of claims of
such holders.

Effective Time, pursuant to, and in accordance with Section 3F of the
Charter, all shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be deemed to convert
into the right to receive the Per Common Share Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b)   _Non-Converting Company Preferred Stock_. Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 3B
of the Charter (in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock) and Section 3B of
the applicable Certificate of Designation (in the case of all other series of
Company Preferred Stock), before any distribution or payment is made to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, all shares of Non-Converting
Company Preferred Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the
applicable Preferred Share Liquidation Preference for all purposes herein and
all shares of Non-Converting Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive such applicable Preferred
Share Liquidation Preference. If, as of the Effective Time, the Aggregate
Purchase Price is insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of the
Non-Converting Company Preferred Stock as required pursuant to this _Section
3.02(b)_ , then such Aggregate Purchase Price shall be distributed among the
holders of shares of Non-Converting Company Preferred Stock at the time
outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would
otherwise be respectively entitled if such amounts had been paid in full.

  



  

(c)   _Converting Company Preferred Stock_. Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5A of the
Charter (in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock) and Section 5A of the
applicable Certificate of Designation (in the case of all other series of
Company Preferred Stock), all shares of Converting Company Preferred Stock
shall be converted into such number of shares of Company Common Stock as
provided in the Charter or Certificate of Designation (as applicable) and all
shares of Converting Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the rights afforded to holders of Company Common Stock.

(i)  As of the Effective Time, each outstanding vested option
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Stock Plans shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such
Company Option to receive (without interest), subject to _Section
3.03(a)(iii)_, an amount in cash (the " _Option Cashout Amount_ ") equal to
the applicable Per Option Post-Closing Payments, if any.

  



  

(ii)  For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Effective Time, each
Company Option that is unvested shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled for no consideration or
payment.

  



  

(iii)  With respect to each Company Option that is vested as of the
Effective Time, upon the payment of any Post-Closing Payment, the applicable
Per Option Post-Closing Payment, if any, will be paid in accordance with the

payable in respect of the Company Options in accordance with this _Article

after such amounts become payable to the Stockholder Representative pursuant
to this _Article III_.

  



  

(b)   _Company Warrants_. Each of the Company Warrants that is
validly exercised in accordance with its terms prior to the Effective Time
will be entitled to receive an aggregate amount equal to the product of (i)
the Preferred Share Liquidation Preference applicable to the Series E
Preferred Stock multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Series E Preferred
Stock subject to such Company Warrant. Each of the Company Warrants that is
not so exercised prior to the Effective Time will expire and be deemed to be
extinguished and cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms.

  



  

(c)   _Company Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and the Company's board of directors or compensation committee, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions, including
provision of any required notice, that are necessary to (x) effectuate the
treatment of Company Options and Company Warrants pursuant to _Section
3.03_ and (y) cause the Stock Plans to terminate at or prior to the Effective
Time. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of
the Company or any other Person to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of
the Company Options and the Company Warrants.

  



  

3.04   _Payment Procedures_.

Date and no more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent the Company's good faith calculation of, and
reasonable supporting detail relating to, both the estimated Aggregate
Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price_ ") and
each component thereof (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "), together with
reasonable supporting detail relating to such component (including bank
statements dated as of the date that the Estimated Closing Statement is
provided, a reconciliation between any differences in the Company's cash
position and the bank statement, debt payoff letters and invoices). The
Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the terms
(including the definitions) of this Agreement. Parent shall have the right to
object to the amounts contained in the Estimated Closing Statement no later
than the third (3rd) Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date. The
Company shall in good faith consider the objections, if any, of Parent to the
Estimated Closing Statement and, if Parent has made any objections or if
there have been any changes to the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price, shall
reissue the Estimated Closing Statement containing the Estimated Aggregate
Purchase Price and each component thereof no later than the Business Day
immediately prior to the Closing Date with any such revisions that the Company
has determined in good faith are appropriate.

(c)  All Post-Closing Payments will be allocated as follows:

  



  

(i)  first, _pro rata_ to each share of Company Common Stock

Per Common Share Post-Closing Payments paid with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock (including shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are
deemed to convert into the right to receive the Per Common Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.02(a)_) equals […] and the

Company Common Stock subject to such […] Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time), and (C) each […] Option (with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such […] Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time).

  



  

(d)  On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent, the Stockholder
Representative and the Payments Administrator shall enter into the Payments
Administrator Agreement, which agreement shall have customary terms and shall
provide that on the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with the Payments
Administrator, for the benefit of the applicable Equityholders, an amount in
cash equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate Per Common Share Closing Payment
and (ii) the Aggregate Preferred Share Payment, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by the Payments
Administrator in writing no later than four (4) Business Days prior to the

3.04(d)_ (the " _Payments Administrator Fund_ ") shall be held and
disbursed by the Payments Administrator, and Parent shall cause the Payments
Administrator to hold and disburse the Payments Administrator Fund, in
accordance with this _Section 3.04_. Any portion of the amount deposited by
Parent (or caused to be deposited by Parent) that remains unclaimed by the
applicable Equityholders six (6) months after the Effective Time will, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, be returned to Parent upon demand.

(e)  As promptly as practicable on or after the Closing Date
(and in any event within 10 days after the Closing Date) and in accordance
with the Payments Administrator Agreement, the Payments Administrator shall
provide (i) to each Stockholder, a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall include a waiver and release pursuant to
which each Stockholder executes a full and unconditional release regarding
any and all claims as a Stockholder, including the calculation of the Per
Share Merger Consideration, as a condition to receiving the Per Share Merger
Consideration, in favor of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries and each of their directors, officers, managers,
employees and Affiliates, and which shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree), (ii) to each
Stockholder, if required, instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the certificates (if any) representing such Stockholder's shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (as applicable) (the " _Certificates_
") in exchange for such holder's right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each such share (or in the case of a lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit, if required, in the
manner provided in _Section 3.09_) and (iii) to each Stockholder that did
not execute and deliver to the Company a Written Consent, a notice of the
availability of appraisal rights under Delaware Law. Upon delivery of such
Letter of Transmittal to the Payments Administrator together with any such
Certificates, duly executed (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit, if required, in the
manner provided in _Section 3.09_), the holder shall be entitled to receive,
upon the date such holder delivers such documents to the Payments
Administrator (subject to the terms of the Payments Administrator Agreement),
in exchange for each of their shares of Company Common Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock an amount of cash equal to the Per Common Share Closing
Payment and in exchange for each of their shares of Non-Converting Company
Preferred Stock an amount of cash equal to the applicable Preferred Share
Liquidation Preference, and the shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock (as applicable) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.04(e)_, each share of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (as applicable) shall be
deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article III,_ and no cash shall be paid to the holder
of any such share in respect thereof. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority, any amounts
remaining unclaimed (whether held by the Payments Administrator, Parent or
otherwise) by holders of the Company's securities immediately prior to
such time shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
(as applicable).

  



  

(f)  The consideration to be paid in accordance with the terms
of this _Article III_ upon effectiveness of the Merger shall constitute
satisfaction in full of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock,
Company Preferred Stock, Company Warrants and Company Options (other than any
Dissenting Shares), and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(g)  For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, in no event shall the aggregate amount of consideration
payable by Parent to any Equityholder or any other holders of any equity or
debt securities of the Company pursuant to this _Section 3.04_ exceed the
Aggregate Purchase Price.

  



  

3.05   _Holdback_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, Parent shall holdback up to […] of
the Aggregate Purchase Price, which shall constitute a holdback used to
satisfy any indemnification amounts owed Parent from the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.02(a)(iv)_ (the " _Special Indemnity Holdback_ "). The amount of
the Special Indemnity Holdback set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence will be reduced to the extent that the Company has
provided documentation at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing,
that, in the reasonable determination of Parent's tax advisors (as stated in
writing) […] shall be deemed sufficient for such determination […] reduces
the amount of the potential Special Indemnity Losses. The Special
Indemnity Holdback shall be disbursed solely for the purposes and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  Following the Closing, to the extent that the Company or
the Stockholder Representative provides documentation that, in the reasonable
determination of Parent's tax advisors (as stated in writing) (it being
understood that […] shall be deemed sufficient for such determination), the
potential Special Indemnity Losses have been reduced, Parent shall release
such amounts from the Special Indemnity Holdback to the Payments
Administrator and, with respect to Company Options, to the Company, promptly
following such determination and allocated in accordance with _Section
3.04(c)_.

  



  

(c)  The amount remaining in the Special Indemnity Holdback, as
of the date that is two (2) years after the Closing Date (the " _Special
Indemnity Release Date_ "), shall be released to the Payments Administrator
and, with respect to Company Options, to the Company, no later than ten (10)
Business Days following the Special Indemnity Release Date and allocated in
accordance with _Section 3.04(c)_ ; _provided_ that if there are any claims
for Losses under _Section 10.02(a)(iv)_  that are pending on the Special
Indemnity Release Date, the applicable portion (and only the applicable
portion) of the Special Indemnity Holdback that is subject to any such Losses
shall not be so released until such applicable Losses are finally
resolved and satisfied. The Payments Administrator shall distribute the
portion of the Special Indemnity Holdback that is distributable to the
Equityholders in accordance with Section 3.04(c) and the Payments
Administrator Agreement promptly after its release from the Special Indemnity
Holdback, as applicable, and the Surviving Company shall process the portion
of the Special Indemnity Holdback that is payable in respect of Company
Options through its payroll. To the extent amounts of the Special Indemnity
Holdback are distributed to the Equityholders, the Stockholder Representative
shall be entitled to be reimbursed from such distributed amounts from the
Special Indemnity Holdback for any out-of-pocket costs (including attorney
fees) for administering claims relating to Losses, to the extent there are
not adequate funds available in the Expense Fund to cover the reimbursement of
such out-of-pocket costs.

3.06   _Aggregate Closing Payment Schedule_. _Schedule C_ attached
hereto sets forth the Company's preliminary calculation of the allocation of
the Aggregate Closing Amount and the allocation of the Aggregate Cash Amount
entitled to be received in accordance with this Agreement by each
Equityholder. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date
(but subject to updates based on revisions, if any, to the Estimated Closing
Statement pursuant to _Section 3.04(a)_), the Company shall deliver to
Parent a schedule (the " _Aggregate Closing Payment Schedule_ ") setting forth
(a) the final allocation of the Aggregate Closing Amount to be paid in
accordance with this Agreement to each Equityholder and (b) the final
allocation of the Aggregate Cash Amount to be paid in accordance with this
Agreement to each Equityholder. Parent shall be entitled to rely exclusively
upon the Aggregate Closing Payment Schedule in paying the Aggregate Cash
Amount pursuant to _Section 3.04_ and shall have no obligation to
investigate the entitlements of any Person to any portion of the Aggregate
Cash Amount payable at Closing.

  



  

3.07   _Post-Closing Determination of the Closing Statement_.

  



  

(a)  Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a good faith
calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price and each component thereof (the "
_Closing Statement_ "). The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Closing
Statement, and the component items and calculations therein, shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the terms (including the definitions) of
this Agreement. If Parent fails to deliver the Closing Statement in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then the Estimated Closing
Statement delivered by the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section 3.04(a)_
shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Statement. The Closing Statement shall
be conclusive, final and binding on all Parties absent manifest error unless
the Stockholder Representative gives Parent written notice (the "
_Dispute Notice_ ") of any disputes or objections thereto (collectively, the
" _Disputed Items_ "), with its good faith calculation of, and reasonable
supporting detail relating to, such Disputed Items, within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the Closing Statement (such period, the " _Review Period_ "). In
the event the Stockholder Representative fails to deliver to Parent a Dispute
Notice prior to the expiration of the Review Period or otherwise earlier
notifies Parent in writing that the Stockholder Representative has no
disputes or objections to the Closing Statement, the amounts set forth in the
Closing Statement shall be conclusive, final and binding on all Parties
absent manifest error.

  



  

(b)  Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall, for a
period of ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as Parent and the
Stockholder Representative may agree in writing) following delivery of a
Dispute Notice to Parent (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith
to resolve their differences, and any such resolution by them as to any
Disputed Items shall be conclusive, final and binding on all Parties absent
manifest error. Any Disputed Items agreed to by Parent and the
Stockholder Representative in writing, together with any items or
calculations set forth in the Closing Statement not disputed or objected to
by the Stockholder Representative in the Dispute Notice, are collectively
referred to herein as the " _Resolved Matters_ ". Any Resolved Matters shall
be conclusive, final and binding on all Parties absent manifest error, except
to the extent such component could be affected by other components of the
calculations set forth in the Closing Statement that are the subject of a
Dispute Notice.

(c)  If at the end of the Resolution Period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative have been unable to resolve any differences that
they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Dispute Notice,
either of Parent or the Stockholder Representative may, upon written notice
to the other, refer all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the
Dispute Notice (the " _Unresolved Matters_ ") for resolution to the
Independent Accountant who shall, acting as an expert in accounting and not
arbitrator, render its decision on the Unresolved Matters (and not on any
other matter or calculation set forth in the Closing Statement) in a manner
consistent with the terms (including the definitions) of this Agreement. In
resolving any Unresolved Matter, the Independent Accountant may not assign a
value to any Unresolved Matter greater than the maximum value for such
matter claimed by either party or less than the minimum value for such matter
claimed by either party. The Independent Accountant's determination as to
each Unresolved Matter shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to
each of Parent and the Stockholder Representative within ten (10) Business
Days after such items are submitted for determination, with such written
statement including (i) the Independent Accountant's determination as to the
calculation of each of the Unresolved Matters and (ii) the
corresponding corrective calculations set forth in the Closing Statement that
are derived from its determination as to the calculations of the Unresolved
Matters, all of which shall be conclusive, final and binding on all Parties
absent manifest error. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each
pay the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant based on the inverse
of the percentage of the amounts that the Independent Accountant determines
in such party's favor bears to the aggregate amount of the total
Unresolved Matters as originally submitted to the Independent Accountant. By
way of example only, should the aggregate Unresolved Matters sum to $1,000,
and the Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of the Stockholder
Representative's position, sixty percent (60%) of the Independent
Accountant's fees and expenses would be borne by Parent and forty percent
(40%) would be borne by the Stockholder Representative. The Independent
Accountant's fees and expenses payable by Parent (if any) shall be paid
to the Independent Accountant directly by Parent, and the Independent
Accountant's fees and expenses payable by the Stockholder Representative (if
any, solely on behalf of the Equityholders) shall be paid from the Expense
Fund. To the extent the Expense Fund is insufficient or unavailable to cover
all of the Independent Accountant's fees and expenses payable by the
Stockholder Representative, Parent shall pay any such remaining fees and
expenses and Parent shall be entitled to deduct such amounts from any amounts
payable to the applicable Equityholders (or to the Payments Administrator on
their behalf) pursuant to this _Section 3.07_ or _Section 3.08_ of this
Agreement.

  



  

(d)  For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Final Closing
Statement_ " shall be (i) in the event that no Closing Statement is delivered
by Parent to the Stockholder Representative within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, the Estimated Closing Statement, (ii) in the event that no
Dispute Notice is delivered by the Stockholder Representative to Parent prior
to the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered by
Parent to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to _Section 3.07(a)_,
(iii) in the event that a Dispute Notice is delivered by the Stockholder
Representative to Parent prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the
Closing Statement delivered by Parent to the Stockholder Representative
pursuant to _Section 3.07(a)_, as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of
Parent and the Stockholder Representative in writing, or (iv) in the event
that a Dispute Notice is delivered by the Stockholder Representative to Parent
prior to the expiration of the Review Period and Parent and the Stockholder
Representative are unable to agree on all matters set forth in such Dispute
Notice, the Closing Statement delivered by Parent to the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to _Section 3.07(a)_, as adjusted by the Independent
Accountant to be consistent with (A) the Resolved Matters and (B) the
Independent Accountant's determination as to the calculation of the
Unresolved Matters in accordance with _Section 3.07(a)_ and _Section
3.07(c)_. The " _Final Aggregate Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Aggregate
Purchase Price as derived from the Final Closing Statement.

(e)  From and after the delivery of the Closing Statement by
Parent until the determination of the Final Closing Statement pursuant to
this _Section 3.07_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and shall
cause their respective subsidiaries to, permit the Stockholder Representative
and its Representatives reasonable access to the personnel, accountants and
properties of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, and provide
reasonable access (with the right to make copies), during business hours upon
reasonable advance notice, to all of the books, records, contracts and other
documents (including auditor's work papers) of the Surviving Corporation or
its subsidiaries only to the extent necessary to evaluate the calculations set
forth in the Closing Statement.

  



  

(f)   _Payment in Respect of Final Aggregate Purchase Price_.

  



  

(i)  If the Final Aggregate Purchase Price exceeds or is equal
to the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price, then within five (5) Business Days
after the final determination of the Final Closing Statement, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in immediately
available funds, with the Payments Administrator an amount in cash equal to
the full amount, if any, by which the Final Aggregate Purchase Price exceeds
the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price and, immediately thereafter, Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall provide a joint written instruction
to the Payments Administrator to deliver the applicable portions of such
amount to the applicable Equityholders (except that any amounts due to holders
of Company Options shall be remitted to Parent and paid to such holders
through payroll less any applicable required Tax withholding).

  



  

(ii)  If the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price exceeds the Final
Aggregate Purchase Price (such excess, the " _Overstatement_ "), Parent shall
be entitled to deduct the Overstatement from any amounts payable to the
applicable Equityholders (or to the Payments Administrator on their behalf)
pursuant to _Section 3.08_ of this Agreement and the Equityholders shall have
no further liability or obligations with respect to the Overstatement.
Parent's right to deduct the Overstatement pursuant to this
_Section 3.07(f)(ii)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
Parent against the Equityholders, or otherwise, with respect to any
adjustment pursuant to this _Section 3.07_.

  



  

(iii)  All payments pursuant to this _Section 3.07_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price for all
foreign, federal, state and local income Tax purposes unless otherwise
required by Law.

  



  

3.08   _Earn-Out Consideration_. As additional consideration for the
Merger, upon the achievement of certain milestones as further described
below, Parent shall, subject to the terms of this _Section 3.08_, pay the
Earn-Out Consideration to the applicable Equityholders as set forth on
_Schedule C_ under the heading "Earn-Out Consideration"; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that any amounts payable by Parent pursuant to this _Section 3.08_
shall be offset and reduced by any amounts deductible from payments to
Equityholders (or to the Payments Administrator on their behalf) pursuant to
this Agreement (including pursuant to _Article X,_ the Post-Closing Option
Payroll Taxes Offset and the Post-Closing Payments Administrator Fees).

(a)  Within five (5) Business Days of receipt of a Regulatory
Earn-Out Approval, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, in immediately available funds, with the Payments
Administrator the applicable Regulatory Earn-Out Consideration and,
immediately thereafter, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
provide a joint written instruction to the Payments Administrator to deliver
such amounts promptly to the applicable Equityholders as a Post-Closing
Payment in accordance with this Agreement (except that any amounts due to
holders of Company Options shall be remitted to Parent and paid to such
holders through payroll less any applicable required Tax withholding);
_provided_ that the applicable Regulatory Earn-Out Approval has been duly
obtained on or before the applicable Regulatory Approval Deadline. If a
Regulatory Earn-Out Approval is not obtained on or before the applicable
Regulatory Approval Deadline, no amount will be payable in respect of such
Regulatory Earn-Out Approval.

  



  

(b)  Within five (5) Business Days of the amount of Net Sales
for each of the years ending December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 becoming
conclusive, final and binding on all Parties, in accordance with this _Section
3.07_ , Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, in immediately available funds, with the Payments Administrator the
applicable amount of the Net Sales Earn-Out Consideration, if any, and,
immediately thereafter, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
provide a joint written instruction to the Payments Administrator to deliver
such amount promptly to the applicable Equityholders as a Post-Closing
Payment in accordance with this Agreement (except that any amounts due to
holders of Company Options shall be remitted to Parent and paid to such
holders through payroll less any applicable required Tax withholding).

  



  

(c)  Subject to the Stockholder Representative's ongoing
compliance with the Stockholder Representative NDA attached hereto as Annex
G, until April 30, 2022, Parent shall, within thirty (30) days following the
filing of its Form 10-Q or Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") (as applicable), prepare and deliver to the
Stockholder Representative a good faith calculation of the total Net Sales of
each class of Company Products in the applicable calendar quarter in the form
set forth on _Schedule H_ (a " _Parent Earn-Out Statement_ "), together with,
for the Parent Earn-Out Statements delivered immediately following the filing
of its Form 10-K for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 only, a statement as to
whether any Net Sales Earn-Out Consideration is payable in connection
therewith and if so, the amount thereof; provided that the reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed or furnished by Parent
with or to the SEC shall be deemed to satisfy this reporting obligation if
such information is disclosed therein. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the Parent Earn-Out Statement, and the component items and calculations
therein, shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the terms
(including the definitions) of this Agreement. Following the filing of its
Form 10-K in respect of both calendar year 2020 and 2021, if requested by the
Stockholder Representative, Parent agrees that at least one of the Parent
Executives will meet with the Stockholder Representative to discuss the
Parent Earn-Out Statement and provide additional information that Parent, in
its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

(d)  If the Stockholder Representative disputes the calculation
of Net Sales set forth in the Parent Earn-Out Statement, then the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver to Parent a written notice (an " _Earn-Out
Dispute Notice_ ") of any disputes or objections thereto (collectively, the "
_Earn-Out Disputed Items_ ") with reasonable supporting detail as to such
Earn-Out Disputed Items within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of the
Parent Earn-Out Statement (such period, the " _Earn-Out Review Period_ ").

  



  

(e)  If the Stockholder Representative fails to deliver to
Parent an Earn-Out Dispute Notice prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out
Review Period or otherwise earlier notifies Parent in writing that the
Stockholder Representative has no disputes or objections to the Parent Earn-
Out Statement, the amount of Net Sales set forth in the Parent Earn-Out
Statement shall be conclusive, final and binding on all Parties absent
manifest error.

  



  

(f)  Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall, for a
period of ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as Parent and the
Stockholder Representative may agree in writing) following delivery of an
Earn-Out Dispute Notice to Parent (the " _Earn-Out Resolution Period_ "),
attempt in good faith to resolve their differences, and any such resolution
by them as to any Earn-Out Disputed Items shall be conclusive, final and
binding on all Parties absent manifest error. Any Earn-Out Disputed Items
agreed to by Parent and the Stockholder Representative in writing, together
with any items or calculations set forth in the Parent Earn-Out Statement not
disputed or objected to by the Stockholder Representative in the Earn-Out
Dispute Notice, are collectively referred to herein as the " _Earn-Out
Resolved Matters_ ". Any Earn-Out Resolved Matters shall be conclusive, final
and binding on all Parties absent manifest error, except to the extent such
component could be affected by other components of the calculations set forth
in the Parent Earn-Out Statement that are the subject of an Earn-Out Dispute
Notice. If at the end of the Earn-Out Resolution Period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative have been unable to resolve any differences that
they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Earn-Out Dispute
Notice, either of Parent or the Stockholder Representative may, upon written
notice to the other, refer all matters that remain in dispute with respect to
the Dispute Notice to be exclusively and definitively resolved, without any
recourse to appeal, by final and binding arbitration pursuant to _Section
3.08(g)_.

  



  

(g)  Any Earn-Out Arbitration shall be instituted and conducted
in, and its seat shall be, the city of New York, New York, where the
arbitration award shall be rendered. The arbitration shall be administered by
the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce (" _ICC_ ") in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC ("
_Arbitration Rules_ "), as in effect as of the date of commencement of the
arbitration, as modified by this Agreement or mutual agreement of the
Parties. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language, though
documents or testimony may be submitted in other languages if a translation
is provided. The arbitration panel shall be composed of three (3) arbitrators.
The first (1st) arbitrator shall be nominated by the claimant and the second
(2nd) arbitrator shall be nominated by the respondent, each in accordance
with Article 12(4) of the Arbitration Rules. The third (3rd) arbitrator (who
shall act as chairman) shall be appointed by the two (2) party-appointed
arbitrators, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of confirmation
of the second (2nd) party-appointed arbitrator. If any party fails to appoint
an arbitrator within the required period, or if the two (2) arbitrators cannot
reach an agreement with respect to the third (3rd) arbitrator within the
applicable period, the appointment shall be made by the ICC International
Court of Arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Rules. To the extent that an
Earn-Out Arbitration involves more than one (1) party as claimant, such
claimants shall jointly appoint the first (1st) arbitrator. To the extent that
an Earn-Out Arbitration involves more than one (1) respondent, such
respondents shall jointly appoint the second (2nd) arbitrator. The
Parties consent to the consolidation of arbitrations commenced hereunder
pursuant to the Arbitration Rules. Any award of the arbitration panel must be
in writing and state the grounds upon which it is based (in each case, a "
_Final Award_ "). The Final Award shall be conclusive, final and binding on
the Parties and their successors, and a judgment upon the Final Award may be
recognized and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fees and
expenses of the arbitration and other reasonable and documented costs of the
party which has prevailed in such arbitration (the " _Arbitration Fees_ "),
including reasonable attorney's fees, shall be borne as established by the
arbitration panel. The Arbitration Fees payable by Parent (if any) shall be
paid directly by Parent, and the Arbitration Fees payable by the Stockholder
Representative (if any, solely on behalf of the Equityholders) shall be paid
from the Expense Fund. To the extent the Expense Fund is insufficient or
unavailable to cover all of the Arbitration Fees payable by the Stockholder
Representative, Parent shall pay any such remaining Arbitration Fees and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct such amounts from any amounts payable to
the applicable Equityholders (or to the Payments Administrator on their
behalf) pursuant to _Section 3.07_ or this _Section 3.08_ of this Agreement.

(h)   _Parent Actions_. Until December 31, 2021, subject to
Applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Regulatory Earn-Out
Approvals and not take any action that was specifically intended by any
Parent Executive to avoid the payment of any Net Sales Earn-Out Consideration
or any Regulatory Earn-Out Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing is not intended to, and shall not, restrict in any manner
Parent's ability to, in its sole discretion, make decisions in the ordinary
course with respect to the operation of the Company, including: (i) decisions
to hire, fire, replace, substitute or change the role of any employees,
suppliers or distributors; combine office locations and back office support
functions; and comply with Parent's global compliance and human resource
policies; (ii) to comply with Applicable Law and (iii) to comply with any
express requirements of this Agreement. Any dispute arising out of, resulting
from or in connection with this _Section 3.08(h)_ shall be exclusively and
definitively resolved, without any recourse to appeal, by final and binding
arbitration pursuant to _Section 3.08(g)_.

  



  

(i)   _Enforcement of Earn-Out Covenant_. The right and power
to enforce this _Section 3.08_ against Parent shall reside entirely with the

(a)  The Company agrees that neither it nor any of the officers
and directors of it shall, and that none of its Representatives shall,
directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any Person

(b)   _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Except to the extent required by the directors' fiduciary duties
prior to the time Written Consents constituting the Required Stockholder
Approval have been delivered to Parent, the Company's board of directors and

(or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Board Recommendation.

  



  

(c)   _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,

negotiation are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the material
financial terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including

6.05   _Required Stockholder Approval_. In accordance with Applicable
Laws, including Section 228, Section 251(c) and Section 262 of the Delaware
Law, and the Company's Organizational Documents, immediately following the
execution of this Agreement and the mailing of the Information Statement, the
Company shall seek and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as
promptly as practicable, and in any event, by midnight on January 5, 2020,
(the " _Initial Stockholder Support Delivery Period_ ") Support Agreements
from the Stockholders holding a number of shares of Company Capital Stock
sufficient to satisfy the Required Stockholder Approval in lieu of a meeting
pursuant to Section 228 of the Delaware Law for the purposes of (a) adopting
this Agreement and approving the Merger and (b) acknowledging that the
adoption and approvals are irrevocable and result in the waiver of any right
of such stockholders to demand appraisal in connection with the Merger
pursuant to the Delaware Law. As promptly as practicable and, in any event,
prior to the expiration of the Initial Stockholder Support Delivery
Period, if Support Agreements sufficient to constitute the Required
Stockholder Approval are duly executed and delivered to the Company, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a copy thereof (including by facsimile or
other electronic image scan transmission), certified as correct and complete
by an executive officer of the Company.

  



  

6.06   _Additional Stockholder Consents_. After the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to have Written Consents executed and delivered by Stockholders
such that Stockholders holding at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall have executed and
delivered Written Consents prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

6.07   _Information Statement_. Within five (5) days of the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall prepare (with the cooperation of Parent)
and mail to each holder of Company Capital Stock an information statement
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which shall be in
a form reasonably acceptable to Parent (as it may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Information Statement_ "). The
Information Statement shall constitute an information statement for the
Company's solicitation of consent of the holders of Company Capital Stock with
respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and
a notice of the availability of appraisal rights under Delaware Law and shall
include (a) a statement to the effect that the Company's board of directors
had unanimously recommended that the holders of Company Capital Stock vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger, (b) a
statement that adoption of this Agreement shall constitute, among other
things, approval by the holders of Company Capital Stock of the Expense Fund
by the Stockholder Representative and the withholding of the Special
Indemnity Holdback and (c) such other information as Parent and the Company
reasonably agree is required or advisable under Applicable Laws to be
included therein. The Company shall, with the cooperation of Parent (to
the extent reasonably required), prepare any other necessary documentation
required or advisable to be provided to holders of Company Capital Stock
pursuant to the Delaware Law. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or the Company for inclusion in the Information Statement
or any amendment or supplement thereto will contain, as of the date of the
delivery of such document, any untrue statement of a material fact, or will
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

6.08   _Employees; Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a)  For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent will, or will cause an Affiliate to,
provide to each Continuing Employee for so long as such Continuing Employee
remains an employee of Parent or its Affiliates during the Continuation
Period (i) base salary or regular hourly wage and target annual cash
bonus opportunities that are each no less favorable than the base salary or
regular hourly wage and target annual cash bonus opportunities, respectively,
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) retirement and welfare benefits (excluding any defined benefit
plan benefits) that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall honor each Continuing Employee's accrued, unused vacation
balances as of the Closing Date, and allow the Continuing Employees to use
such vacation after the Closing Date, in accordance with Parent's applicable
policies.

  



  

(b)  Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting
periods under any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived
with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, and
(ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket
limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for
which payment has been made. Parent shall give each Continuing Employee
service credit for such Continuing Employee's employment with the Company for
purposes of vesting, benefit accrual, level of benefits and eligibility to
participate under each applicable Parent benefit plan (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, does not include any equity incentive plan), as if such
service had been performed with Parent, except for benefit accrual under
defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for
subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits.

  



  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in
writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause the Company's 401(k) plan to be terminated effective no
later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that
Parent requests that the Company's 401(k) plan be terminated, the Company
shall provide Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the
form and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable review and comment
by Parent) no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

  



  

(d)  Prior to delivering or making any written or oral
communications to the directors, officers or employees of the
Company pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy summarizing the intended communications for Parent's
approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e)  (i) If required, within seven (7) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time (and provided that within nine (9) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time, Parent has fully and timely disclosed any potential
"parachute payment" (as defined below) to any disqualified individual (as
defined below) pursuant to any agreement or arrangement between any such
disqualified individual and Parent (or its applicable Affiliate)), the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
be irrevocably waived by each of the applicable "disqualified individuals"
(as defined under Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder) the right to any payments that would reasonably be expected to
constitute a "parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (each,
a " _Parachute Payment_ ") and (ii) at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall submit for approval by holders of
Company Capital Stock, in conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations thereunder (the " _280G Stockholder Vote_ "), any Parachute
Payments. The disclosure and documents that comprise the 280G Stockholder
Vote shall be prepared by the Company and Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and provide reasonable comment, which the
Company shall consider in good faith.

  



  

(f)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take the
actions set forth on _Section 6.08(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(g)  Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Company Plan, (ii) prevent Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or
terminating any of their benefit plans or, after the Effective Time, any
Company Plan in accordance with its terms, (iii) prevent Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from
terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee, or (iv) create
any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company, any
beneficiary or dependent thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any
Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

  



  

6.09   _Third-Party Consents_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) obtain prior to the Closing, and (ii) deliver to
Parent at or prior to the Closing, all consents, waivers and approvals under
each Contract listed or described in _Section 6.09_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

6.10   _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Tax Returns_. The Stockholder Representative shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and Parent shall file or cause to be filed,
all Tax Returns that reflect any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Tax Returns for Straddle Periods) required to be filed by
or on behalf of the Company after the Closing Date that have an initial due
date after the Closing Date (assuming for such purpose that, if a valid
extension is obtained, the initial due date is the extended due date) to the
extent not already filed prior to the Closing Date (each, a " _Pre-Closing Tax
Return_ "). Such Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices of the Company unless otherwise required
by Applicable Laws and, if applicable, shall reflect the provisions of
_Section 6.10(h)_. The Stockholder Representative shall provide Parent with a
copy of each such proposed Pre-Closing Tax Return (and such additional
information regarding such Pre-Closing Tax Return as may reasonably be
requested by Parent) at least thirty (30) days before filing for Parent's
review and comment. Parent shall have fifteen (15) days following receipt of
any such Pre-Closing Tax Return to provide to the Stockholder
Representative any written comments to such Pre-Closing Tax Return, and
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any dispute regarding any such comments. If Parent and the Stockholder
Representative are unable to resolve any such dispute within a five (5) day
period, such dispute shall be referred to the Independent Accountant for
resolution. Each Party shall use its reasonable efforts to furnish to the
Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents and information
pertaining to the unresolved items as the Independent Accountant may request.
All communications between Parent and Stockholder Representative, on the one
hand, and the Independent Accountant, on the other hand, will be in writing
with copies simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating Party. The
Independent Accountant shall make a written determination as to the dispute
within a reasonable time after the same is submitted to the Independent
Accountant (taking into account the due date of the applicable Pre-
Closing Tax Return), which determination shall be conclusive, final and
binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If during the process of
resolving a dispute concerning a Pre-Closing Tax Return such Pre-Closing Tax
Return becomes due (taking into account valid extensions, which shall be
obtained if available), then the Surviving Corporation may file such Pre-
Closing Tax Return or cause such Pre-Closing Tax Return to be filed
reflecting any changes that were agreed upon prior to filing. If as a result
of the resolution of the dispute by the Independent Accountant it is
determined that such Pre-Closing Tax Return should have been
prepared differently, such Pre-Closing Tax Return shall be amended and
refiled accordingly. The costs and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be borne by the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf
of the Equityholders) and the Parent in a manner consistent with _Section
3.07_.

(b)   _Audits and Contests Regarding Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods_. Any Party who receives, or whose Affiliate receives, any notice of
a pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment or adjustment or other
proceeding related to Taxes against or with respect to the Company that
relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Return or Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall promptly notify the other Parties in writing within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of such notice. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative each agree to consult with and to keep the other
informed on a regular basis regarding the status of any such proceeding. The
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to conduct and control any
such proceeding and to employ counsel of its choice at the Equityholders'
sole expense in such proceeding, and to control the disposition of any issue
involved in such proceeding to the extent such proceeding relates to or
affects Pre-Closing Tax Returns or Taxes of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a Straddle Period); provided
that Parent shall have the right to participate in such proceeding through
counsel of its choice at its own expense. To the extent inconsistent
therewith, the provisions of this _Section 6.10(b)_ shall supersede the
provisions of _Section 10.03_.

  



  

(c)   _Tax Cooperation_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Stockholder Representative shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
cooperate following the Closing, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other party, in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Company
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a
Straddle Period), including filing Tax Returns and in resolving Tax-related
disputes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
party's request) the prompt provision of records and information relating to
Taxes of the Company (and the right to make copies thereof), making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (and each of their respective Affiliates) agree to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the later of (i) seven years and
(ii) 120 days after the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Tax Authority.

(d)   _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other similar Taxes (including penalties and interest) incurred solely as a
result of the Merger (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by Parent. Parent
shall prepare and file any returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.
The Parties agree to cooperate in such preparation and filing of Tax Returns,
including by promptly supplying any information in its possession that is
reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

  



  

(e)   _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All written Contracts providing
for allocation, sharing or indemnification with respect to Taxes (other than
Contracts not primarily related to Taxes which were entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business, including without limitation credit or loan
agreements, vendor agreements, purchase and sale agreements and leases) to
which the Company is a party and pursuant to which the Company may have any
obligations or responsibilities with respect to Taxes shall be
terminated prior to the Closing, and the Company shall have no further
obligations or responsibilities thereunder following the Closing.

  



  

(f)   _Amended Tax Returns_.

  



  

(i)  Except pursuant to _Section 6.10(a)_ or _Section
6.10(f)(ii)_ , neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall, and
neither shall cause or permit any of their Affiliates to, amend, file, re-
file, make, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election
(including changing a method of accounting) of the Company with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Straddle
Period). Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their
Affiliates shall initiate or enter into any voluntary disclosure program or
similar process, or voluntarily initiate discussion with a Tax Authority,
with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or file any Tax Return of the Company with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period in a jurisdiction in which the Company had not
previously filed Tax Returns.

  



  

(ii)  Notwithstanding _Section 6.10(f)(i)_ , Parent or the
Surviving Corporation may take an action described in _Section 6.10(f)(i)_ if
Parent satisfies the requirements of this _Section 6.10(f)(ii)_. If Parent
determines that authority exists to support taking an action described in
_Section 6.10(f)(i)_ that satisfies a "more likely than not" standard (or
higher standard), Parent may prepare draft documentation or memoranda with
respect to or to effectuate such action (and which documentation or
memoranda, for the avoidance of doubt, support such standard) and shall submit
such to the Stockholder Representative for review and comment. Parent shall
not take any such action if the Stockholder Representative asserts in writing
with documentation that reasonably supports such assertion within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of Parent's materials that there does not
exist authority that satisfies a "more likely than not" standard (or higher
standard) with respect to such action.  In the event of such disagreement,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall attempt in good faith to
resolve such disagreement.  If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are
unable to resolve any such disagreement within a five (5) day period, such
dispute shall be referred to the Independent Accountant for resolution. Each
Party shall use its reasonable efforts to furnish to the Independent
Accountant such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to
the dispute as the Independent Accountant may request. All communications
between Parent and the Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, and the
Independent Accountant, on the other hand, will be in writing with copies
simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating Party. The
Independent Accountant shall make a written determination as to the dispute
within a reasonable time after the same is submitted to the
Independent Accountant, which determination shall be conclusive, final and
binding on the Parties for all purposes hereunder. The costs and expenses of
the Independent Accountant shall be borne by the Stockholder Representative
(solely on behalf of the Equityholders) and the Parent in a manner consistent
with _Section 3.07_.

(g)   _Refunds_. Any Tax refunds (and interest, if any, received
thereon) or benefit of crediting an overpayment (and interest, if any,
received thereon) of Taxes that are received by or credited to Parent, its
Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation with respect to Taxes with respect to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be paid by Parent to the Stockholder
Representative within fifteen (15) Business Days after actual receipt or
benefit thereof. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any
losses, deductions and credits of the Company relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period to first offset income and gain in the period or portion thereof to
which they relate and thereafter carry them back to prior periods to the
maximum extent permitted by Law prior to being carried forward.

  



  

(h)   _Deductions for Expenses_. The Parties agree that payments
made with respect to Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses, and
consideration paid pursuant to this Agreement with respect to Company Options,
to the extent such payments give rise to Tax deductions, Tax losses and Tax
credits or otherwise may offset taxable income or Tax under Applicable Law,
shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, be considered to
arise in a Pre-Closing Tax Period and the provisions of this Agreement shall
be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent therewith (including the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to _Section 6.10(a)_ ). The
Surviving Corporation shall make the election described in Section 4 of
Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 IRB 746 with respect to any success-based
fees incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including for purposes of filing Tax Returns pursuant to _Section
6.10(a)_ ).

  



  

(i)   _Closing Date Items/No Section 338 Election_. None of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates shall make or
permit or cause to be made any extraordinary transactions or events on the
Closing Date with respect to the Company that would result in any increased
liability with respect to Taxes for which any Equityholder would be
responsible or would economically bear (through payment, indemnification,
reduction in consideration to be received, or otherwise). None of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates shall file or permit or
cause to be filed any election under Section 338 or Section 336 of the Code
(or comparable provision of other Law) with respect to transactions described
pursuant to this Agreement.

6.11   _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from time to
time after the Closing, each of the Parties hereto shall execute and deliver
such other documents and instruments, provide such materials and information
and take such other actions as may reasonably be necessary, proper or
advisable, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

6.12   _Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Directors ' and
Officers' Insurance, etc_. Parent agrees that, subject to Applicable Laws,
all rights to indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in
favor of the Indemnified Directors and Officers (as provided in (i) the
Company's Organizational Documents and (ii) any other indemnification
agreements (as applicable) as in effect as of the date of this Agreement)
with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter,
without any amendment thereto.

  



  

(a)  If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the

Fraud by any Stockholder, neither the Equityholders, the Stockholder
Representative nor any of their respective Representatives shall be liable to
the insurer under the RandW Policy for subrogation claims pursuant to the RandW
Policy, and Parent covenants and agrees that the RandW Policy will include a
waiver of such subrogation claims (other than in the case of Fraud by any
Stockholder) for the benefit of the Equityholders, the Stockholder
Representative and their respective Representatives. From and after the
issuance and binding of the RandW Policy, Parent shall not (and shall cause its
Affiliates to not) terminate the RandW Policy or amend, modify, supplement,
terminate or waive any provision of the RandW Policy, including regarding
waiver of subrogation, without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative. Parent shall cause the RandW Policy, when issued and bound, to
be consistent in all material respects with the Binder Agreement.

Article X 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

10.01   _Survival_.

  



  

(a)  The representations and warranties of the Parties contained
in or made pursuant to _Article IV_ and _Article V_ shall survive in full
force and effect until the date that is twelve (12) months from the Closing
Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company Fundamental Representations
and the Parent Fundamental Representations and the representations and
warranties contained in or made pursuant to _Section 4.16_ shall survive in
full force and effect until the date that is six (6) years from the Closing
Date and the representations and warranties contained in or made pursuant to
_Section 4.12_ shall survive in full force and effect until the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations, taking into account any
tolling periods and other extensions; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent
shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates (including the Company)
to waive or extend any such statute of limitations without the consent of the
Stockholder Representative (each such survival period, a " _Representations
Survival Period_ "). All covenants of the Parties shall survive until
performed. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby agree and
acknowledge that a Representations Survival Period is a contractual statute
of limitations that may be shorter than the statute of limitations otherwise
available under Applicable Law and any claim brought by any Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Article X_ must be brought or filed prior to the
expiration of the applicable Representations Survival Period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if written notice of a claim has been given pursuant to and in
accordance with this _Article X_ prior to the expiration of the applicable
Representations Survival Period by the Person seeking indemnification for
such claim, then the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements with
respect to which such claim alleges a breach shall survive solely as and to
the extent of such claim and only until such claim has been finally resolved
pursuant to this _Article X_ and only for purposes of such resolution. Nothing
contained in this _Section 10.01_ shall affect the rights of Parent under
the RandW Policy.

  



  

(b)  This _Article X_ shall survive the Closing and shall remain
in effect (i) with respect to _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ and _Section
10.02(b)(i)_, only so long as and until the relevant representations and
warranties survive, (ii) with respect to _Section 10.02(a)(ii)_ and _Section
10.02(b)(ii)_, only so long as and until the relevant covenants are fully
performed, and (iii) with respect to _Section 10.02(a)(iii)_ only until sixty
(60) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations (including all
applicable periods of extension) with respect to any claim arising thereunder.

  



  

(c)  Notice of any assertion by any Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party is liable to it pursuant to _Section 10.02_ must be given
to the Indemnifying Party in writing on or prior to the time of expiration of
the relevant representation, warranty or covenant as set forth in this
_Section 10.01_ or such claim will be forever barred. Any Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification hereunder shall state the facts known to the
asserting Indemnified Party that give rise to such notice in
sufficient detail to allow the Indemnifying Party to evaluate the assertion,
along with the amount of Losses to the extent known, or a good faith
reasonable estimate of the Losses, and method of computation thereof. With
respect to any recovery or indemnification sought by an Indemnified Party
from an Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, it
shall so notify the Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnity Dispute Notice_ "),
and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good
faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute. If the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party cannot resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Indemnity Dispute Notice, such dispute may be resolved
by litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with
_Section 11.16_.

harmless Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates and Representatives,
successors and permitted assigns (the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any liabilities, losses, Actions, investigations, judgments, orders,
damages, expenses or costs, including reasonable out of pocket attorneys'
fees and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ " and, individually, a " _Loss_
"), that any of the foregoing suffers as a result of:

  



  

(i)  any breach of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement or any failure of any
such representation or warranty to be true and correct as of and as though
made on the Closing Date (other than those expressly given as of a specified
date prior to the date of this Agreement, for which the breach shall be
determined as of such specified date);

  



  

(ii)  any breach by the Company of any of the covenants or
agreements of the Company set forth in this Agreement required by this
Agreement to be performed or complied with by the Company at or before the
Closing;

the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

10.03   _Third-Party Claims_. Except as provided otherwise in _Section
6.10(b)_ , the obligations and liabilities of an Indemnifying Party with
respect to Losses resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties
resulting from breaches or failures pursuant to _Section 10.02_ (other than
_Section 10.02(a)(iii)_ and _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ with respect to breaches of
_Section 4.12_ ) (each, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions:

  



  

(a)  The Indemnified Parties shall promptly give written notice
to the Indemnifying Parties of any Third-Party Claim that might give rise to
any Loss by the Indemnified Parties, stating the nature and basis of such
Third-Party Claim, and the amount thereof to the extent known, or a good-
faith reasonable estimate of the Losses, and the method of computation of such
Losses; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, so long as such written notice is
given on or prior to the time of expiration of the relevant
representation, warranty or covenant as set forth in _Section 10.01_ , no
delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation
hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.
Such notice shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with
respect to such Third-Party Claim, including any summons, complaint or other
pleading that may have been served, any written demand or any other document
or instrument.

  



  

(b)  From and after receipt of notice of a Third-Party Claim
pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)_, the Indemnifying Parties shall have the
right to assume and conduct, at their own expense, the defense against the
Third-Party Claim in their own names or in the names of the Indemnified
Parties. Any Indemnified Parties shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such Third-Party Claim and/or to participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be included as
part of any Loss incurred by the Indemnified Party and shall not be payable by
the Indemnifying Parties. The Party or Parties conducting the defense of any
Third-Party Claim shall keep the other Parties apprised of all significant
developments with respect thereto and shall not enter into any settlement,
compromise or consent to judgment with respect to such Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle,
compromise or consent to a judgment without the consent of the Indemnified
Party with respect to a Third-Party Claim that only imposes monetary
obligations that are paid by the Indemnifying Party and contains a release of
the Indemnified Party from all liability thereunder. The Indemnified Party
shall make available all information and assistance reasonably available and
necessary for the defense of the Third-Party Claim as the Indemnifying Party
may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
defense. The Stockholder Representative shall be the sole party entitled to

under this _Section 10.03_.

(a)  The sole and exclusive source of recovery for
indemnification available to any Parent Indemnified Parties shall be (i)

the Payments Administrator on their behalf) pursuant to _Section 3.07_ or
_Section 3.08_ of this Agreement, with such deduction not being greater, in
the aggregate, than the RandW Retention Amount (the " _Earn-Out Indemnification
Deduction_ "), (ii) second (for the avoidance of doubt, only after having
reached the amount available pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence), the RandW
Policy to the extent covered thereby, (iii) third, (A) solely in respect of
any claims for breaches of Company Fundamental Representations or claims
resulting from Fraud by or on behalf of the Company (collectively, the "
_Special Losses_ ") (and for the avoidance of doubt, only after having
reached the amount available pursuant to clause (ii) of this sentence),
either, at Parent's option, (1) from each Stockholder for their
Indemnification Pro Rata Share of the Special Losses or (2) by making
deductions from any amounts payable to Stockholders (or to the Payments
Administrator on their behalf) pursuant to _Section 3.07_ or _Section
3.08;_ (B) solely in respect of any claims for breaches of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 4.12_ or
claims pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)(iii)_ (and for the avoidance of doubt,
only after having reached the amount available pursuant to clause (ii) of
this sentence) by making deductions from any amounts payable to Stockholders
(or to the Payments Administrator on their behalf) pursuant to _Section
3.07_ or _Section 3.08_; _provided_ that in no event shall such Stockholder
be liable for any amount in excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration
actually received by such Stockholder as of the time of such indemnifiable
claim; _provided_ , _further_ , that any limitation of liability in this
_Section 10.04(a)_ with respect to a Stockholder shall not apply in the case
of Fraud committed by such Stockholder; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Earn-Out Indemnification Deduction will not be decreased by any other
deductions made to amounts paid to Stockholders (or to the Payments
Administrator on their behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, other than in the
cases of Special Losses, in no event will any Parent Indemnified Party be
entitled to recover for any indemnification claim from any Stockholder.

in no event will (i) the Stockholders be liable for any amounts taken into
account in the calculation of Final Aggregate Purchase Price (including any
amounts included in Closing Indebtedness), (ii) the Stockholders be liable
more than once in respect of the same Loss (notwithstanding that such Loss may
result from more than one of the occurrences specified in _Section 10.02_ )
or (iii) any Stockholder be liable hereunder for any amount in excess of the
Per Share Merger Consideration actually received by such Stockholder, except
with respect to Fraud committed by such Stockholder.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
other than in the case of any claims resulting from Fraud by or on behalf of
the Company (which shall be considered Special Losses for purposes of this
_Section 10.04_ ), with respect to any Special Indemnity Losses, the sole and
exclusive source of recovery for indemnification shall be the then-remaining
balance of the Special Indemnity Holdback.

  



  

(d)  Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder or
otherwise to reimbursement for Losses in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall use all reasonable efforts to mitigate
all Losses upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or
recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith; _provided_ , _however_ , any
and all such direct and indirect costs and expenses related to such
mitigation may be included with the Losses for which indemnification may be
sought under this _Article X_.

(e)  The right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other
remedies based on any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered with respect
hereto will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to,
or any knowledge or information acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any
Party at any time (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any disclosures
set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule), whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

  



  

(f)  With respect to the Parent Indemnified Parties, Losses
shall not include (1) in respect of _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ Taxes with respect
to taxable periods or portions thereof beginning after the Closing Date,
except Taxes attributable to a breach of the representations set forth in
_Section 4.12(d)_ , _Section 4.12(g)_ , _Section 4.12(h)_ and _Section
4.12(i)_  and (2) Taxes that are due to the unavailability in any taxable
period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date of any net
operating losses or other Tax attributes from a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(g)  For purposes of this _Article X_ , any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be determined, and the
resulting determination of any Losses shall be calculated, without regard to
any "materiality," "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar
materiality qualification with respect thereto; provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to _Section 4.08(b)_ or the terms "Material Contract",
"Material Contracts", and "Material Product and Trial Information".

  



  

(h)  The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article X_
will be determined net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party under indemnification agreements or arrangements with third parties or
under insurance policies with respect to such Losses. If any Indemnified
Party shall recover any duplicate Losses pursuant to indemnification
agreements or arrangements with third parties or under insurance policies or
otherwise subsequent to recovering corresponding Losses from the
Stockholders pursuant to this _Article X_ , such Indemnified Party shall
promptly reimburse and deliver the amount of such duplicate recovery to the
Payments Administrator, and, immediately thereafter, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the
Payments Administrator to deliver such amount promptly to the applicable
Stockholders in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

10.05   _No Contribution_. No Indemnifying Party or any of its employees
or agents shall have any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
right or remedy against the Company in connection with any indemnification
obligation or any other liability to which they may become subject under or
in connection with this Agreement in their capacity as a Stockholder.

  



  

10.06   _Remedies Exclusive_. The indemnification rights of the
Indemnified Parties under this _Article X_ are the sole and exclusive
remedies after the Closing available to the Indemnified Parties with respect
to any claims or disputes arising between the Indemnified Parties and
Indemnifying Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the business of the Company, except as specified in this
_Article X_ with respect to Fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained herein shall affect the rights of the Parties under (a) _Section
11.14_ with respect to any covenants to be performed by the Parties, (b)
_Section 3.07_ or (c) _Section 3.08_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that
nothing contained in this _Section 10.06_ shall affect the rights of Parent
under the RandW Policy.

10.07   _Adjustment Characterization_. The Parties agree to treat any
payment made pursuant to this _Article X_  after the Closing as an adjustment
to the Aggregate Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Laws.

  



  

10.08   _Damage Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no Person shall be liable under this _Article X_
for any punitive or exemplary damages other than any such damages that are
recovered by a third party that is not an Affiliate of the applicable
Indemnified Party in connection with a Third-Party Claim.

  



  

Article XI 
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

11.01   _Stockholder Representative_ 

  



  

(a)  The adoption of this Agreement by the Required Stockholder
Approval, and the receipt of the benefits hereof, including the right to
receive consideration payable in connection with the Merger, shall
automatically and without any further action on the part of any Equityholder
constitute the irrevocable appointment of Boston Millennia Partners Button
Shareholder Representation, Inc. as the representative, agent, proxy and
attorney-in-fact for each of the Equityholders with respect to matters arising
after the effectiveness of the Merger and for all purposes in connection with
this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto to be performed by the
Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative hereby represents
and warrants to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company that, as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date, Martin J. Hernon is the sole stockholder,
director and officer of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative does not have any employees.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting _Section 11.01(a)_, the Stockholder
Representative is hereby irrevocably appointed the representative, agent,
proxy and attorney-in-fact for each of the Equityholders for all purposes of
this Agreement and the Payments Administrator Agreement, including full and
sole power and authority on such Equityholders' behalf, and in lieu of each
Equityholder having the ability to take any of the following actions
directly, to, after the Closing, (i) give and receive notices
and communications, (ii) object to such deliveries, (iii) make and settle
claims on behalf of the Stockholders pursuant to _Article X_ and
Equityholders pursuant to _Section 3.07_ and _Section 3.08_ , (iv) agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of, courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such claims, (v) take all actions necessary under _Section 6.10_, (vi)
execute any instrument or document that the Stockholder Representative may
determine is necessary or desirable in the exercise of its authority under
this _Section 11.01_ and the Payments Administrator Agreement, and (vii)
take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Stockholder Representative will have no obligation to
act on behalf of the Equityholders, except as expressly provided herein. In
connection with the carrying out of its duties, the Stockholder
Representative shall have the full and complete authority to incur reasonable
expenses and engage counsel, advisors and experts. The Stockholder
Representative may resign at any time with ten (10) days' prior written
notice. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled
by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the appointment
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new
Stockholder Representative. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder
Representative. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholder Representative after the Closing shall constitute notice to or
from each of the Equityholders.

  



  

   

-64-

(c)  The Stockholder Representative will incur no liability of
any kind with respect to any action or omission by the Stockholder
Representative in connection with the Stockholder Representative's services
pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the
event of liability directly resulting from the Stockholder Representative's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall
not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel.
The Equityholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder
Representative from and against any and all Losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel, advisors and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and
shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in
connection with the Stockholder Representative's execution and performance of
this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ that in the event
that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the
Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent
attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid
directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Equityholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from
the funds in (i) the Expense Fund and (ii) the amounts in the Special
Indemnity Holdback, each at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be
distributable to the applicable Equityholders; _provided_  that while this
_Section 11.01_ allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the
aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Equityholders from
their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at Law or otherwise. In no event will
the Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf
of the Equityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or
indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse against
non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Equityholders set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided
to the Stockholder Representative under this _Section 11.01_. The foregoing
indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the
Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement. Upon the
Closing, Parent will wire to the Stockholder Representative an aggregate cash
amount of $200,000 (the " _Expense Fund Amount_ "), such amount to constitute
an expense fund (the " _Expense Fund_ "), which will be used for the purposes
of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholder Representative for, any
third-party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the Payments
Administrator Agreement. The Equityholders will not receive any interest or
earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative will not
be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder
Representative shall have sole control of withdrawals from, or other
decisions with respect to, the Expense Fund but acknowledges that it will hold
these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for
its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. Contemporaneous with or as soon as practicable following the
completion of the Stockholder Representative's responsibilities, the
Stockholder Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the Expense
Fund to the Payments Administrator, for further payment of such balance as a
Post-Closing Payment (except that any amounts due to holders of Company
Options shall be remitted to Parent and paid to such holders through payroll
less any applicable required Tax withholding). For tax purposes, the Expense
Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the
applicable Equityholders at the time of Closing.

11.02   _Actions of the Stockholder Representative_. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative shall constitute a
decision of all Equityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each such Equityholder, and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each and every such Equityholder. Parent is hereby
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative.

  



  

11.03   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior
discussions and agreements among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof, excluding the Non-Disclosure Agreement, and, together with the
Non-Disclosure Agreement, contains the sole and entire agreement among the
Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Non-Disclosure
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

  



  

11.04   _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, each Party will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation, execution and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

  



  

11.05   _Announcements_. No press or other public announcement, or public
statement or comment in response to any inquiry, relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the terms hereof shall be issued or made by
any Party without the prior review and joint approval of the other Parties
(other than the Stockholder Representative); _provided_ that a press release
or other public announcement, regulatory filing, statement or comment made
without such prior review and joint approval shall not be in violation of
this _Section 11.05_ if it is made in order for the disclosing Party or any
of its Affiliates to comply with Applicable Laws or stock exchange rules and
in the reasonable judgment of the Party making such release or
announcement, based upon advice of outside counsel, prior review and joint
approval, despite reasonable efforts to obtain the same, would
prevent dissemination of such release or announcement in a sufficiently
timely fashion to comply with such Applicable Laws or rules; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that in all instances prompt notice from one Party to the others
shall be given with respect to any such release, announcement, statement or
comment. Each Party shall inform its Affiliates that may be involved in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the requirements set forth in
this _Section 11.05_ and shall make reasonable efforts to obtain
compliance with the provisions of this _Section 11.05_ from such Affiliates.

11.06   _No Waiver_. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise and
no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right,
remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of
such right, remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement
preclude any other or further exercise of any such right, remedy, power or
privilege or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided in this Agreement are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by Applicable Law.

  



  

11.07   _Amendments_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended,
modified, supplemented or waived only by an instrument in writing duly
executed by, if executed prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Company,
Merger Sub and the Stockholder Representative, and if executed after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Stockholder Representative. Any such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver shall be for such period and subject to
such conditions as shall be specified in the instrument effecting the same
and shall be binding upon the Parties, and any such waiver shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the purposes for which given.

  



  

11.08   _Addresses for Notices_. All notices and other communications
given or made pursuant hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have

prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other

11.13   _Disclosure_. The Company Disclosure Schedule is hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein. The Company may, at its option, include in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, any items that are not material in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and any such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts,
shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation that such items
are material to establish any standard of materiality or to define
further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement. In no event
shall the inclusion of any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule be
deemed or interpreted to broaden the Company's representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an
item in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission by
the Company that such item represents a material exception or fact, event, or
circumstance or that such item would be reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. The information contained in the Company Disclosure
Schedule is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever, including of any
violation of Law or breach of any agreement.

  



  

11.14   _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur,
money damages may not be a sufficient remedy and that the Parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement and immediate
injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy at Law or in equity.

MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY
AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE
CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD
DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION. Subject to _Sections 3.07(c)_ and 
_3.08(f)_ to _3.08(h)_ , the Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (and, if the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, the state courts or the Federal courts of the United
States of America located in the State of Delaware) solely in respect of
the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and hereby waive, and agree not
to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not
subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced
in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all
claims with respect to such shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware
State or Federal court.

11.16   _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party irrevocably consents to
service of process by registered mail, return receipt requested, as provided
in _Section 11.08_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

  



  

11.17   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LEGAL ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THAT
OTHERWISE RELATES TO THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

11.18   _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent hereby guarantees the due and
punctual performance and payment (not merely collection) in full of all
obligations and liabilities of Merger Sub under this Agreement, as and when
due and payable or required to be performed pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement.

  



  

11.19   _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties, an Indemnified Party, an Indemnified Director or Officer (solely with
respect to _Section 6.12_ ) or Company Counsel (solely with respect to
_Section 11.20_ )) any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  



  

11.20   _Legal Representation_.

  



  

(a)  Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), acknowledges and agrees that
each of Pepper Hamilton LLP, Grossman, Tucker, Perreault and Pfleger, PLLC and
Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP (each, " _Company Counsel_ ") has acted as
counsel for the Company in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Acquisition Engagement_ "), and in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, each
Company Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other Person, including
Parent.

  



  

(b)  Only the Company and its Affiliates shall be considered
clients of each Company Counsel in the Acquisition Engagement. Parent, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation), acknowledges and agrees that, upon and after the
Closing, all confidential communications between the Company and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and each Company Counsel, on the other hand, in
the course of the Acquisition Engagement, and any attendant attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection, and expectation of client
confidentiality applicable thereto, shall survive the Closing and be deemed
to belong solely to the Equityholders and their respective Affiliates (other
than the Company), and not the Company, and shall not pass to or be claimed,
held, or used by Parent or the Company (or, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation) or any insurance carrier providing the RandW Policy upon or after
the Closing. Accordingly, Parent shall not have access to any
such communications, or to the files of any Company Counsel relating to the
Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) to the extent
that files of any Company Counsel in respect of the Acquisition Engagement
constitute property of the client, only the Equityholders and their
respective Affiliates shall hold such property rights and (ii) each Company
Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to the Company (or, after the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation) or Parent or any insurance carrier providing the
RandW Policy by reason of any attorney-client relationship between each Company
Counsel and the Company or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, each Company Counsel shall not disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to any third parties (other than
representatives, accountants and advisors of the Equityholders and their
respective Affiliates; _provided_ that such representatives, accounts and
advisors are instructed to maintain the confidence of such attorney-client
communications). Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), irrevocably waives
any right it may have arising out of its ownership of the Company (including,
after Closing, the Surviving Corporation) or the Merger to discover or obtain
(or use, if discovered or obtained) information or documentation relating to
the Acquisition Engagement, to the extent that such information or
documentation was subject to an attorney-client privilege, work product
protection or other expectation of confidentiality owed to the Company and/or
its Affiliates. If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing,
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation) shall have the right to assert or waive any attorney-client
privilege with respect to any communication between the Company or its
Affiliates and any Person representing them that occurred at any time prior to
the Closing, Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), shall be entitled to waive
such privilege only with the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld). Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), acknowledges and
agrees that each Company Counsel has acted as counsel for the Company and its
respective Affiliates and that each Company Counsel may represent the
Equityholders, the Stockholder Representative and/or their respective
Affiliates in future matters. Accordingly, Parent, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation),
expressly consents to each Company Counsel's representation of the
Equityholders, the Stockholder Representative and/or their
respective Affiliates and/or any of their respective agents (if any of the
foregoing Persons so desire) in any matter, including, without limitation,
any post-Closing matter in which the interests of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, on the one hand, and the Equityholders, the Stockholder
Representative or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are
adverse, including any matter relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and whether or not such matter is one in which any Company
Counsel may have previously advised the Company or its Affiliates.

(c)  From and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall
cease to have any attorney-client relationship with any Company Counsel,
unless and to the extent a Company Counsel is expressly engaged in writing by
the Surviving Corporation to represent the Surviving Corporation after the
Closing. Any such representation of the Surviving Corporation by a Company
Counsel after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.
Furthermore, each Company Counsel, in its sole discretion, shall be
permitted to withdraw from representing the Surviving Corporation in order to
represent the Equityholders.

  



  

(d)  Each of the Parties to this Agreement consents to the
arrangements in this _Section 11.20_ and waives any actual or potential
conflict of interest that may be involved in connection with any
representation by any Company Counsel permitted hereunder.
