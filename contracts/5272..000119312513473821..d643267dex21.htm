Section&nbsp;1(f), the Company will not be obligated to effect more than three (3)&nbsp;such underwritten offerings in any 12-month period. In connection with any such underwritten offering, (i)&nbsp;if there are less than five total joint
book-running managing underwriters, the Company will have the right to appoint one such joint book-running managing underwriter, and (ii)&nbsp;if there are five or more total joint book-running managing underwriters, the Company will have the right
to appoint two such joint book-running managing underwriters, and in each case the Shareholder will have the right to appoint the remaining joint book-running managing underwriters; <U>provided</U>, that each of the joint book-running managing
underwriters appointed pursuant hereto will have equally shared responsibilities and economics, including for investor meetings and allocating the order book with all other joint book-running managing underwriters. In such an underwritten offering,
the Shareholder and any Investor which holds Registrable Securities which are to be sold in such offering (together with the Company) will enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such
offering. If the Shareholder disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, the Shareholder may elect to withdraw therefrom (which withdrawal will also constitute a withdrawal by all Investors) by written notice to the Company and the joint
book-running managing underwriters; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that such attempted offering will count as one of the Shareholder&#146;s three (3)&nbsp;underwritten offerings described above. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, an attempted offering will not count as one of the Shareholder&#146;s three (3)&nbsp;underwritten offerings described above if the Shareholder&#146;s decision to withdraw from, terminate, abandon or cancel such offering results from or
arises out of an action by the Company that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the timing, marketability or offering price of the securities contemplated to have been offered in such registration. </P>

no employee of the Company or any subsidiary thereof will be entitled to participate, directly or indirectly, in any such registration to the extent that the managing underwriter(s) (or, in the case of any offering that is not underwritten, a
