     | (b) | Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, from
and after the Completion Date, AerCap and the Purchaser, jointly and
severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and the

     | 7.3 | A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify the party or parties
liable for such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of any
claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, describing in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim; _provided_ that the failure to provide such notice
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under
this _clause 7_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure in connection with such claim. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

Upon receipt of notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _clause 7_ in respect of a pending or threatened claim or
demand by a third party that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or
would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under
this Agreement (such claim or demand being a "Third Party Claim"
and including a pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by a third
party against the Indemnified Party), the Indemnifying Party may, by notice to
the Indemnified Party delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the
receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, assume the defense and control
of such Third Party Claim, with its own counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and at its own expense; _provided_ that, as a condition  

---|---|--- 
 



47 agrees and acknowledges its responsibility for Losses resulting from, related
to or arising out of such Third Party Claim and shall allow the Indemnified
Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying
Party has assumed a defense of any Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying
Party will keep the Indemnified Person reasonably informed as to the status
and progress of the Third Party Claim, including the receipt of material
communications related thereto and copy the Indemnified Party on all
material pleadings, filings and other correspondence relating thereto and
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, unless such
settlement, compromise or discharge does not involve any finding or admission
of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by the Indemnified
Party and involves solely money damages payable by the Indemnifying Party, and
the Indemnifying Party shall (i) not encumber any of the material assets of
any Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would
apply to or materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party and (ii) obtain,
as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete and
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from any and all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnified
Party shall not be liable for any compromise or settlement made by the
Indemnifying Party which is not entered into in accordance with this
Agreement.  
---|--- 



     | (b) |

If the Indemnifying Party does not give notice to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim within twenty (20)
Business Days after receipt of such notice, and until the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, or if the Indemnifying Party does not diligently pursue
such defense (following written notice from the Indemnified Party of such
failure and such failure continues beyond a reasonable period), the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to proceed with its own defense of the
Third Party Claim at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Person will be bound by any determination made by the
Indemnified Person in such Third Party Claim or any compromise or settlement
effected by the Indemnified Party, including the payment of reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith;
_provided_ , however, that the Indemnified Party shall provide at least twenty
(20) Business Days advance written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any
pending compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim for which
the Indemnified Person is proceeding with its own defense (which notice shall
set forth or describe all material terms of the pending compromise or
settlement in reasonable detail) and the Indemnifying Party shall not

48 Indemnified Person without the Indemnifying Partys consent (such consent to
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). With respect to any
Third Party Claim for which the Indemnified Party is proceeding with its own
defense in accordance with this _clause 7_ , the Indemnified Party shall keep
the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed as to all material developments
related to the Third Party Claim and copy the Indemnifying Party on all
material pleadings, filings and other correspondence relating thereto. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any claim or demand for which it is seeking
indemnification from the Indemnifying Party or admit to any liability with
respect to such claim (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or demand
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _clause 7_ , no Indemnifying
Party shall have any liability under this _clause 7_ for any Losses arising
out of or in connection with any Third Party Claim that is settled or
compromised by an Indemnified Party in violation of this Agreement. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | In the event any Indemnifying Party receives notice of a
claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _clause 7_ that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify
the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days following its receipt
of such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this _clause 7_. The Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining
the validity of any such claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding,
the Parent, the Seller, AerCap and the Purchaser hereby agree that following
the Completion, the sole and exclusive remedy of a party for any breach
or inaccuracy of any Warranties is pursuant to the indemnification procedures
described in this _clause 7_. In furtherance of the foregoing, AerCap and the
Purchaser hereby waive, from and after the Completion Date, any and all other
rights, claims and causes of action AerCap or the Purchaser may have against
the Seller, the Parent or any of their Affiliates, or their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or
representatives, successors or assigns in respect of any breach of the
Warranties (other than a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _clause 7_
).

The aggregate Losses for which the Parent and the Seller shall be liable in
respect of this Agreement to AerCap, the Purchaser and any

party who shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of its
Warranties or Purchaser Warranties, as applicable, or Pre-Completion Covenants

Purchaser, its failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as a result of the

Seller by AerCap in immediately available funds. Solely for purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in any way
increasing the amount of either the Closing Failure Termination Fee, the
Alternative Acquisition Fee, Meeting Delay Termination Fee or the Adverse
Recommendation Change Termination Fee or expanding the circumstances in which
the Closing Failure Termination Fee, the Alternative Acquisition Fee, Meeting
Delay Termination Fee or the Adverse Recommendation Change Termination Fee is
to be paid, it is agreed that each of the Closing Failure Termination Fee, the
Alternative Acquisition Fee, Meeting Delay Termination Fee and the Adverse
Recommendation Change Termination Fee is liquidated damages, and not
a penalty, and the payment of the Closing Failure Termination Fee, the
Alternative Acquisition Fee, Meeting Delay Termination Fee or the Adverse
Recommendation Change Termination Fee in the circumstances specified herein is
supported by due and sufficient consideration. While Seller may pursue both a
grant of specific performance under _clause 33_ and the payment of the Closing
Failure Termination Fee, the Alternative Acquisition Fee, Meeting Delay
Termination Fee or the Adverse Recommendation Change Termination Fee under
this _clause 7_ , under no circumstances shall Seller, prior to the
Completion, be entitled to receive both (x) a grant of specific performance
which results in consummation of the Completion and (y) all or any portion of
the Closing Failure Termination Fee, the Alternative Acquisition Fee, Meeting
Delay Termination Fee or the Adverse Recommendation Change Termination Fee.
AerCap shall reimburse Seller for reasonable fees (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) incurred by Seller in enforcing its rights under
_clauses 7.8_ , _7.9_ , and _7.10_.

injunctions or other equitable relief if and to the extent permitted by
_clause 33_ , and (y) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _clause
7.5_ and receipt of payment of the Closing Failure Termination Fee pursuant to
_clause 7.8_ , shall be the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Parent, Seller and
their Affiliates against AerCap, the Purchaser, the Lenders and any of their
respective Affiliates or current or former directors, officers, employees,
shareholders, investors, partners, members, managers, representatives or
Affiliates of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Purchaser Related
Parties"), in which

provided in respect of a breach by the Parent or Seller of the warranties made
by the Parent and Seller in _paragraph 22.2(b)_ of _Part A_ of _Schedule 1_
shall be reduced by any benefits actually realized by the Purchaser
Indemnitees as a result of a failure of the information set forth in
_paragraph 22.2(b)_ of _Schedule 1_ of the Disclosure Letter to be true and
correct. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided in
respect of a breach by AerCap or the Purchaser of the warranties made by
AerCap and the Purchaser in _paragraph 20.2(b)_ of _Part B_ of _Schedule 1_
shall be reduced by any benefits actually realized by the Purchaser Group as
a result of a failure of the information set forth in _paragraph 22.2(b)_ of

_provided_ that neither the Seller nor the Parent shall be obliged to do
anything that would unreasonably interfere with any of the businesses or
operations of the Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries); and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, anything to

2 Amendments"); _provided_ that none of the Parent, Seller or Company shall
have any such obligation with respect to the Tier 2 Amendments under this
_clause 8.3(b)_ until and unless Purchaser has provided Parent and Seller
with sufficient prior notice of the final structure of the Reorganization,
including a reasonably detailed description thereof; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
reasonable best efforts of Parent, the Seller and the Company under this
_clause 8.3(b)_ to obtain the Tier 2 Amendments shall not require Parent, the
Seller or the Company to (i) pay any commitment or other similar fee or
consent fee, (ii) incur prior to the Completion any other liability, other
than out-of-pocket and other expenses (except, with respect to the Company or
its Subsidiaries, only if such incurrence does not arise until after the
Completion), (iii) take any action that would (x) unreasonably interfere with
either the Parents or Sellers ongoing business operations (except, with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries, only if such effect does not arise
until after the Completion) or (y) conflict with or violate laws, or result
in a contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a
violation or breach of, or default under, any material contract to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (iv) modify, waive, amend or
change the Revolving Credit Facility or enter into any intercreditor,
subordination or other agreement in connection therewith, (v) provide any
inducement or business to any of the lenders of the Triggered Facilities
or (vi) take any corporate action or execute any consent approving, or
executing any document or agreement relating to, the

with the foregoing, the Parent and Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cause the actions set
forth on _Schedule 8.3(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter to occur. 
---|--- 
 



     | (c) | The Parent and the Seller agree, and shall cause the
Company, to (a) cooperate and consult with the Purchaser, (b) provide the
Purchaser with all notices and other material communications with the
lenders under the Triggered Facilities related to any proposed waivers or
amendments or the transactions contemplated hereby and (c) not object to the
attendance of the Purchaser and its Representatives at any meetings or
discussions with the lenders under the Triggered Facilities related to any
proposed amendments or the transactions contemplated by this _clause 8.3_. Any
actions taken in connection with seeking any such amendments or waivers shall
be in accordance with applicable Law; accordingly, without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, the Parent and the Seller hereby agree that they
shall not, and shall not permit the Company to, take or agree or commit to
take any actions under the Triggered Facilities without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser other than those set forth in Schedule 8.3(c) of the
Disclosure Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, a failure to provide consent to
amend or waive (assuming compliance by the Parent and the Seller with
their obligations in this _clause 8.3_ ) shall not constitute a breach of
this _clause 8.3_ by the Parent or the Seller. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.4 | Subject to any applicable Laws, during the period from the
Signing Date until the Completion, except: 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | as otherwise contemplated by or necessary to effect the
matters contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and the Reorganization;

     | (b) | for matters identified in _Schedule 8.4_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Letter;

     | (c) | as may otherwise be required by applicable Law or by the
express terms of a Purchaser Benefit Plan; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | as the Parent otherwise consents in writing in advance
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being
understood and agreed that the Parent shall notify the Purchaser whether it
grants or withholds its consent as promptly as practicable and, in the case
of matters described by the Purchaser as exigent, within forty-eight (48)
hours, any such consent to be confirmed by email). 
---|---|--- 
 

AerCap shall (i) conduct its business in the ordinary course and (ii) not take
any of the actions listed in _Part B_ of  _Schedule 2_.

 



57 use their reasonable best efforts to (a) obtain any waivers or amendments
required to prevent a default or event of default under, and a breach
or acceleration of, any Indebtedness, including the Debt Financing, of any
AerCap Group Member that may arise out of or relate to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements or the Reorganization (any such
Indebtedness, the " _AerCap Triggered Facilities_ "); _provided_ that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the reasonable
best efforts of AerCap and Purchaser shall not require AerCap or Purchaser to
(i) pay any commitment or other similar fee or consent fee in excess of the
amount set forth in _Schedule 8.5_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter, (ii)
incur any other liability, (iii) take any action that would (x) unreasonably
interfere with either AerCaps or Purchasers ongoing business operations or
(y) conflict with or violate laws, or result in a contravention of, or that
would reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default
under, any material contract to which AerCap or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, (iv) modify, waive, amend or change the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Debt Financing, any Alternative Financing or any other financing to be
obtained by AerCap and/or the Purchaser in lieu of the Debt Financing, (v)

Indebtedness or (vi) take any corporate action or execute any consent
approving, or executing any document or agreement relating to, the AerCap
Triggered Facilities (except only as will be effective at the Completion), and
(b) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, finalize the
structure of the Reorganization.

8.6_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter.

     | 8.7 | AerCap and Purchaser shall ensure that the entities listed
on _Schedule 8.7_ , _Part A_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter shall
guarantee the facilities listed on _Schedule 8.7_ , _Part B_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Letter following the Completion.

     | 8.8 | Prior to January 15, 2014, AerCap and the Purchaser shall
not take any action to obtain the Tier 2 Amendments and shall not, except in
connection with the Debt Financing, any Alternative Financing and any
other financing in lieu of the Debt Financing, or as contemplated by _Clause
8.3(a)_ , have any discussions with any lenders under the Triggered Facilities
or the AerCap Triggered Facilities regarding replacing or amending such
facilities.  
---|---|--- 



     | 8.9 | AerCap and the Purchaser shall (i) use reasonable best
efforts to provide Seller and Parent with the information set forth on
Schedule 8.9 of the Disclosure Letter as soon as practicable and (ii) provide
Seller and Parent with such information no later than January 15, 2014.

     | 9.1 | AerCap shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable law and its articles of association to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held
prior to the termination of the Voting Agreement (as the duration of such
Voting Agreement may be extended) (the "AerCap Extraordinary General Meeting")
in order to obtain the AerCap Shareholder Approval. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement
shall prevent AerCap from including on the agenda for the AerCap Extraordinary
General Meeting (i) the items set forth on _Schedule 9.1_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Letter and (ii) any other matters that would not result in the
violation of _clause 8.4_ or _11.14_. AerCap shall procure that the
appointment of the Shareholder Designees (as defined in the Shareholders
Agreement) set forth on  _Schedule 9.1_ of the Disclosure Letter to the Board
is proposed and recommended for approval by AerCaps shareholders in the
agenda and proxy materials for the AerCap Extraordinary General Meeting. The
Parent and Purchaser shall provide AerCap all information about such
Shareholder Designees as shall be reasonably requested by the Board, any
committee of the Board or AerCap (including, at a minimum, any information
regarding such proposed Shareholder Designee to the extent required by
applicable Law) 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.2 | AerCap shall, through its Board of Directors, communicate
the AerCap Board Recommendation to its shareholders unless there has been an
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _clause 9.5_ and shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the AerCap
Shareholder Approval. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.3 | AerCap shall use reasonable best efforts to do, and procure
to be done, all those things necessary to ensure that the AerCap Shareholder
Approval is obtained. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 9.4 | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Parent shall cause any shares of AerCap Ordinary Shares beneficially owned
by it or any of its Subsidiaries to be voted (including by proxy) in favor
of the anticipated acquisition of the Company pursuant to article 2:107A of
the civil code of the Netherlands ( _Burgerlijk Wetboek_ ) and article 16.7 of
AerCaps articles of association at the AerCap Extraordinary General
Meeting.  
---|---|--- 



     | 9.5 | Nothing in this _clause 9_ shall be deemed to prevent AerCap
or the Board of Directors of AerCap from taking any action they are required
to take under, and in compliance with, applicable Law (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel); provided that the Board of
Directors shall not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change unless it has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that, as a result of a development or change in circumstances that occurs or
arises after the execution and delivery of this Agreement that was not known
(or if known, the consequences of which were not known) to AerCap prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (an "Intervening Event"), failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that AerCap may only take these actions described if: 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | AerCap shall have provided prior written notice to Parent
and the Seller, of its or the Board of Directors intention to take such
actions at least four (4) Business Days in advance of taking such
action, which notice shall specify, as applicable, the details of such
Intervening Event; 
---|---|--- 
 



59 actions, AerCap shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent and the Seller in good faith (to the extent Parent and
the Seller desire to negotiate) for a period of four (4) Business Days to
make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit
AerCap and the Board of Directors of AerCap not to take such actions; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | the Board of Directors of AerCap shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement or other arrangements that may be
offered in writing by Parent and the Seller by 5:00 PM EST on the
fourth (4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that it
would continue to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law not to effect the Adverse Recommendation Change if such
changes offered in writing by Parent were given effect. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.6 | AerCap shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Stock Consideration to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Completion.

   10. | Debt Financing 
---|--- 



     | 10.1 |

AerCap shall use, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Credit Agreement and any related
fee letters (the "Fee Letters"), including using reasonable best efforts (a)
to maintain in effect the Credit Agreement, (b) to satisfy (or cause its
Subsidiaries to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the
Debt Financing that are applicable to it and within its control as set forth
in the Credit Agreement and (c) to consummate the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Credit Agreement at or prior to the Completion and to timely cause the
Lenders to fund the Debt Financing. In the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Credit Agreement, AerCap shall promptly notify the Parent and the Seller of
such unavailability and, to its knowledge, the reason therefor, and AerCap
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, any such portion from alternative
sources ("Alternative Financing") on terms that will enable AerCap to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and that are not materially
less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Company or AerCap (in the reasonable
judgment of AerCap) than the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement. AerCap
shall deliver to the Parent and the Seller true and complete copies of all
agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to 

---|---|--- 
 



60 customary non-disclosure agreements and except that fee letters and engagement
letters may be redacted in a customary manner). AerCap shall not agree to (x)
any consent, amendment, supplement or other modification to the Credit
Agreement that purports to assign any Lenders obligation to fund under the
Credit Agreement on the Completion Date or (y) any other assignment of
funding obligations under the Credit Agreement, in each case, prior to the
funding of the Debt Financing on the Completion Date, in either case without
the Parents prior written consent. Except as contemplated in the
"market flex" provisions of the Fee Letters, AerCap shall not agree to or
permit, without the Parents prior written consent, any amendment, supplement
or other modification of, or any waiver of any of its rights under, the Credit
Agreement if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver (A) reduces
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, (B) adds any covenants or
conditions, compliance with which would result in a breach or default under
any Indebtedness of any Company Group Member, or (C) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (I) delay or prevent the Completion, (II) make the
funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Debt Financing) less likely to occur, (III) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing or (IV) adversely impact the ability of AerCap to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the likelihood
of AerCap doing so or (V) adversely impact the ability of AerCap to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Credit Agreement or the other
definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. AerCap shall promptly
deliver to Parent, Seller and the Company copies of any amendment, supplement
or other modification of the Credit Agreement that either (x) is otherwise
permitted under this  _clause 10.1_ or (y) has been consented to in writing
by the Parent. AerCap shall give the Parent and the Seller prompt written
notice of (x) any material breach by any party to the Credit Agreement of
which AerCap becomes aware or any termination of the Credit Agreement, or (y)
any material dispute or disagreement between or among AerCap, on the one hand,
and the Lenders on the other hand, or, to the knowledge of AerCap, among any
Lenders to the Credit Agreement or the definitive agreements related thereto
with respect to the obligation to fund any of the Debt Financing or the amount
of the Debt Financing to be funded at Completion. If at any time for any
reason AerCap believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Credit Agreement or the
definitive agreements related thereto, AerCap shall deliver prompt written
notice to the Seller. AerCap shall keep the Seller informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing and provide to the Seller copies of all related documents. In
no event shall the unavailability of any funds or financing (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by or to AerCap or any of its
Affiliates or compliance by AerCap with this _clause 10.1_ excuse AerCap or
any of its Affiliates from performance of any of its respective obligations
hereunder.

61 Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each Company
Group Member to use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause the
respective representatives of the Parent, the Seller and the Company to use
their reasonable best efforts, in each case at AerCaps expense, to provide
such customary cooperation to AerCap as may be reasonably required or
requested in connection with the Debt Financing or other financing to be
obtained by AerCap and/or the Purchaser in lieu of the Debt Financing,
including (a) cooperating with the marketing efforts for the Debt Financing,
including participating (including by way of causing management, officers and
advisors to so participate) in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence
sessions, "roadshows", drafting sessions, lender presentations and sessions
with rating agencies and prospective lenders, (b) cooperating to facilitate
the pledging of, granting of security interests in and obtaining perfection of
any Liens on, collateral in connection with the Debt Financing (including any
field exams, appraisals and environmental due diligence reasonably requested
by AerCap) and using reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents,
approvals and authorizations which shall be reasonably requested by AerCap to
permit pledging of collateral, to the extent required in connection with
the Debt Financing, (c) facilitating the receipt of documentation that will
evidence the repayment of existing Indebtedness, if any, of each Company Group
Member required to be repaid in connection with the Debt Financing and
releases of any Liens securing existing Indebtedness of each Company Group
Member, in each case upon the repayment of such Indebtedness substantially
concurrently with the initial funding of the Debt Financing, (d) assisting
with negotiating, entering into, executing and delivering amendments or
waivers to existing Indebtedness of each Company Group Member to the extent
that AerCap determines to be necessary or desirable and any intercreditor
agreements, guarantee agreements, pledge and security documents, indentures,
other definitive financing documents or other requested certificates or
documents, including corporate and similar resolutions, closing, officer and
secretary certificates, (e) assisting in obtaining such customary
legal opinions as reasonably requested by AerCap (provided that none of the
Parent, the Seller, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective legal
counsel shall be obligated to render any such legal opinions) and customary
comfort letters (including customary negative assurance) and consents from
the independent accountants of the Company for the use of their reports and
materials in any offering memorandum as reasonably requested by AerCap in
connection with the Debt Financing, including, in each case by executing and
delivering customary representation letters to the independent accountants of
the Company related thereto, (f) providing any information as may be required
under "know your customer" and anti-money-laundering rules and regulations,
(g) permitting any cash and marketable securities of each Company Group Member
to be made available to AerCap at the Completion that would not adversely
affect Parents or Sellers ability to fulfill their obligations under
_clause 8.3_, (h) assisting in obtaining an updated public corporate
credit/family rating from Moodys Investor Services, a public corporate credit
rating from Standard and Poors Ratings Services LLC, a division of The McGraw
Hill Corporation, and Fitch Ratings,

with respect to information provided by the Company Group Members and a
representation that any public-side version of such information does not
include material nonpublic information; and (j) providing, and causing
the accountants for the Company Group to provide, such reasonable cooperation
as may be requested by AerCap to facilitate the preparation of pro forma
financial statements by AerCap (provided that AerCap shall provide to the
Company reasonably in advance (a) any post-Completion or pro forma cost
savings, capitalization and other post-Completion or pro forma adjustments
(and the assumptions relating thereto) desired by AerCap to be reflected in
such pro forma and summary financial data and (b) any other information that
may be reasonably and timely requested by the Company concerning the
assumptions underlying the post-Completion or pro forma adjustments to be made
in such pro forma and summary financial data, which assumptions shall be the
responsibility of AerCap); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Parent, the Seller or
the Company shall (i) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee

transaction that would prevent, materially delay or materially impede the

initial public offering of the Company, notwithstanding the fact that any such
failure to file or other inaction may result in the Company Prospectus being
deemed stale by the SEC. On the Completion Date, the Seller shall cause ILFC
Holdings, Inc. to file a Registration Withdrawal Request on Form RW with the
SEC with respect to the Company Prospectus. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Seller and the Parent may take any action reasonably necessary or advisable in

take any actions to accelerate the vesting thereof, and shall not otherwise
cause or allow an acceleration of the vesting or an accelerated payment or

     | 13.3 | For a period ending on the later of the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (including extensions) and six years from
the Completion Date, following Completion, the Parent shall retain and shall
procure that its Affiliates shall retain, and shall allow the Purchaser, and
its Affiliates and their respective Representatives access to, in each case in
accordance with the provisions of _clause 12.2_ , any Books and Records
proprietary to the Company Group which (i) are relevant to calculating or to
the reporting of any Tax, and (ii) relate (but not exclusively or
predominantly) to the business carried on by the Company Group as at or prior
to Completion, _provided_ that, if the Purchaser has notified the Parent in
writing no later than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of such period
that such Books and Records should not be disposed of, the Parent shall (at
the Parents sole option) either (a) continue to preserve such Books and
Records until notified by the Purchaser that the Purchaser no longer objects
to their disposal or (b) provide the Purchaser the opportunity to remove and
retain such Books and Records at the Purchasers expense and if the Purchaser
does not take such opportunity within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of
notice from the Parent, the Parent or its Affiliates, as the case may be,
shall be entitled to dispose of such Books and Records.

   14. | Transitional Services 
---|--- 



     | 14.1 | Where a Related Party Contract gives any member of the
Retained Group the right to terminate or vary in any way that agreement as a
result of the entering into or performance of any of the Transaction
Agreements, the Parent and the Seller shall procure that such member does not
exercise such right except as set forth in _Schedule 14.1_ of the Disclosure
Letter. 
---|---|--- 
 



77 procure that each member of the Retained Group provides, the Purchaser, its
Affiliates and their professional advisers with such access to their premises,
systems, personnel and records (including information and data relating to
the performance and costing of services, and the achievement of service
levels) as the Purchaser may reasonably require in order to understand and
assess the terms of any Related Party Contract. 
---|---|--- 



     | 14.3 | At the Purchasers request, the Seller and the Purchaser
shall act in good faith to negotiate and agree (with effect from the
Completion Date) such amendments to any Related Party Contract (other than the
servicing agreements for Castle 2003-1 Trust and Castle 2003-2 Trust and any
other Transaction Agreement) as may be reasonably required by the Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | 14.4 | For the avoidance of doubt, the servicing agreements for
Castle 2003-1 Trust and Castle 2003-2 Trust shall not terminate as a
consequence of the Completion. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 14.5 | The parties shall act in good faith to negotiate and agree
(with effect from the Completion Date) to Schedule B to the Shareholders
Agreement, which Schedule B shall be based on the schedule of transition
services reviewed by the parties prior to the Signing Date. 
---|---|--- 



   15. | Non-solicitation 
---|--- 



     | 15.1 | The Parent will not, and undertakes to procure that each of
its Affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, pending or within three (3)
years after the Completion Date, solicit or entice away from the
employment of any member of the Company Group any Senior Employee of any
member of the Company Group, _provided_ that this _clause 15.1_ shall not
operate so as to prevent (i) the recruitment of staff by placing a general
bona fide recruitment advertisement which may come to the attention of (but
is not specifically directed at or brought to the attention of) any such
Senior Employee or (ii) any solicitation of a Senior Employee who is no longer
employed by any Company Group Member.  
---|---|--- 



     | 15.2 | In consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions
contained in this Agreement, each of the Parent and the Purchaser hereby
acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Purchaser has required the Parent to make
the covenants set forth in this _clause 15_ as a condition to each of the
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement, (b) the Parents covenants in
this _clause 15_ are reasonable with respect to their duration and scope
and necessary to protect and preserve the goodwill and business of the
Company Group to be acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, and
(c) the business, the value of the operating assets and goodwill of the
Company Group acquired by the Purchaser would be irreparably damaged if the
Parent were to breach the covenants set forth in this _clause 15_. 
---|---|--- 
 



78 hereby agrees and acknowledges that, if the Parent or the Seller breaches or
threatens to breach any of the covenants contained in this _clause 15_ , the
damage or imminent damage to the business, the value of the operating assets
and goodwill of the Company Group would be irreparable and extremely difficult
to estimate, making any remedy at law or in damages inadequate. Accordingly,
in addition to any damages or other remedy available under applicable law,
the Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction against the Parent for any breach or threatened breach of the
covenants set forth in this  _clause 15_. 
---|---|--- 



   16. | Tax Matters

written consent or as otherwise provided in this Agreement) none of AerCap or
any Affiliate of AerCap will make any election under Section 338 of the U.S.
Tax Code or any U.S. state jurisdiction with respect to any Company Group
Member, except for elections under Section 338 as provided herein.

which a Section 338(h)(10) election is made pursuant to _clause 16.1_ , among
the assets of the affected Company Group Member (each a "Section 338

The Seller and AerCap shall each bear 50% of the costs and expenses
associated with the Independent Accountant. The determinations of the
Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive. The dispute
resolution under this _clause 16.2_ shall constitute arbitration under
the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitration shall have its seat in New York,

take any position contrary thereto (unless and to the extent required to do so
pursuant to a determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the U.S. Tax
Code or any similar U.S. state or local Tax provision)) nor modify or revoke
any Section 338(h)(10) election. The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate
to file Tax Returns necessary to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) elections.

U.S. federal and state Income Taxes of International Lease Finance
Corporation, Ltd (Bermuda) for any Pre-Completion Tax Period and the portion

employment contracts, other agreements relating to the acquisition of goods
or services or loan agreements for borrowed money) or of any agreement
relating to the purchase or sale of assets, in each case, together with any
reasonable out-of-pocket professional fees related thereto; provided that, in
the case of _clauses (ii)  (iv)_, if such Taxes were included in Current

for such Taxes until the aggregate amount of such Taxes exceeds the amount
described in _clause (a)_ of the definition of Aggregate Current Tax

Group, in each case, in a manner consistent with past practice and applicable
Law. The Company shall prepare all other Tax Returns of any Company Group

Return for a Pre-Completion Tax Period or a Straddle Period, shall prepare
such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with applicable Law and deliver at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including permissible
extensions) to the Seller a copy of such Tax Returns for the Sellers review
and comment. The Company and the Seller agree to consult and resolve in good
faith any issue arising as a result of any such Tax Return. In the event the
Company and the Seller are unable to resolve any dispute within ten (10)
calendar days following the delivery of the copy of such Tax Return to the
Seller, the Company and the Seller shall jointly request that the Independent
Accountant make a determination in resolution of any issue in dispute as
promptly as possible. The Company and the Seller shall each bear 50% of the
costs and expenses associated with the Independent Accountant. AerCap and the
Company shall not amend or cause to be amended any Tax Return of a Company
Group Member for a Pre-Completion Tax Period or a Straddle Period without the
consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.5 | The Parent, the Seller, each Company Group Member, AerCap
and each Purchaser Group Member will reasonably cooperate, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to reasonably cooperate, in connection with
the preparation, filing and execution of Tax Returns and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation will
include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder or to testify at any such proceeding. In
connection with the foregoing, AerCap shall cause the relevant Purchaser Group
Members to prepare and provide to the Parent a package of tax information
materials (including schedules and work papers, as listed on _Schedule 16.5_
 of the Disclosure Letter) (the "Tax Package") required by the Parent to
enable the Parent to prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be prepared
and filed by it for its 2013 and 2014 Tax years and any prior Tax years. The
Tax Package shall be completed in a manner consistent with past practice,
including past practice as to providing such information and as to the method
of computation of separate taxable income or other relevant measure of income
of each member. AerCap shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (i) the Tax
Package with respect to the 2013 Tax year to be delivered to the Parent no
later than June 1, 2014, to the extent such information has not been provided
prior to the Completion, and (ii) with respect to the Parents 2014 Tax year,
(A) a reasonably accurate draft of Section 338 Allocation Schedule including
state apportionment to be delivered to the Parent no later than sixty (60)
days after the Completion Date, and (B) the Tax Package to be delivered
within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Completion Date. The
obligations in this _clause 16.5_ are subject to the same restrictions as set
out in _clauses 12.1_  or _12.2_ , as applicable. 
---|---|--- 
 



81 which if successful might result in an indemnity payment to an indemnified
party pursuant to _clause 16.3_ or _7.2_ , then such indemnified party
shall give notice to the indemnifying party in writing of such claim (a "Tax
Claim"); _provided_ , _however_ , the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the indemnifying party has been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. The Seller shall have sole control over all proceedings and may make
all decisions taken in connection with any Tax Claims for Taxes related to any
consolidated, combined, affiliated, controlled or unitary group that includes
a member of the Retained Group and any Company Group Member and any Tax Claims
for U.S. federal and state Income Taxes of International Lease Finance
Corporation, Ltd (Bermuda) for which Seller is responsible under _clause
16.3_. With respect to any Tax Claim that is not covered by the second
sentence of this _clause 16.6_ , the Purchaser shall, solely at its own cost
and expense, control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in
connection with such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , if such Tax Claim
might result in an indemnity payment by the Parent or the Seller pursuant to
_clause 7.2_ , the Purchaser shall keep the Parent reasonably informed
and shall not settle such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the Parent and counsel
of its own choosing shall have the right to participate fully, at its own
expense, in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim.
AerCap and Purchaser shall notify the Parent in writing of any Tax Claim made
by a Governmental Authority or any payment or action that might result in an
indemnity payment to the Parent pursuant to  _clause 7.2_ and shall keep the
Parent reasonably informed of the status of any such Tax Claim. AerCap and the
Purchaser shall provide or make available to the Parent or the Seller any
information or documentation reasonably requested by the Parent or Seller in
its determination of the amount of Taxes subject to indemnification under
_clause 7.2_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
provisions of _clause 7.3_ shall not control with respect to a Tax Claim.

sharing agreements between a Company Group Member and a member of the Retained

force or effect as to any Company Group Member on and after the Completion
Date and that there shall be no further liabilities or obligations imposed on
any Company Group Member under any such agreements.

be entitled to receive and retain any other refund or other reimbursement or
credit (including from any overpayment) actually received or applied to
offset any other Tax liability of a Company Group Member. The Company and the
Seller, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the other party of the
receipt of any refund or other reimbursement or credit to which the other
party is entitled hereunder and pay over such refund or other reimbursement or
the amount of such credit, net of any cost attributable to such receipt or
recognition. AerCap and the Seller shall reasonably cooperate to amend or
cause to be amended any Tax Returns to obtain any refunds to which the other
party is entitled hereunder.

     | 16.10  | The Parent will use reasonable best efforts to determine
and disclose to AerCap if the Parent owns any AerCap Ordinary Shares (other
than the Stock Consideration) directly or indirectly through the ownership
attribution rules under Section 318(a) (other than _paragraph (4)_ thereof)
of the U.S. Tax Code, except AerCap Ordinary Shares owned by the Parent
through an entity in which the Parent or its Affiliate owns less than 5% of
the economic interest. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the covenant under this _clause 16.10_ shall terminate and be extinguished as
of the Completion Date, and the Parent shall have no liability with respect to
such covenant after the Completion Date.

     | 17.1 | The terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated July 3,
2013, between the Parent and AerCap and any amendments thereto (collectively,
the "Confidentiality Agreement") are incorporated into this Agreement by
reference and shall continue in full force and effect until Completion, at

83 Subsidiaries), and following Completion, the Parent and the Seller shall
maintain in confidence any written, oral or other information relating or
obtained from the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries except that the

the public other than (i) in the case of AerCap or the Purchaser, as a result
of a disclosure by the Parent or its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives and (ii) in the case of the Parent or the Seller,

in connection with any Action or in any dispute with respect to the
Transaction Agreements (including in response to any summons, subpoena or
other legal process or formal or informal investigative demand issued to the
disclosing party in the course of any litigation, investigation or
administrative proceeding); 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | any such information was or becomes available to such party

Agreement or any Affiliate or Representative of such party) that is not bound
by a confidentiality agreement with respect to such information; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | any such information that becomes known or available
pursuant to or as a result of the carrying out of the provisions of a
Transaction Agreement (which information shall be governed by the
confidentiality provisions, if any, set out therein). 
---|---|--- 

Each of the parties hereto shall instruct its Affiliates and Representatives
having access to such information of such obligation of confidentiality.



     | 17.3 | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that

obtained from AerCap or the Purchaser or their Affiliates (including the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) with the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York and its respective Representatives.

---|--- 



     | 31.1 | This Agreement, all transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and all claims and defenses of any nature (including contractual
and non-contractual claims and defenses) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and the formation,
applicability, breach, termination or validity of this Agreement, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would apply the
Law of another jurisdiction. 
---|---|--- 
 



92 connection with, or relating to, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the formation, applicability, breach,
termination or validity thereof, shall be finally settled exclusively by
arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International
Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") in effect at the time of the arbitration,
except as they may be modified herein or by mutual agreement of the parties.
The arbitration shall be conducted by three arbitrators (the "Arbitral
Tribunal"). The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language and the
seat of the arbitration shall be New York, New York. 
---|---|--- 



     | 31.3 | The party or parties initiating arbitration (the
"Claimant(s)") shall nominate an arbitrator in its (their) request for
arbitration (the "Arbitration Request"). The party or parties named as
Respondent(s) in the Arbitration Request (the "Respondent(s)") shall nominate
an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Arbitration Request
and shall notify the Claimant(s) of such nomination in writing. If within
thirty (30) days of receipt of the Arbitration Request by the Respondent(s),
the Respondent(s) has (have) not nominated an arbitrator, then the
International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce
(the "ICC Court") shall appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the Respondent(s).
The first two arbitrators nominated by the parties or appointed by the ICC
Court in accordance with the above shall nominate a third arbitrator within
thirty (30) days of the confirmation by the ICC Court (or appointment in
accordance with the above) of the arbitrator nominated/appointed on behalf of
the Respondent(s). When the third arbitrator has accepted the nomination, the
other two arbitrators shall promptly notify the parties of the nomination. If
the first two arbitrators nominated/appointed fail to nominate a third
arbitrator within the thirty (30) days referred to above, the ICC Court shall
appoint the third arbitrator and shall promptly notify the parties of the
appointment. The third arbitrator shall act as chair of the Arbitral Tribunal.
Each arbitrator shall be qualified to practice law under the Laws of the State
of New York. An arbitrator shall be deemed to have met these qualifications
unless any party objects within fifteen (15) days. 
---|---|--- 



     | 31.4 | The parties agree that any Award by the Arbitral Tribunal
on interim measures shall be fully enforceable as such and an application for
interim measures to a court of competent jurisdiction by any party to
the arbitration shall not be deemed incompatible with, or a waiver of, the
agreement to arbitrate set out in this _clause 31_. 
---|---|--- 



     | 31.5 |

In order to facilitate the comprehensive resolution of related disputes and to
avoid inconsistent decisions in related disputes, upon request of any party
to an arbitration proceeding commenced pursuant to this _clause 31_ , any
dispute, controversy or claim subsequently noticed for arbitration under the
provisions of this _clause 31_ may be consolidated with the earlier-
commenced arbitration proceeding, as determined within the discretion of the
Arbitral Tribunal appointed 

---|---|--- 
 



93 Tribunal must not consolidate such arbitrations unless the Arbitral Tribunal
determines that (i) there are issues of fact or law common to the
proceedings, so that a consolidated proceeding would be more efficient than
separate proceedings, and (ii) no party hereto would be prejudiced as a result
of such consolidation through undue delay, conflict of interest or otherwise.
If the Arbitral Tribunal and any arbitration tribunal appointed in a
subsequent arbitration proceeding disagree as to whether their respective
arbitrations should be consolidated there shall be no consolidation. 
---|--- 
 



     | 31.6 | Subject to _clause 17.3_ , the parties, the ICC Court, any
arbitrator, and their agents or representatives, shall keep confidential and
not disclose to any non-party the existence of the arbitration, non-
public materials and information provided in the arbitration by another
party, and orders or awards made in the arbitration (together, the
"Confidential Information"). If a party or an arbitrator wishes to involve in
the arbitration a non-party, including a fact or expert witness,
stenographer, translator or any other person, the party or arbitrator shall
make reasonable efforts to secure the non-partys advance agreement to
preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent
necessary to: (i) prosecute or defend the arbitration or proceedings related
to it (including enforcement or annulment proceedings), or to pursue a legal
right; (ii) respond to a compulsory order or request for information of a
governmental or regulatory body; (iii) make disclosure required by law or by
the rules of a securities exchange; (iv) seek legal, accounting or other
professional services, or satisfy information requests of potential acquirers,
investors or lenders, _provided_ that in each case of any disclosure allowed
under the foregoing circumstances (i) through (iv), where possible,
the producing party takes reasonable measures to ensure that the recipient
preserves the confidentiality of the information provided. The Arbitral
Tribunal may permit further disclosure of Confidential Information where there
is a demonstrated need to disclose that outweighs any partys legitimate
interest in preserving confidentiality. This confidentiality provision
survives termination of this Agreement and of any arbitration brought pursuant
to this Agreement. This confidentiality provision may be enforced by an
arbitral tribunal or any court of competent jurisdiction, and an application
to a court to enforce this provision shall not waive or in any way derogate
from the agreement to arbitrate set out in this _clause 31_. 
---|---|--- 



     | 31.7 | Solely in respect of any dispute, controversy or claim
arising out of or in connection with the refusal by either party to effect the
Completion including taking actions required hereunder before the Completion,
and notwithstanding any other provision of this _clause 31_ , the following
provisions shall apply: 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) |

the arbitration shall be conducted in an expedited manner. There shall be one
round of pre-hearing submissions by each party, whether simultaneous
or sequential as directed by the Arbitral Tribunal, and no reply or rejoinder
submissions shall be made unless the Arbitral Tribunal 

---|---|--- 
 



94 held within four months of the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and shall
continue, to the extent practicable, from Business Day to Business Day until
completed. There shall be no post-hearing submissions except as directed by
the Arbitral Tribunal, and before ordering such submissions, the Arbitral
Tribunal shall identify for the parties, on the basis of its assessment of
the case as of that time, the specific issues or matters it believes should
be addressed. The Arbitral Tribunal shall endeavor to render its Award within
six weeks of the last day of the arbitration hearing. The Arbitral Tribunal
may modify the provisions of this _clause 31.7_ for good cause shown. Failure
to comply with any time period set out in this _clause 31.7_ shall not affect
in any way the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal or the validity of its
Award;  
---|--- 



     | (b) | any request for production of documents or other information
shall be subject to the express authorization of the Arbitral Tribunal, which
shall endeavor to ensure that any such requests are as limited and
disciplined as is consistent with the just resolution of the dispute,
controversy or claim. The parties expressly waive any right to seek evidence
under Section 1782 of title 28 of the U.S. Code or any other provision
contained in the arbitration or other procedural rules or Laws of any
jurisdiction. A party may request, and the Arbitral Tribunal should authorize,
production only of specific documents or narrow and specific categories of
documents that are critical to the fair presentation of a partys case and
reasonably believed to exist and be in the possession, custody or control of
the other party; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the Arbitral Tribunal shall have power to make any Award
that it deems just and appropriate, including specific performance or
injunctive relief. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 31.8 | If there is any dispute as to whether a dispute,
controversy or claim is subject to arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal shall
have jurisdiction to decide the same. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 31.9 | The agreement to arbitrate under this _clause 31_ shall be
specifically enforceable. Any Award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal shall be
in writing and shall be final and binding upon the parties, and may
include an award of costs, including reasonable legal fees and disbursements,
to the prevailing party. The parties undertake to carry out any Award without
delay and waive their right to any form of recourse based on grounds other
than those contained in the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958 insofar as such waiver can
validly be made. Judgment upon any Award may be entered by any court having
jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its
assets and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, the parties agree that any
court of competent jurisdiction in which enforcement of the Award is sought
shall have power to enforce the relief awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal,
regardless of whether such relief is characterized as legal, equitable or
otherwise. 
---|---|--- 
 



95 of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring, or permit any of its
Affiliates to bring, any suit, action or other proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Lenders or any Affiliate thereof arising out of or
relating to (x) the Credit Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by
the Credit Agreement or the performance of services thereunder or (y) this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any forum other
than any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in New York County, and any appellate court from any thereof, and
each of the parties hereto agrees that the waiver of jury trial set forth in
_clause 31.11_ shall be applicable to any such suit, action or other
proceeding. The Lenders and their Affiliates are express third party
beneficiaries of this _clause 31.10_. 
---|---|--- 



     | 31.11 | Each party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, New York for
enforcing the parties agreement to arbitrate, enforcing any arbitration Award
or obtaining or enforcing interim measures (including injunctive relief). THE
PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY IN ANY COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN ANY MATTERS ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION
INVOLVING THE LENDERS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. The Lenders and their Affiliates are express third-party
beneficiaries of this _clause 31.11_. 
---|---|--- 



   32. | Agent for Service of Process 
---|--- 



     | 32.1 | Without prejudice to any other permitted mode of service,
each of the Parent and the Seller irrevocably agrees that service of any claim
form, notice or other document for the purpose of _clause 31_ shall be duly
served upon it if delivered personally or sent by pre-paid recorded delivery,
special delivery or registered post to AerCap Inc., presently located in the
United States at 100 NE Third Avenue, Suite 800, Fort Lauderdale, Florida
33301, or such other Person and address in New York, New York as the Parent

the parties agree that failure by such appointed Person to notify their
appointor of any such service shall not invalidate the proceedings concerned. 
---|---|--- 



     | 32.2 | Without prejudice to any other permitted mode of service,
each of AerCap and the Purchaser irrevocably agrees that service of any claim
form, notice or other document for the purpose of _clause 31_ shall be duly
served upon it if delivered personally or sent by pre-paid recorded delivery,
special delivery or registered post to the address of Parent provided in
_clause 20_ or such other Person and address in New York, New York as

their appointor of any such service shall not invalidate the proceedings
concerned. 
---|---|--- 
 



96 ---|--- 



     | 33.1 | Without prejudice to any non-monetary rights or remedies
available to it, AerCap and the Purchaser hereby irrevocably waive any right
which it may have to claim damages (or other monetary rights or remedies) from
the Seller for breach of any of the obligations, commitments, undertakings or
warranties given by the Parent or the Seller under this Agreement. In
consideration of AerCap and the Purchaser agreeing to such waiver and without
prejudice to the other terms of this Agreement, the Parent agrees to be
solely and exclusively responsible to AerCap and the Purchaser for any damages

such waiver, have been liable to AerCap, the Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates under this Agreement.

otherwise (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. The
parties hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the parties in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the
parties. 
---|---|--- 



     | 33.3 | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
it is acknowledged and agreed that the Parent and the Seller shall be entitled
to seek specific performance of AerCaps and the Purchasers obligation to
consummate the Transaction only in the event that all of the Conditions with

with respect to those Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Completion, are capable of being satisfied at the Completion, the Debt
Financing or Alternative Financing has been funded or will be funded at

would arise out of the Reorganization shall have been obtained. 
---|---|--- 



     | 33.4 | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Parent and the Seller agree on their behalf and on behalf of their
Affiliates that none of the Lenders shall have any liability or obligation to
the Parent and the Seller and their respective Affiliates relating to this
Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or any of the transactions

provisions of this Agreement, in each case when expressly available pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction.  
---|---|--- 



     | 33.6 | To the extent any party hereto brings any action prior to
the Completion to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement when available to such party pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Long-Stop Date shall automatically be extended
by ( _i_ ) the amount of time during which such action is pending, plus five
(5) Business Days, or ( _ii_ ) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action. 
---|---|--- 



   34. | Adjustment of Purchase Price 
---|---

AerCap has delivered to the Parent and the Seller a copy of the duly executed
credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") and the related Fee Letters (except
that the amounts of fees, pricing caps and other economic terms (none of which

the amount of the Debt Financing below the amount necessary to satisfy the
Purchasers obligation to pay (i) the aggregate Cash Consideration and (ii)
any fees and expenses of or payable by the Purchaser or AerCap in connection
with the Completion and the Debt Financing) set forth therein may be
redacted), among AerCap and the financial institutions identified therein (the
"Lenders"), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to provide debt financing in
the amounts set forth therein (the "Debt Financing"). As of the Signing Date,
the Credit Agreement is in full force and effect and constitutes a valid,
binding and enforceable (subject to the Bankruptcy Exceptions) obligation of
AerCap and, to the knowledge of AerCap, the other parties thereto. As of the
Signing Date, the Credit Agreement has not been amended or modified since a
copy thereof was delivered to the Parent and the Seller, and the respective
commitments contained in the Credit Agreement have not been withdrawn,
decreased or rescinded in any respect. There are no side letters or other
agreements, arrangements, contracts or understandings that could adversely
affect the availability of the Debt Financing. AerCap has fully paid any and
all fees in connection with the Credit Agreement due and payable on or prior
to the date hereof and will pay in full any such amount due on or before the
Completion Date. Except as expressly set forth in the Credit Agreement or the
related Fee Letters, there are no conditions to the obligations of the parties
thereunder to make the Debt Financing available to AerCap on the
terms therein or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce
the total amount of the Debt Financing. As of the Signing Date (i) no event
has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent
on the part of AerCap or, to the knowledge of AerCap, any of the other parties
to the Credit Agreement under the Credit Agreement and (ii) AerCap has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Credit Agreement will not be satisfied or that the Debt
Financing will not be made available to AerCap at the Completion; _provided_
that in making such representations, AerCap is relying on the truth and
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Parent and the Seller
contained in _Part A_ of _Schedule 1_ (without giving effect to any
materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications or any knowledge
qualifications) and compliance by the Parent and the Seller with their
obligations under _clause 10.2_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in _clause 3_ , the Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with
the Credit Agreement, will provide AerCap with cash proceeds (after netting
out original issue discount and similar premiums and charges after giving
effect to the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount flex)
provided under the relevant fee letters) on the Completion Date sufficient
for the satisfaction of the Purchasers obligation to (i) pay the aggregate
Cash Consideration and (ii) pay any fees and expenses of or payable by the
Purchaser or AerCap in connection with the Completion and the Debt Financing.

AerCap and the Purchaser further acknowledge and agree that (i) the only
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Parent, the
Seller, any of their Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person are the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made in this Agreement
and (ii) except for the Warranties, none of the Parent, the Seller and their
Affiliates or Representatives makes any representation or warranty of any kind

promptly as practicable, the Parent and each Investor shall use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to implement the

ARTICLE V

 

TAX MATTERS

5.1 _Tax Return Information_. The Company will as promptly as practicable
furnish to any Investor information reasonably requested to enable such
Investor or its direct or indirect equity owners to comply with any applicable
tax reporting requirements with respect to Company Ordinary Shares held by
such Investor, including, without limitation, such information as may be
reasonably requested by such Investor to complete U.S. federal, state or local
or non-U.S. income tax returns. The Company will use reasonable best efforts
to provide any tax-related information that is required to be provided to the
Investors by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of a fiscal
year within sixty (60) calendar days following the end of such fiscal year.

5.2 _PFIC and CFC Information_. After the end of each fiscal year, the Company
will timely determine whether the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
expected to be, or was, a PFIC or CFC for any taxable year and inform the
Investors of its determination. If the Company believes the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a PFIC or a CFC for any taxable year or there is a
reasonable possibility that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be a
PFIC or a CFC for any taxable year, the Company will prepare an annual
statement that sets forth an estimate of the amount that the Investors would
be required to include in taxable income on their U.S. tax returns if the
Company or such Subsidiary did in fact constitute a PFIC or a CFC for such
taxable year, as well as any other information required to comply with
applicable CFC and PFIC reporting requirements. Each of the Investors will
cooperate with the Company, and provide such information as may be reasonably
requested by the Company, to determine whether the Company is a CFC.

 

5.3 _QEF Election_. If the Company believes there is a reasonable possibility
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries constitutes a PFIC for any
taxable year, the Company will provide the Investors with the information
necessary in order for the Investors or any direct or indirect equity owner
therein, as the case may be, to timely and properly make an election
under section 1295 of the Code to treat the Company or such Subsidiary as a
"qualified electing fund" (a "QEF Election") and comply with the reporting
requirements applicable to such a QEF Election. The Company will
obtain professional assistance experienced in matters relating to the
relevant aspects of the Code to the extent necessary to make the
determinations and to provide the information and statements described in
Section 5.1 and this Section 5.3. 

5.4 _Retention of Tax Information_. The Company hereby undertakes to keep any
documentation supporting any tax-related information supplied to any Investor
as provided under this Article V for no less than seven (7) years.

 



-23- 5.5 _Cooperation_. The Company will reasonably cooperate with the Investors in
considering structures that mitigate any adverse PFIC or CFC tax consequences
to the Investors and that limit withholding or capital gain taxes with respect
to amounts paid to the Investors, including in connection with any transfer of
Company Ordinary Shares. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Company
will, at the Shareholders request, consult with the Shareholder regarding the
advisability of making an election to treat any Subsidiary for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as an association taxable as a corporation, a partnership
or a disregarded entity under U.S. Treasury Regulations section 301.7701-3(a);
_provided_ that the Company shall have the sole discretion to make any final
decision regarding such elections.

authority to represent the Company in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent,
lawyer, employee, representative, joint venturer or fiduciary of the Company.

party that the Parent has any power or authority to negotiate or conclude any

Reuters Telerate Screen as at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each day during the
period for which interest is to be paid.

 

6.7 _Service Taxes_. Any sales tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax or
similar tax (" _Service Taxes_ ") (but excluding any Service Tax based upon
the net income of the Shareholder, which shall be for the account of the
Shareholder) shall be separately stated on the relevant invoice and shall be
paid by the Company to the Shareholder in accordance with Exhibit B;

any such Service Taxes. The Shareholder shall be responsible for remitting any
such Service Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority.

notice of termination under this Section 6.8, the " _Terminating Party_ ")
may terminate this Article VI on thirty (30) days prior written notice to the
other (the " _Other Party_ ") if the Other Party is in default of any of its
material obligations under this Article VI; _provided_ , that the Terminating
Party shall not be entitled to terminate this Article VI if the Other Party
shall have remedied such default to the Terminating Partys reasonable
satisfaction within such thirty (30) day period. Any termination notice
delivered pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall specify in reasonable detail the
particulars of the breach. Other than Services relating to human resources,
the Company may, for any reason or no reason, discontinue receiving any or
all of the Services by giving the Parent at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice, which notice shall specify the date as of which any such
Services shall be discontinued. Exhibit B shall be deemed amended to delete
such discontinued Services as of the termination date specified in such
notice, and this Article VI shall be of no further force and effect for such
discontinued Services, except as to obligations accrued prior to the date
of discontinuation of such Services.

the Company and its Affiliates and their respective directors and officers
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, against all claims,
liabilities, damages, losses or expenses to the extent arising out of the
gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct by the Parent or its
Representatives in the performance of the Services. The Company shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent and its Affiliates and their
respective directors and officers and their respective successors and
permitted assigns against all claims, liabilities, damages, losses or expenses
to the extent arising out of the gross negligence, recklessness or willful
misconduct by the Company, its Affiliates, employees, agents, subcontractors
or assigns for bodily injury to persons or physical damage to tangible
personal or real property for which the Company is legally liable to that
third party, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence, recklessness
or willful misconduct of the Parent, its Affiliates, employees, agents,
subcontractors or assigns in the performance of the Services. Neither the
Parent nor the Company shall be liable in respect of any indemnification
obligation under this Section 6.9 in excess of the fees paid under this
Article VI. Neither the Parent nor the Company shall be liable to the other
for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary or punitive
damages (including lost or anticipated revenues or profits, failure
to realize expected savings, expenses of investigation, enforcement and
collection and attorneys and accountants fees and expenses) arising from the
provision of Services hereunder, whether such claim is based on warranty,

the same. Any claim hereunder shall be made subject to and in accordance with
the indemnification procedures in the Share Purchase Agreement.

transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and the formation, applicability,
breach, termination or validity of this Agreement, shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands without giving
effect to any conflicts of law principles that would apply the Law of another
jurisdiction.

 

(b) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with, or
relating to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the formation, applicability, breach, termination or validity
thereof, shall in the first instance be settled by the courts of Amsterdam,
The Netherlands.

 

7.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have an adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor
and that the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of this
Agreement and without that right, none of the Parent, the Shareholder, the
Investors or the Company would have entered into this Agreement. It is
accordingly agreed by the parties hereby that, prior to any termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of
damages or otherwise (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or
in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement by the Parent, the Shareholder, the Investors or the Company is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the Parent, the Shareholder, the Investors or the Company otherwise
have an adequate remedy at law. The parties further acknowledge and agree that
it is their anticipation and expectation that specific enforcement will be
the primary remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached.

 

7.15 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and their permitted successors and assigns and
is not intended to and shall not confer upon any other Person any rights (
_geen derdenbeding_ ), benefits or remedies of any nature under or by reason
of this Agreement. Accordingly, any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement may not enforce any of its terms.

7.16 _Obligation to Update Schedule A_. The Parent, the Shareholder and
each Investor shall, as promptly as practicable following the completion of
any acquisition or Transfer of any security of the Company or any Derivative
Instrument, notify the Company in writing of such acquisition or Transfer and
provide the Company with any information or materials with respect to

 



-30-  such acquisition or Transfer (including the amount acquired or Transferred
and the identity of the counterparty to such acquisition or Transfer)
reasonably requested by the Company. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
in connection with any acquisitions or Transfers of securities of the Company
in accordance with the terms hereof, the parties hereto will, as promptly as
practicable following the completion of such acquisition or Transfer, modify
Schedule A to reflect the effect of such acquisition or Transfer.

7.17 _Agent for Service of Process_.

 

(a) Without prejudice to any other permitted mode of service, each of the
Parent, the Shareholder and each Investor irrevocably agrees that service of
any claim form, notice or other document for the purpose of Section 7.13 shall
be duly served upon it if delivered personally or sent by pre-paid recorded
delivery, special delivery or registered post to AerCap Holdings N.V.,
AerCap House, Stationsplein 965, 1117 CE Schiphol, The Netherlands or such
other Person and address in The Netherlands as the Parent or the Shareholder
shall notify the Company of in writing from time to time and the parties agree
that failure by such appointed Person to notify their appointor of any such
service shall not invalidate the proceedings concerned.

(b) Without prejudice to any other permitted mode of service, the Company
irrevocably agrees that service of any claim form, notice or other document
for the purpose of Section 7.13 shall be duly served upon it if delivered
personally or sent by pre-paid recorded delivery, special delivery or
registered post to the Company at its address set forth in Section 7.2 or such
other Person and address in The Netherlands as the Company shall notify the
Parent and the Shareholder of in writing from time to time and the parties
agree that failure by such appointed Person to notify their appointor of any
such service shall not invalidate the proceedings concerned.

-i- __This REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, dated as of [ ], 2014 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is made between AerCap Holdings N.V., a public limited
liability company ( _naamloze vennootschap_ ) incorporated under the laws of
the Netherlands (together with its successors and permitted assigns, the "
_Company_ "), and American International Group, Inc., a Delaware Corporation
(together with its successors and permitted assigns, the " _Shareholder_ ").
_ _

A. On the date hereof, the Shareholder acquired 97,560,976 ordinary shares of
the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share (the " _Company Shares_ "),
pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2013 (the "
_Share Purchase Agreement_ "), among the Company, AerCap Ireland Ltd., the
Shareholder and AIG Capital Corporation. 

B. On the date hereof, the Company, the Shareholder, and the Parent are also
entering into a Shareholders Agreement (the " _Shareholders  Agreement_").

C. In connection with the Completion of the transactions under the Share
Purchase Agreement, the Company desires to grant to the Shareholder certain
registration rights in the United States with respect to the Company Shares
issued to the Shareholder pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement.

 

D. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement are used as defined in _Section
12_.

 

Now, therefore, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

1\. _Demand Registrations_.

 

(a) _Short-Form Registration._ After the date that is 210 days after the
Completion Date, so long as the Shareholder or any Investor holds Company
Shares and such shares are Registrable Securities and so long as the Company
is eligible to use Form F-3 or, if at such time the Company is not a "foreign
private issuer" within the meaning of Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act, Form
S-3 (or a comparable form) for the registration of its Company Shares, the
Shareholder may make one or more Registration Requests covering all or a
portion of the Registrable Securities held by it and the Investors pursuant to
a shelf registration for the sale or distribution of Registrable Securities
on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act
(a " _Shelf Registration_ "). Any Shelf Registration shall provide for the
resale of the Company Shares from time to time in the United States by and
pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to the
Shareholder and the Investors (including, without limitation, an underwritten
offering, a direct sale to purchasers, a sale to or through brokers, dealers
or agents, a sale over the internet, block trades, derivative transactions
with third parties, sales in connection with short sales and other hedging
transactions). The Company shall comply with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities
covered by the Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the intended
methods of disposition by the Shareholder and the Investors thereof.

(b) _Other Demand Registration_. After the date that is 210 days after the
Completion Date, so long as the Shareholder or any Investor holds Company
Shares and such shares are Registrable Securities, if the Company is not
eligible to use Form F-3 or Form S-3 (or a comparable form) for the
registration of its Company Shares, the Shareholder may make one or   more Registration Requests other than a Shelf Registration covering all or a
portion of the Registrable Securities held by it and the Investors pursuant to
the Securities Act. The Company shall comply with the applicable provisions
of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement in accordance with the
intended methods of disposition by the Shareholder and the Investors thereof.

(c) The Company, within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Company
receives a Registration Request given by the Shareholder in accordance with
_Section 1(a)_ or _Section 1(b)_ hereof, will file with the Commission, and
the Company will thereafter use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
declared effective as promptly as practicable, a Registration Statement on
the appropriate form for the registration and sale, in accordance with the
intended method or methods of distribution, of the total number of Registrable
Securities specified by the Shareholder in such Registration Request (it
being agreed that that the Registration Statement shall be an automatic shelf
registration statement that shall become effective upon filing with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act if Rule 462(e) is
available to the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
be obligated to give effect to any Registration Request if, in the Companys
reasonable judgment, it is not feasible for the Company to proceed with such
registration because of the unavailability of audited or other required
financial statements of the Company or any other Person; _provided_ , that the
Company shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to obtain such
financial statements as promptly as practicable.

(d) The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep each Shelf
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 1_ continuously
effective and usable for the resale of the Registrable Securities covered
thereby until the earlier of (i) three (3) years from the effective date of
such Shelf Registration Statement and (ii) the date on which all of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have been
sold pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement; _provided_ that, if on the
third (3rd) anniversary date of the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration
Statement Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement
remain unsold, the Company shall re-file such Shelf Registration upon its
expiration and keep such re-filed Shelf Registration Statement effective and
usable for the aforesaid period. The time period for which the Company is
required to maintain the effectiveness of any Registration Statement
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effectiveness Period_ ".

(e) After the date that is 270 days after the Completion Date, at any time
that any Shelf Registration is effective, if the Shareholder delivers a notice
to the Company (a " _Take-Down Notice_ ") stating that it (or any Investor)
intends to effect an underwritten offering or distribution of all or part of
its or their Registrable Securities included by it (or any Investor) on any
Shelf Registration (a " _Shelf Offering_ ") and stating the number of the
Registrable Securities to be included in the Shelf Offering, then the
Company shall amend or supplement the Shelf Registration as may be necessary
in order to enable such Registrable Securities to be distributed pursuant to
the Shelf Offering. In connection with any Shelf Offering, if the managing
underwriter(s) advise the Shareholder and the Investors in writing that in
its or their view the total number or dollar amount of Registrable Securities
proposed to be sold in such offering is such as to adversely affect the
success of such offering, the managing underwriter(s) may limit the number of
shares which would otherwise be included in such offering in the same manner
as

 



-2-  is described in _Section 1(h)_. The Company will pay all Registration
Expenses incurred in connection with any registration or underwritten offering
requested in accordance with this Agreement.

(f) _Selection of Underwriters._ If the Shareholder or the Investors intend to
distribute the Registrable Securities covered by any Registration Request or
Take-Down Notice by means of an underwritten offering, the Shareholder will so
advise the Company as a part of the Registration Request or Take-Down Notice.
Subject to the last sentence of this Section 1(f), the Company will not be
obligated to effect more than three (3) such underwritten offerings in any
12-month period. In connection with any such underwritten offering, (i) if
there are less than five total joint book-running managing underwriters, the
Company will have the right to appoint one such joint book-running managing
underwriter, and (ii) if there are five or more total joint book-running
managing underwriters, the Company will have the right to appoint two such
joint book-running managing underwriters, and in each case the Shareholder
will have the right to appoint the remaining joint book-running managing
underwriters; _provided_ , that each of the joint book-running
managing underwriters appointed pursuant hereto will have equally shared
responsibilities and economics, including for investor meetings and allocating
the order book with all other joint book-running managing underwriters. In
such an underwritten offering, the Shareholder and any Investor which holds
Registrable Securities which are to be sold in such offering (together with
the Company) will enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with
the underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering. If the
Shareholder disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, the Shareholder may
elect to withdraw therefrom (which withdrawal will also constitute a
withdrawal by all Investors) by written notice to the Company and the
joint book-running managing underwriters; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
attempted offering will count as one of the Shareholders three (3)
underwritten offerings described above. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, an attempted offering will not count as one of the
Shareholders three (3) underwritten offerings described above if the
Shareholders decision to withdraw from, terminate, abandon or cancel such
offering results from or arises out of an action by the Company that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the timing, marketability or
offering price of the securities contemplated to have been offered in such
registration.

 

(g) _Restrictions on Underwritten Offerings_. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 1_ to the contrary, the Shareholder and the Investors may not make,
and the Company will not be obligated to effect, an underwritten offering
unless the reasonably anticipated aggregate gross proceeds of such
underwritten offering are at least $100,000,000 (unless the Shareholder and
the Investors are proposing to sell all of their remaining Company Shares).
In addition, the Shareholder and the Investors may not, without the Companys
prior written consent:

 

(i) launch any offering within 120 days of any other underwritten offering of
Registrable Securities by the Shareholder or any Investor; and

(ii) offer or sell in any offering (including, if applicable, pursuant to the
exercise of any over-allotment or "green shoe" option) any Registrable
Securities that, without giving effect to the offering, would represent more
than 16% of the outstanding Company Shares at the time of such offering.

 



-3- (h) _Priority on Demand Registrations._ The Company will not include in any
underwritten registration pursuant to _Section 1_ any securities that are
not Registrable Securities without the prior written consent of the
Shareholder and each Investor. If the managing underwriter(s) advise the
Shareholder and the Investors in writing that in its or their opinion the
number of Registrable Securities (and, if permitted hereunder, other
securities requested to be included in such offering) exceeds the number of
securities that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
marketability of the offering, the Company will include in such offering only
such number of securities that can be sold without adversely affecting the
marketability of the offering, which securities will be so included in
the following order of priority: ( _i_ ) first, Registrable Securities of the
Shareholder or any Investor and ( _ii_ ) second, any other securities of the
Company that have been requested to be so included. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no employee of the Company or any subsidiary thereof will be
entitled to participate, directly or indirectly, in any such registration to
the extent that the managing underwriter(s) (or, in the case of any offering
that is not underwritten, a nationally recognized investment banking firm)
determines in good faith that the participation of such employee in such
registration would adversely affect the marketability or offering price of the
securities being sold in such registration.

 

2\. _Restrictions on Demand Registration._

 

(a) _Right to Defer or Suspend Registration._ In the event that the Company
determines in good faith that any one or more of the following circumstances
exist, the Company may, at its option, (x) defer any registration of
Registrable Securities in response to a Registration Request or (y) require
the Shareholder and the Investors to suspend any offerings of Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement for the periods specified:

(i) if the Company is subject to any of its customary suspension or blackout
periods, for all or part of such period;

(ii) if any offering would occur during the period commencing 15 days prior
to any scheduled investor day presentation and ending two days after the
furnishing to the SEC of the Form 6-K or Form 8-K reporting the substance of
such investor day presentation, for the duration of such period;

(iii) for not more than sixty (60) days in the aggregate in any 180-day
period, if the Company believes that an offering would require the Company,
under applicable securities laws and other laws, to make disclosures of
material non-public information that would not otherwise be required to be
disclosed at that time and the Company believes in good faith that such
disclosures at that time would not be in the Companys best interests;
_provided_ , that this exception shall continue to apply only during the time
that such material non-public information has not been disclosed and
remains material; _provided_ , _further_ , that upon disclosure of such
material non-public information, the Company shall (x) notify the Shareholder
and the Investors whose Registrable Securities are included in the
Registration Statement; (y) terminate any deferment or suspension it has put
into effect; and (z) take such actions necessary to permit registered sales of
Registrable Securities as required or contemplated by this Agreement,
including, if necessary, preparation and filing of a post-effective amendment
or prospectus supplement

 



-4-  so that the Registration Statement and any prospectus forming a part thereof
will not include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and

(iv) for not more than sixty (60) days in the aggregate in any 180-day
period, if the Company is pursuing a primary underwritten offering of Company
Shares pursuant to a Registration Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Shareholder and the Investors shall have Piggyback Registration Rights with
respect to such primary underwritten offering in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions set forth in _Section 3_.

 

(b) In addition, the Company shall have the right, exercisable at its option,
once in any 12-month period, to (x) defer any registration of Registrable
Securities, including the exercise of Piggyback Registration rights in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 3_, in
response to a Registration Request, or (y) require the Shareholder and the
Investors to suspend any offerings of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
Registration Statement for a period of not more than sixty (60) days from the
date of receipt of notice of such deferral or suspension, in each case, if the
Company elects at such time to offer Company Shares or Company Share
equivalents in order to:

(i) fund a merger, third party tender offer or exchange offer or other
business combination, acquisition of assets or similar transaction; or

(ii) meet rating agency and other capital funding requirements.

(c) _Limitation on Deferrals and Suspensions_. The Company shall not
be permitted to defer registration or require the Shareholder and the
Investors to suspend an offering pursuant to this _Section 2_ if the duration
of all such deferrals or suspensions would for any individual reason exceed
sixty (60) consecutive days or if the duration of all such deferrals or
suspensions would in the aggregate exceed one hundred ninety-five (195) days
in any 12-month period.

 

(d) If the Company defers any registration of Registrable Securities in
response to a Registration Request or Take-Down Notice or requires
the Shareholder or the Investors to suspend any offering of Registrable
Securities, the Shareholder and the Investors shall be entitled to withdraw
such Registration Request or such Take-Down Notice, as the case may be, and if
it does so, such request shall not be treated for any purpose as an exercise
of a Registration Request or the delivery of a Take-Down Notice pursuant to
_Section 1_ of this Agreement.

 

3\. _Piggyback Registrations._

 

(a) _Right to Piggyback._ After the date that is 270 days after the Completion
Date, whenever the Company proposes to register any of its securities (other
than (x) a registration pursuant to _Section 1_, relating solely to employee
benefit plans, or relating solely to the sale of debt or convertible debt
instruments or (y) an Excluded Offering) and the registration form to be
filed may be used for the registration or qualification for distribution of
Registrable Securities, the Company will give written notice at least fifteen
(15) days before the anticipated filing date to the Shareholder and the
Investors of its intention to effect such a registration and will include in
such registration all Registrable Securities held by the Shareholder and the
Investors with

 



-5-  respect to which the Company has received from the Shareholder a written
request for inclusion therein within ten (10) days after the date of the
Companys notice (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). If the Shareholder has
made such a written request, it may withdraw its or any Investors Registrable
Securities from such Piggyback Registration by giving written notice to the
Company and the managing underwriter(s), if any, on or before the fifth (5th)
day prior to the planned effective date of such Piggyback Registration. The
Company may terminate or withdraw any registration under this _Section 3_
prior to the effectiveness of such registration, whether or not the
Shareholder or any Investor has elected to include Registrable Securities in
such registration, and, except for the obligation to pay Registration Expenses
pursuant to _Section 3(c)_, the Company will have no liability to the
Shareholder or any Investor in connection with such termination or withdrawal.

(b) _Underwritten Registration._  If the registration referred to in _Section
3(a)_ is proposed to be underwritten, the Company will so advise the
Shareholder and the Investors as a part of the written notice given pursuant
to _Section 3(a)_. In such event, the right of the Shareholder and the
Investors to registration pursuant to this _Section 3_ will be conditioned
upon the Shareholders or such Investors participation in such underwriting
and the inclusion of the Shareholders or such Investors Registrable
Securities in the underwriting, and the Shareholder and any Investor which
holds Registrable Securities which are to be sold in such offering will
(together with the Company and any other holders distributing their
securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering
by the Company. If the Shareholder disapproves of the terms of the
underwriting, the Shareholder may elect to withdraw therefrom (which
withdrawal will also constitute a withdrawal by all Investors) by written
notice to the Company and the managing underwriter(s).

 

(c) _Piggyback Registration Expenses._ The Company will pay all Registration
Expenses in connection with any Piggyback Registration, whether or not any
registration or prospectus becomes effective or final.

(d) _Priority on Primary Registrations._ If a Piggyback Registration relates
to an underwritten primary offering on behalf of the Company, and the managing
underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion the number of
securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number
which can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of such
offering, the Company will include in such registration or prospectus only
such number of securities that in the opinion of such underwriters can be sold
without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, which
securities will be so included in the following order of priority: ( _i_ )
_first_ , the securities the Company proposes to sell and ( _ii_ ) _second_ ,
the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration by
the Shareholder or any Investor and other securities requested to be included
in such registration, _pro rata_ among the holders of Registrable Securities
and other securities on the basis of the number of securities owned by each
such holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employee of the Company or any
subsidiary thereof will not be entitled to participate, directly or
indirectly, in any such registration to the extent that the managing
underwriter(s) (or, in the case of an offering that is not underwritten, a
nationally recognized investment banking firm) will determine in good faith
that the participation of such employee in such registration would adversely
affect the marketability or offering price of the securities being sold in
such registration.

 



-6- (e) _Priority on Secondary Registrations._ If a Piggyback Registration relates
to an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of other holders of the
Companys securities, and the managing underwriters advise the Company in
writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be
included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold without
adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, the Company will
include in such registration only such number of securities that in the
opinion of such underwriters can be sold without adversely affecting the
marketability of the offering, which securities will be so included in the
following order of priority: ( _i_ ) _first_ , the securities requested to be
included therein by the holders requesting such registration and ( _ii_ )
_second_ , the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by the Shareholder or any Investor and other securities requested
to be included in such registration, _pro rata_ among the holders
of Registrable Securities and other securities on the basis of the number of
securities owned by each such holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
employee of the Company or any subsidiary thereof will not be entitled to
participate, directly or indirectly, in any such registration to the extent
that the managing underwriter(s) (or, in the case of an offering that is not
underwritten, a nationally recognized investment banking firm) will determine
in good faith that the participation of such employee in such registration
would adversely affect the marketability or offering price of the securities
being sold in such registration.

 

4\. _Holdback Agreement._

 

(a) If (i) during the Effectiveness Period, the Company shall file a
Registration Statement (other than in connection with the registration of
securities issuable pursuant to an employee stock option, stock purchase or
similar plan or pursuant to a merger, exchange offer or a transaction of the
type specified in Rule 145(a) under the Securities Act) with respect to
an underwritten public offering of Company Shares or securities convertible
into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, such securities, (ii) with
reasonable prior notice, the managing underwriter or underwriters advises the
Company in writing (in which case the Company shall notify the Shareholder
and the Investors) that a public sale or distribution of Registrable
Securities would materially adversely impact such offering and (iii) the
underwriter or underwriters have obtained written holdback agreements from
the Company, each executive officer of the Company and each other person who
has been granted registration rights by the Company, then the Shareholder and
each Investor shall, if requested by the Company and the managing underwriter
or underwriters, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, refrain
from effecting any public sale or distribution of Registrable Securities,
without the prior written consent of the Company and the managing underwriter
or underwriters, during the ten (10) days prior to the effective date of such
Registration Statement and until the earliest of (A) sixty (60) days from the
effective date of such Registration Statement; _provided_ , that if
the managing underwriter or underwriters, in its or their reasonable
judgment, advises the Company that a period of sixty (60) days from the
effective date is too short, this sixty (60) day period may be extended by the
Company at the direction of the managing underwriter or underwriters by up to
an aggregate of thirty (30) additional days or (B) the abandonment of such
offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any obligations of the Shareholder
and each Investor under this _Section 4_ shall terminate in the event that
the Company or any underwriter terminates, releases or waives, in whole or in
part, the holdback agreements with respect to the Company, any executive
officer of the Company or any such other person who has been granted
registration rights by the Company; and

 



-7- (b) The Company, if requested in writing by the managing underwriter or
underwriters in connection with an underwritten public offering of
Registrable Securities by the Shareholder or any Investor, shall not make any
public sale or other distribution of Company Shares or securities convertible
into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Company Shares (other than
offerings in connection with the registration of securities issuable pursuant
to an employee stock option, stock purchase or similar plan or pursuant to a
merger, exchange offer or a transaction of the type specified in Rule 145(a)
under the Securities Act) during the ten (10) days prior to the pricing date
of such underwritten public offering and until the earliest of (A) sixty (60)
days from the pricing date of such underwritten public offering;  _provided_
, that if the managing underwriter or underwriters, in its or their reasonable
judgment, advises the Shareholder that a period of sixty (60) days from the
pricing date is too short, this sixty (60) day period may be extended by the
Shareholder at the direction of the managing underwriter or underwriters by up
to an aggregate of thirty (30) additional days or (B) the abandonment of such
offering.

 

5\. _Registration Procedures._ In connection with the registration obligations
of the Company pursuant to and in accordance with  _Section 1_, the Company
will use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration and sale
of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of
disposition thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company will, as expeditiously as possible:

(a) prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement with
respect to such Registrable Securities, subject to _Section 1(c)_ of this
Agreement, make all required filings with FINRA and thereafter use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to
become effective upon filing but in any event not later than thirty (30) days
after the filing of such Registration Statement; _provided_ , that before
filing a Registration Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto
(other than reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act that
are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference into the
Registration Statement), the Company will furnish to the Shareholder and the
Investors copies of all documents proposed to be filed. If the Shareholder
informs the Company in writing within five Business Days that it has any
objections to the filing of such Registration Statement, amendment or
supplement, the Company will not file such Registration Statement, amendment
or supplement prior to the date that is five Business Days from the date the
Shareholder and the Investors received such document. The Company will not
file any Registration Statement or amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement to which the Shareholder will have reasonably objected
in writing on the grounds that (and explaining why) such amendment or
supplement does not comply in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act or of the rules or regulations thereunder;

(b) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
such Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement effective for a period of either ( _i_ ) not less than the
Effectiveness Period or, if such Registration Statement relates to an
underwritten offering, such longer period as in the opinion of counsel for
the underwriters a prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection
with sales of Registrable Securities by an underwriter or dealer or ( _ii_ )
such shorter period as will terminate when all of the securities covered by
such Registration

 



-8-  Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of
disposition by the Shareholder or any Investor, as applicable, set forth in
such Registration Statement (but in any event not before the expiration of
any longer period required under the Securities Act), and to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by such Registration Statement until such time as all of
such securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods
of disposition by the Shareholder and any Investor, as applicable, set forth
in such Registration Statement;

 

(c) furnish to the Shareholder and the Investors, without charge, such number
of conformed copies of such Registration Statement and of each post-effective
amendment thereto, and deliver, without charge, such number of copies of each
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, all exhibits and other documents
filed therewith and such other documents as the Shareholder and the Investors
may reasonably request including in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities owned by it or any Investor;

 

(d) use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify such
Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions as the Shareholder and the Investors reasonably request in
writing ( _provided_ that the Company will not be required to ( _i_ ) qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify but for this subsection, ( _ii_ ) subject itself to
taxation in any such jurisdiction or ( _iii_ ) consent to general service of
process in any such jurisdiction);

 

(e) promptly notify the Shareholder and the Investors, at any time when a
prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act, upon discovery that, or upon the discovery of the happening of any event
as a result of which, the prospectus contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and,
as promptly as practicable, prepare and furnish to the Shareholder and the
Investors a reasonable number of copies of a supplement or amendment to
such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such
Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made;

(f) promptly notify the Shareholder and the Investors ( _i_ ) when the
prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been
filed and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment, when the same has become effective, ( _ii_ ) of any request by the
Commission for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or to
amend or to supplement such prospectus or for additional information, ( _iii_
) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending
the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the initiation of any
proceedings for such purpose, (iv) of the receipt by the Company or its legal
counsel of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any

 



-9-  proceeding for such purpose and (v) the happening of any event that requires
the Company to make changes in any effective Registration Statement or the
Prospectus related to the Registration Statement to make changes necessary to
make the statements in such Registration Statement not misleading or the
statements in such Prospectus not misleading in light of the circumstances in
which they were made (which notice shall be accompanied by an instruction to
suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes have been made);

(g) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable
Securities to be listed on each securities exchange, if any, on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed or, if no similar securities
issued by the Company are then listed on any securities exchange, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities to be
listed on such securities exchange reasonably selected by the Company;

 

(h) enter into such customary agreements (including underwriting agreements in
form, scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings) and take
all such appropriate and reasonable other actions as the Shareholder, the
Investors or the underwriters, if any, reasonably request in order to expedite
or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities; 

(i) if such offering is an underwritten offering, make available for
inspection by the Shareholder, the Investors, any underwriter participating
in any disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement and any attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by the Shareholder and the Investors or any
such underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents of the Company as will be reasonably necessary to enable them to
exercise their due diligence responsibilities, _provided_ that each of the
Shareholder, any such underwriter and any attorney, accountant or other
agent retained by the Shareholder or any such underwriter will enter into a
confidentiality agreement satisfactory to the Company;

 

(j) otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement
covering the period of at least twelve months beginning with the first day of
the Companys first full calendar quarter after the effective date of the
Registration Statement, which earnings statement will satisfy the provisions
of Section 11(a) of the U.S. Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder;

 

(k) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or of any order suspending or
preventing the use of any related prospectus or ceasing trading of any
securities included in such Registration Statement for sale in any
jurisdiction, use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to obtain the
withdrawal of such order at the earliest practicable time;

(l) enter into such agreements and take such other actions as the Shareholder,
the Investors or the underwriters reasonably request in order to expedite or
facilitate the

 



-10-  disposition of such Registrable Securities, including, without limitation,
preparing for and participating in such number of "road shows", and all such
other customary selling efforts as the underwriters reasonably request in
order to expedite or facilitate such disposition, including, as the
underwriters reasonably request, making members of senior management of the
Company, as would customarily participate in "road show" and other customary
marketing activities for an offering by the Company comparable to such
offering in size and type of securities offered, cooperate with the managing
underwriters or underwriter and make themselves available to participate on a
reasonable basis in "road show" and other customary marketing activities in
such locations (domestic and foreign) as recommended by the managing
underwriters or underwriter (including one-on-one meetings with
prospective purchasers of the Registrable Securities);

(m) if such offering is an underwritten offering, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain one or more comfort letters, addressed to the
underwriters, the Shareholder and the Investors ( _provided_ that the
Companys independent public accountants will address a comfort letter to the
Shareholder and the Investors), dated the effective date of, or the date of
the final receipt issued for such Registration Statement (the date of the
closing under the underwriting agreement for such offering), signed by the
Companys independent public accountants in customary form and covering such
matters of the type customarily covered by comfort letters in underwritten
offerings;

 

(n) if such offering is an underwritten offering, use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide legal opinions of the Companys outside counsel, addressed
to the underwriters, dated the effective date of, or the date of the final
receipt issued for such Registration Statement (the date of the closing under
the underwriting agreement for such offering), each amendment and supplement
thereto, with respect to the Registration Statement, each amendment and
supplement thereto (including the preliminary prospectus) and such other
documents relating thereto in customary form and covering such matters of
the type customarily covered by legal opinions of such nature;

(o) make available to the Shareholder and the Investors each item of
correspondence from the Commission or the staff of the Commission (or other
governmental agency or self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction,
including any domestic or foreign securities exchange) and each item of
correspondence written by or on behalf of the Company to the Commission or
the staff of the Commission (or other governmental agency or self-regulatory
body or other body having jurisdiction, including any domestic or foreign
securities exchange), in each case relating to such Registration Statement,
other than, in each case, any item of correspondence relating to any reports
delivered or required to be delivered under the Exchange Act whether or not in
connection with such Registration Statement; and 

(p) use its commercially reasonable efforts to procure the cooperation of the
Companys transfer agent in settling any Transfer of Registrable Securities,
including with respect to the transfer of any physical stock certificates
representing common stock into book-entry form in accordance with any
procedures reasonably requested by the Shareholder or the Investors or the
underwriters.

 



-11- The Company agrees not to file or make any amendment to any Registration
Statement with respect to any Registrable Securities, or any amendment of or
supplement to the prospectus used in connection therewith, that refers to the
Shareholder or any Investor by name, or otherwise identifies the Shareholder
or any Investor as the holder of any securities of the Company, without the
consent of the Shareholder (any such consent to be binding on each Investor),
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless and to the
extent such disclosure is required by applicable law.

 

The Company may require the Shareholder and any Investor to furnish the
Company with such information regarding the Shareholder and such Investor
and pertinent to the disclosure requirements relating to the registration and
the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time
reasonably request in writing. If within 20 days of the receipt of a written
request from the Company, the Shareholder or any Investor fails to provide to
the Company any information relating to the Shareholder or such Investor, as
applicable, that is required by applicable law to be disclosed in the
Registration Statement, the Company may exclude the Shareholders and such
Investors, as applicable, Registrable Securities from such Registration
Statement.

The Shareholder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of
the happening of any event of the kind described in _Section 5(e), 5(f)(ii)_
or _5(f)(iii)_ hereof, that the Shareholder shall discontinue, and shall cause
each Investor to discontinue, disposition of any Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement or the related prospectus until receipt
of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by
_Section 5(c)_ hereof, which supplement or amendment shall be prepared and
furnished as soon as reasonably practicable, or until the Shareholder and the
Investors are advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable
prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any amended or
supplemented prospectus or any additional or supplemental filings which are
incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference in such prospectus
(such period during which disposition is discontinued being an "
_Interruption Period_ ") and, if requested by the Company, the Shareholder
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to return to the Company all
copies then in its possession or in the possession of any Investor, other than
permanent file copies then in such holders possession, of the prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such request.
As soon as practicable after the Company has determined that the use of the
applicable prospectus may be resumed, the Company will notify the Shareholder
and the Investors. In the event the Company invokes an Interruption Period
hereunder and in the reasonable discretion of the Company the need for the
Company to continue the Interruption Period ceases for any reason, the
Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, provide written notice to
the Shareholder and the Investors that such Interruption Period is no longer
applicable. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary,
no Interruption Period shall exceed sixty (60) days and, in any calendar
year, no more than one hundred ninety-five (195) days in the aggregate may be
part of an Interruption Period.

 

6\. _Registration Expenses._

 

(a) All expenses incidental to the Companys performance of or compliance with
this Agreement, including, without limitation, all registration and filing
fees, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, word
processing, duplicating and printing expenses,

 



-12-  messenger and delivery expenses, the fees and disbursements of counsel for
the Company, all independent certified public accountants, underwriters and
other Persons retained by the Shareholder and the Investors, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to represent the Shareholder and
the Investors selected by the Shareholder, and all transportation and other
expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Shareholder, any Investor, the
Company or any underwriters, or their representatives, in connection with
"roadshow" presentations and the holding of meetings with potential investors
to facilitate the distribution and sale of the Registrable Securities (all
such expenses, " _Registration Expenses_ "), will be borne as provided in this
Agreement, except that the Company will, in any event, pay its internal
expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of
its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the
expenses of any annual audit or quarterly review, the expenses of any
liability insurance and the expenses and fees for listing the securities to be
registered on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by
the Company are then listed or on the New York Stock Exchange.

(b) Selling Expenses will be borne by the Shareholder and the Investors, as
applicable.

7\. _Indemnification._

 

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, and hereby does
indemnify and hold harmless, the Shareholder and the Investors,
their affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
partners and each Person who controls the Shareholder and the Investors
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) against, and pay and reimburse the
Shareholder and the Investors, affiliate, director, officer, employee or
partner or controlling person for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
joint or several, to which the Shareholder and the Investors or any such
affiliate, director, officer, employee or partner or controlling person may
become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced
or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any
untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, or any "issuer free writing prospectus" as
such term is defined under Rule 433 under the Securities Act or ( _ii_ ) any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and the Company
will pay and reimburse the Shareholder and the Investors and each such
affiliate, director, officer, employee, partner and controlling person for any
legal or any other expenses actually and reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating, defending or settling any such loss, claim,
liability, action or proceeding; _provided_ that the Company will not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage,
liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out
of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or
omission or alleged omission, made in such Registration Statement, any such
prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,
or any "issuer free writing prospectus" as such term is defined under Rule
433 under the Securities Act, or in any application, in reliance upon, and in
conformity with, written information prepared and furnished to the Company by
the Shareholder or any Investor expressly for use therein. In connection with
an underwritten offering, the Company, if requested, will indemnify such
underwriters, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such
underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Shareholder and the
Investors.

 



-13- (b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Shareholder or
any Investor is participating, the Shareholder and each Investor will furnish
to the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company
reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement
or prospectus and will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors
and officers, each underwriter and each other Person who controls the Company
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) and each such underwriter against
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, to which the
Company or any such director or officer, any such underwriter or controlling
person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon ( _i_ ) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in the Registration Statement, prospectus or
preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or in
any application or ( _ii_ ) any omission or alleged omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission
is made in such Registration Statement, any such prospectus or preliminary
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information prepared and
furnished to the Company by the Shareholder or any Investor expressly for use
therein, and the Shareholder and any such Investor will reimburse the Company
and each such director, officer, underwriter and controlling Person for
any legal or any other expenses actually and reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating, defending or settling any such loss, claim,
liability, action or proceeding; _provided_ that the obligation to indemnify
and hold harmless will be limited to the net amount of proceeds received by
the Shareholder and each Investor (in the aggregate) from the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.

 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will ( _i_ ) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification and ( _ii_ ) unless in such indemnified partys
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the
indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not
be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or
elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by
such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between
such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
to such claim.

(d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such
indemnified party and will survive the registration and sale of any securities
by any Person entitled to any indemnification hereunder and the expiration or
termination of this Agreement.

 



-14- (e) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7_ is legally
unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability,
claim, damage or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in
lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, will contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of
the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or
omissions which resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party will be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the amount the Shareholder and any Investor will be obligated to contribute
pursuant to this  _Section 7(e)_ will be limited to an amount equal to the
proceeds received by the Shareholder and each Investor (in the aggregate) in
respect of the Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the Registration
Statement which gives rise to such obligation to contribute (less the
aggregate amount of any damages which the Shareholder and each Investor has
otherwise been required to pay in respect of such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action or any substantially similar loss, claim, damage,
liability or action arising from the sale of such Registrable Securities).

8\. _Participation in Underwritten Registrations._  

(a) Neither the Shareholder nor any Investor may participate in any
registration hereunder that is underwritten unless each of the Shareholder
and any such Investor ( _i_ ) completes and executes all customary
questionnaires, powers of attorney, underwriting agreements and other
customary documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements and ( _ii_ ) cooperates with the Companys requests in
connection with such registration or qualification (it being understood that
the Companys failure to perform its obligations hereunder, which failure is
caused by the Shareholders or any Investors failure to cooperate, will not
constitute a breach by the Company of this Agreement).

(b) To the extent that the Shareholder or any Investor is participating in
any registration hereunder, the Shareholder agrees that, upon receipt of any
notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
_Section 5(e)_ above, the Shareholder will, and will cause any such Investor
to, forthwith discontinue the disposition of its Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Registration Statement until the Shareholder and the Investors
receive copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus as contemplated by
such _Section 5(e)_.

9\. _Rule 144 and 144A Reporting._

 

(a) With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and
regulations of the Commission which may permit the sale of the Registrable
Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Commission in a timely manner
all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act and keep public information available at any time
when the Company is subject to such reporting requirements.

 



-15- Upon request of the Shareholder or the Investors, the Company will deliver to
the Shareholder and the Investors a written statement as to whether it has
complied with such informational and reporting requirements and will, within
the limitations of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 (as such rule may be
amended from time to time) or any similar rule enacted by the Commission,
instruct the transfer agent to remove the restrictive legend affixed to any
Company Shares to enable such shares to be sold in compliance with Rule 144
(as such rule may be amended from time to time) or any similar rule enacted
by the Commission.

(b) For purposes of facilitating sales pursuant to Rule 144A, so long as the
Company is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act, the Shareholder, each Investor and any prospective
purchaser of the Shareholders or any Investors securities will have the
right to obtain from the Company, upon written request of the Shareholder
prior to the time of sale, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of the Company, and such other reports and documents that the Company
would have been required to file if the Company were subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as the Shareholder,
the Investors or prospective purchaser may reasonably request in writing in
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing
the Shareholder or any Investor, as applicable, to sell any such securities
without registration.

10\. _Term._ This Agreement will be effective as of the date hereof and will
continue in effect thereafter until the earliest of ( _a_ ) its termination by
the written consent of the parties hereto or their respective successors in
interest, ( _b_ ) the date on which no Registrable Securities remain
outstanding and ( _c_ ) the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
Company.

11.  _Governing Law, Dispute Resolution and Jurisdiction._

(a) This Agreement, all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
all claims and defenses of any nature (including contractual and non-
contractual claims and defenses) arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and the formation,
applicability, breach, termination or validity of this Agreement, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would apply the
Law of another jurisdiction.

 

(b) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with, or
relating to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the formation, applicability, breach, termination or validity
thereof, shall be finally settled exclusively by arbitration in accordance
with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "
_ICC_ ") in effect at the time of the arbitration, except as they may be
modified herein or by mutual agreement of the parties. The arbitration shall
be conducted by three arbitrators (the " _Arbitral Tribunal_ ").
The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language and the seat of
the arbitration shall be New York, New York.

(c) The party or parties initiating arbitration (the " _Claimant(s)_ ") shall
nominate an arbitrator in its (their) request for arbitration (the "
_Arbitration Request_ "). The party or parties named as Respondent(s) in the
Arbitration Request (the " _Respondent(s)_ ") shall nominate an arbitrator
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Arbitration Request and shall notify
the Claimant(s) of such nomination in writing. If within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the Arbitration

 



-16-  Request by the Respondent(s), the Respondent(s) has (have) not nominated an
arbitrator, then the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC (the " _ICC
Court_ ") shall appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the Respondent(s). The
first two arbitrators nominated by the parties or appointed by the ICC Court
in accordance with the above shall nominate a third arbitrator within thirty
(30) days of the confirmation by the ICC Court (or appointment in accordance
with the above) of the arbitrator nominated/appointed on behalf of the
Respondent(s). When the third arbitrator has accepted the nomination, the
other two arbitrators shall promptly notify the parties of the nomination. If
the first two arbitrators nominated/appointed fail to nominate a third
arbitrator within the thirty (30) days referred to above, the ICC Court shall
appoint the third arbitrator and shall promptly notify the parties of
the appointment. The third arbitrator shall act as chair of the Arbitral
Tribunal. Each arbitrator shall be qualified to practice law under the Laws of
the State of New York. An arbitrator shall be deemed to have met these
qualifications unless any party objects within fifteen (15) days.

(d) The parties agree that any Award by the Arbitral Tribunal on interim
measures shall be fully enforceable as such and an application for interim
measures to a court of competent jurisdiction by any party to the arbitration
shall not be deemed incompatible with, or a waiver of, the agreement to
arbitrate set out in this  _Section 11_.

(e) In order to facilitate the comprehensive resolution of related disputes
and to avoid inconsistent decisions in related disputes, upon request of any
party to an arbitration proceeding commenced pursuant to this _Section 11_,
any dispute, controversy or claim subsequently noticed for arbitration under
the provisions of this Section may be consolidated with the earlier-commenced
arbitration proceeding, as determined within the discretion of the Arbitral
Tribunal appointed in the first-commenced arbitration proceeding. The Arbitral
Tribunal must not consolidate such arbitrations unless the Arbitral Tribunal
determines that (i) there are issues of fact or law common to the proceedings,
so that a consolidated proceeding would be more efficient than separate
proceedings, and (ii) no party hereto would be prejudiced as a result of such
consolidation through undue delay, conflict of interest or otherwise. If the
Arbitral Tribunal and any arbitration tribunal appointed in a subsequent
arbitration proceeding disagree as to whether their respective arbitrations
should be consolidated there shall be no consolidation.

(f) Subject to _clause 17.3_ of the Share Purchase Agreement, the parties, the
ICC Court, any arbitrator, and their agents or Representatives, shall keep
confidential and not disclose to any non-party the existence of the
arbitration, non-public materials and information provided in the arbitration
by another party, and orders or awards made in the arbitration (together, the
" _Arbitration Confidential Information_ "). If a party or an arbitrator
wishes to involve in the arbitration a non-party  including a fact or expert
witness, stenographer, translator or any other person  the party or
arbitrator shall make reasonable efforts to secure the non-partys advance
agreement to preserve the confidentiality of the Arbitration Confidential
Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose Arbitration
Confidential Information to the extent necessary to: (i) prosecute or defend
the arbitration or proceedings related to it (including enforcement or
annulment proceedings), or to pursue a legal right; (ii) respond to
a compulsory order or request for information of a governmental or regulatory
body; (iii) make disclosure required by law or by the rules of a securities
exchange; (iv) seek legal, accounting or other professional services, or
satisfy information requests of potential acquirers, investors or lenders,
provided that in each case of any disclosure allowed under the foregoing
circumstances (i)

 



-17-  through (iv), where possible, the producing party takes reasonable measures
to ensure that the recipient preserves the confidentiality of the information
provided. The Arbitral Tribunal may permit further disclosure of Arbitration
Confidential Information where there is a demonstrated need to disclose that
outweighs any partys legitimate interest in preserving confidentiality. This
confidentiality provision survives termination of this Agreement and of any
arbitration brought pursuant to this Agreement. This confidentiality provision
may be enforced by an arbitral tribunal or any court of competent
jurisdiction, and an application to a court to enforce this provision
shall not waive or in any way derogate from the agreement to arbitrate set
out in this _Section 11_.

(g) If there is any dispute as to whether a dispute, controversy or claim is
subject to arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to
decide the same.

 

(h) The agreement to arbitrate under this _Section 11_ shall be specifically
enforceable. Any Award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal shall be in writing
and shall be final and binding upon the parties, and may include an award of
costs, including reasonable legal fees and disbursements, to the prevailing
party. The parties undertake to carry out any Award without delay and waive
their right to any form of recourse based on grounds other than those
contained in the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement
of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958 insofar as such waiver can validly be made.

Agreement. For a period of thirty months after the Completion Date, the
Company shall not grant to any Person the right to require the Company to
register any equity securities of the Company, or any securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for such securities, without the approval
of the Shareholder, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ ,
that this sentence will be of no further force and effect if, at any time
prior to the commencement of the Nine Month Restricted Period, the Company
irrevocably waives in writing the requirement set forth in _Section
1(g)(ii)_.

 

(b) _Adjustments Affecting Registrable Securities_. The Company will not on
its own initiative, except to the extent required by applicable law or an
enforceable court order, propose any of the following actions to be taken by
the general meeting of shareholders, after the date of this Agreement with
respect to the Company Shares as a class if such actions would materially and
adversely affect the ability of the Shareholder or the Investors to include
the Registrable Securities in a registration undertaken pursuant to this
Agreement: (i) implementing transfer restrictions on the Company Shares, (ii)

by the general meeting of shareholders (and not initiated by the Board of
Directors of the Company), whether or not pursuant to articles 2:110 or 2:114A
of the Dutch Civil Code, shall not be deemed to be a violation of this
_Section 13(b)_.

 



-21- (c) _Dilution_. If, from time to time, there is any change in the capital
structure of the Company by way of a split, dividend, combination or
reclassification, or through a merger, consolidation, reorganization or
recapitalization, or by any other means, appropriate adjustment shall be made
in the provisions hereof so that the rights and privileges granted hereby
shall continue.

(d) _Remedies_. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that money damages
may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this
Agreement and that any party hereto will have the right to injunctive relief,
in addition to all of its other rights and remedies at law or in equity, to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, _provided_ that neither the
Shareholder nor any Investor will have any right to an injunction to prevent
the filing or effectiveness of any Registration Statement of the Company,
other than a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Agreement in
response to a Registration Request.

(e) _Amendments and Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
the provisions of this Agreement may be amended or waived only upon the prior
written consent of the Company and the Shareholder. No failure or delay by any
party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

 

(f) _Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights of the Shareholder and any
Investor to registration of all or any portion of its Registrable Securities
pursuant to this Agreement may be assigned by the Shareholder or such Investor
to any Permitted Transferee to the extent of the Registrable Securities
Transferred as long as (i) the Shareholder or such Investor, within ten (10)
days after such Transfer, furnishes to the Company written notice of the
Transfer to the Permitted Transferee and (ii) such Permitted Transferee
agrees, following such Transfer, to be subject to all applicable restrictions
and obligations set forth in this Agreement, and executes a customary joinder
to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
in which case the applicable Permitted Transferee shall be the beneficiary to
all rights of the Shareholder or such Investor and subject to all
restrictions and obligations applicable to the Shareholder or such Investor
pursuant to this Agreement, to the same extent as the Shareholder or such
Investor.

 

(g) _Successors and Assigns_. Except as provided in _Section 13(f)_ hereof,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder shall
be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. If any of the
Registrable Securities is converted into or exchanged or substituted for other
securities issued by any other Person, as a condition to the effectiveness of
the merger, consolidation, reclassification, share exchange of other
transaction pursuant to which such conversion, exchange, substitution or other
transaction takes place, such other Person shall become bound hereby with
respect to such other securities which shall constitute Registrable
Securities.

(h) _Conversion of Other Securities_. If the Shareholder or any Investor
offers Registrable Securities by forward sale, or by an offering (directly or
by entering into a derivative

 



-22-  transaction with a broker-dealer or other financial institution) of any
options, rights, warrants or other securities that are offered with,
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any Registrable
Securities, the Registrable Securities subject to such forward sale or
underlying such options, rights or warrants or other securities shall be
eligible for registration pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(i) _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or the effectiveness or validity of any provision in any
other jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and
enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained herein.

(j) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and
the same Agreement.

(k)  _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings of this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.

 

(l) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Shareholders Agreement
constitute the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, between
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

(m) _Notices_. All notices, demands or other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement will be in
writing and will be deemed to have been given when personally delivered or
received by certified mail, return receipt requested, or sent by guaranteed
overnight courier service. Such notices, demands and other
communications will be sent to the Company, the Shareholder and the Investors
in the manner and at the addresses set forth in the Shareholders Agreement.

(i) make and keep books, records and accounts which, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets

of Control and continued beyond such period), AIG shall have reasonable
access, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, to

GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION

 

Section 6.01 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, all transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and all claims and defenses of any nature (including
contractual and non-contractual claims and defenses) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
and the formation, applicability, breach, termination or validity of
this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflicts of law
principles that would apply the Law of another jurisdiction.

 

Section 6.02 _Arbitration_.

 

(a) Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising from, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or validity
thereof shall be finally settled by arbitration before three arbitrators (the
" _Arbitral Tribunal_ ") in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce in effect at the time of the arbitration
except as they may be modified herein or by mutual agreement of the Parties.
The seat of the arbitration shall be New York, New York, and the arbitration
shall be conducted in the English language.

 

(b) The claimants shall nominate an arbitrator in its (their) Request for
Arbitration. The respondent(s) in the Arbitration Request shall nominate an
arbitrator within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Arbitration Request and
shall notify the claimant(s) of such nomination in writing. If within thirty
(30) days of receipt of the Arbitration Request by the respondent(s),
the respondent(s) has (have) not nominated an arbitrator, then the
International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce
(the " _ICC Court_ ") shall appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the
respondent(s). The first two arbitrators nominated by the Parties or
appointed by the ICC Court in accordance with the above shall nominate a third
arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the confirmation by the ICC Court (or
appointment in accordance with the above) of the arbitrator
nominated/appointed on behalf of the respondent(s). When the third arbitrator
has accepted the nomination, the other two arbitrators shall promptly notify
the Parties of the nomination. If the first two arbitrators
nominated/appointed fail to nominate a third arbitrator within the thirty
(30) days referred to above, the ICC Court shall appoint the third arbitrator
and shall promptly notify the Parties of the appointment. The third arbitrator
shall act as chair of the Arbitral Tribunal. Each arbitrator shall be
qualified to practice law under the Laws of the State of New York. An
arbitrator shall be deemed to have met these qualifications unless any Party
objects within fifteen (15) days.

 

(c) The Parties agree that any award by the Arbitral Tribunal on interim
measures shall be fully enforceable as such and an application for interim
measures to a court of competent jurisdiction by any Party to the arbitration
shall not be deemed incompatible with, or a waiver of, the agreement to
arbitrate set out in this Section 6.02.

 



-11- (d) In order to facilitate the comprehensive resolution of related disputes
and to avoid inconsistent decisions in related disputes, upon request of any
Party to an arbitration proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 6.02,
any dispute, controversy or claim subsequently noticed for arbitration under
the provisions of this Section 6.02 may be consolidated with the earlier-
commenced arbitration proceeding, as determined within the discretion of the
Arbitral Tribunal appointed in the first-commenced arbitration proceeding. The
Arbitral Tribunal must not consolidate such arbitrations unless the Arbitral
Tribunal determines that (i) there are issues of fact or law common to the
proceedings, so that a consolidated proceeding would be more efficient than
separate proceedings, and (ii) no Party hereto would be prejudiced as a
result of such consolidation through undue delay, conflict of interest or
otherwise. If the Arbitral Tribunal and any arbitration tribunal appointed in
a subsequent arbitration proceeding disagree as to whether their respective
arbitrations should be consolidated there shall be no consolidation.

(e) Subject to clause 17.3 of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Parties, the
ICC Court, any arbitrator, and their agents or representatives, shall keep
confidential and not disclose to any non-Party any confidential information,
including but not limited to the existence of the arbitration, non-public
materials and information provided in the arbitration by another Party, and
orders or awards made in the arbitration. If a Party or an arbitrator wishes
to involve in the arbitration a non-Party - including a fact or expert
witness, stenographer, translator or any other person - the Party or
arbitrator shall make reasonable efforts to secure the non-Partys advance
agreement to preserve the confidentiality of the confidential information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may disclose confidential information
to the extent necessary to: (i) prosecute or defend the arbitration or
proceedings related to it (including enforcement or annulment proceedings), or
to pursue a legal right; (ii) respond to a compulsory order or request for
information of a governmental or regulatory body; (iii) make disclosure
required by law or by the rules of a securities exchange; (iv) seek legal,
accounting or other professional services, or satisfy information requests of
potential acquirers, investors or lenders, provided that in each case of any
disclosure allowed under the foregoing circumstances (i) through (iv), where
possible, the producing Party takes reasonable measures to ensure that the
recipient preserves the confidentiality of the information provided. The
Arbitral Tribunal may permit further disclosure of confidential information
where there is a demonstrated need to disclose that outweighs any Partys
legitimate interest in preserving confidentiality. This confidentiality
provision survives termination of this Agreement and of any arbitration
brought pursuant to this Agreement. This confidentiality provision may be
enforced by an arbitral tribunal or any court of competent jurisdiction, and
an application to a court to enforce this provision shall not waive or in any
way derogate from the agreement to arbitrate set out in this Section 6.02.

 

(f) The arbitration shall be conducted in an expedited manner. There shall be
one round of pre-hearing submissions by each Party, whether simultaneous or
sequential as directed by the Arbitral Tribunal, and no reply or rejoinder
submissions shall be made unless the Arbitral Tribunal expressly so
authorizes. The arbitration hearing shall be held within four months of the
constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and shall continue, to the extent
practicable, from Business Day to Business Day until completed. There shall be

 



-12-  no post-hearing submissions except as directed by the Arbitral Tribunal, and
before ordering such submissions, the Arbitral Tribunal shall identify for the
Parties, on the basis of its assessment of the case as of that time, the
specific issues or matters it believes should be addressed. The Arbitral
Tribunal shall endeavor to render its Award within six weeks of the last day
of the arbitration hearing. The Arbitral Tribunal may modify the provisions
of this schedule for good cause shown. Failure to comply with any time period
set out in this Section 6.02(f) shall not affect in any way the jurisdiction
of the Arbitral Tribunal or the validity of its award.

 

(g) Any request for production of documents or other information shall be
subject to the express authorization of the Arbitral Tribunal, which shall
endeavor to ensure that any such requests are as limited and disciplined as is
consistent with the just resolution of the dispute, controversy or claim. The
Parties expressly waive any right to seek evidence under Section 1782 of title
28 of the U.S. Code or any other provision contained in the arbitration or
other procedural rules or Laws of any jurisdiction. A Party may request, and
the Arbitral Tribunal should authorize, production only of specific documents
or narrow and specific categories of documents that are critical to the fair
presentation of a Partys case and reasonably believed to exist and be in the
possession, custody or control of the other Party.

 

(h) If there is any dispute as to whether a dispute, controversy or claim is
subject to arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to
decide the same.

(i) The Arbitral Tribunal shall have power to make any award that it deems
just and appropriate, including specific performance or injunctive relief.

(j) The agreement to arbitrate under this Section 6.02 shall be
specifically enforceable. Any award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal shall
be in writing and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and may include
an award of costs, including reasonable legal fees and disbursements, to the
prevailing Party. The Parties undertake to carry out any award without delay
and waive their right to any form of recourse based on grounds other than
those contained in the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958 insofar as such waiver can
validly be made. Judgment upon any award may be entered by any court having
jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant Party or its
assets and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, the Parties agree that
any court of competent jurisdiction in which enforcement of the award is
sought shall have power to enforce the relief awarded by the Arbitral
Tribunal, regardless of whether such relief is characterized as legal,
equitable or otherwise.

 

(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring, or permit any of its Affiliates to
bring, any suit, action or other proceeding of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Lenders or any Affiliate thereof arising out of or relating to (x)
the Credit Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by the Credit
Agreement or the performance of services thereunder or (y) this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any forum other than any New
York State 

 



-13-  court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York
County, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the Parties
hereto agrees that the waiver of jury trial set forth in Section 6.02(l)
shall be applicable to any such suit, action or other proceeding. The Lenders
and their Affiliates are express third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.02(l).

 

(l) Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, New York for enforcing the
Parties agreement to arbitrate, enforcing any arbitration Award or obtaining
or enforcing interim measures (including injunctive relief). THE PARTIES
HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY IN ANY COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN ANY MATTERS ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION
INVOLVING THE LENDERS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. The Lenders and their Affiliates are express third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.02(l).

obligation of confidentiality to, AIG with respect to such information.

 

(c) If either AIG or AerCap is requested or required (by oral question,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) by any Governmental Authority or
pursuant to Applicable Law to disclose or provide any AerCap Confidential
Information or AIG Confidential Information (other than with respect to any
such information furnished pursuant to the financial reporting provisions of
this Agreement, which each Party shall be permitted to disclose in its public
filings as required by any Governmental Authority or pursuant to Applicable
Law and in accordance with past practice), as applicable, the Person
receiving such request or demand shall use all reasonable efforts to provide
the other Party with written notice of such request or demand as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances (except where such notice is prohibited
by Applicable Law) so that such other Party shall have an opportunity to seek
an appropriate protective order. The Party receiving such request or demand
agrees to take, and cause its Representatives to take, at the
requesting Partys expense, all other reasonable steps necessary to obtain
confidential treatment by the recipient. Subject to the foregoing, the Party
that received such request

required by such Law (as so advised by counsel) or by lawful process or such
Governmental Authority.

are informed as to the matters which are the subject of this Agreement, that
applicable securities Laws prohibit any Person who has received from an issuer
any material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of
such issuer or from communicating such information to any other Person
under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such Person is
likely to purchase or sell such securities.
