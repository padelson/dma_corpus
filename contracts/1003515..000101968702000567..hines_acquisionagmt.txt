the Vendor\'s Knowledge, the Business as  currently carried on by the Vendor
and its subsidiaries can,  after the Closing Date, be conducted substantially
in  accordance with the terms contemplated in the Transfer Pricing  Study
without any Material Adverse Effect on such Business  resulting from the
Business being conducted on such terms.   -22-      (d) To the extent
possible for a prospective analysis, the Vendor  has prepared contemporaneous
documentation described in  subsection 247(4) of the TAX ACT and in U.S.

occurred since the date of such letter than could reasonably  be expected to
affect the qualified status of such Company  Plan; (ii) each Company Plan has
been operated in all material  respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of  applicable law; and (iii) the Company and the subsidiaries 
have not incurred any direct or indirect liability under,  arising out of or

plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA that the Company, or  any other
entity that together with the Company is treated as  a single employer under
Section 414 of the Code, maintains or  ever has maintained or to which any of
them contributes, ever  has contributed, or ever has been required to
contribute),  and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists 
that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such  liability. The
aggregate accumulated benefit obligations of  each Company Plan of the
Company and its subsidiaries, as of  the Closing Date, do not exceed the fair
market value of the  assets of such plan.   (c) All Company Plans that are
subject to the laws of Canada are  in compliance in all material respects

any material product liability or material product warranty claims or
material product recalls. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.1.21, since
January 1, 1999, neither the Company nor any subsidiary has received any
written notice of a claim against the Company or any subsidiary, whether or
not fully covered by insurance, for product liability or liability on account
of any express or implied warranty, except for warranty obligations and
returns in the ordinary course substantially consistent with past practice
for which appropriate reserves have been reflected on the financial
statements included in the Prospectus. The reserves reflected in the
financial statements included in the Prospectus for product liability
and product warranty claims and for product recalls have been established in
good faith and in accordance with GAAP.  SECTION 4.1.22 Import/Export

or expense (whether or not involving a third-party claim) including
reasonable legal fees and expenses (collectively, "DAMAGES") suffered by,
imposed upon or asserted against a Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result

condition or covenant to be fulfilled or complied with by the  Vendor or
Hines under this Agreement; and   (b) subject to Sections 9.4 and 9.8, any
breach of any  representation or warranty given by the Vendor or Hines in 
this Agreement, provided that the Vendor and Hines shall not  be required to
indemnify or save harmless the Purchaser  Indemnified Parties unless the
Purchaser shall have provided  notice to the Vendor in accordance with
Section 9.5 on or  prior to the expiration of the survival time period
related to  such representation and warranty as set out in Section 9.4.  If
the Closing occurs, the remedies provided in this Section 9.1 and 9.8

(a) any failure of the Purchaser to perform or fulfil any  condition or
covenant to be fulfilled or complied with by the  Purchaser under this
Agreement; and   (b) subject to Section 9.4, any breach of any
representation or  warranty given by the Purchaser contained in this
Agreement,  provided that the Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify 
or save harmless the Vendor Indemnified Parties unless the  Vendor shall have
provided notice to the Purchaser in  accordance with Section 9.5 on or prior
to the expiration of  the survival time period related to such representation
and  warranty as set out in Section 9.4.  SECTION 9.4 TIME
LIMITATIONS.  (1) The representations and warranties of the Vendor and Hines
contained in  this Agreement shall survive the Closing and, notwithstanding
the  Closing and any investigation made by or on behalf of the Purchaser, 
shall continue for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the  Closing
Date except that:   (a) the representations and warranties set out in
Section 4.1.25  shall survive and continue in full force and effect for the 
benefit of the Purchaser for a period equal to the period for  which the
purchaser is liable for misrepresentations under the  Prospectus pursuant to
the SECURITIES ACT (B.C.);   (b) the representations and warranties set out
in Section 4.1.16  shall survive and continue in full force and effect until
30  days after the expiration of the period, if any, during which  an
assessment, reassessment or other form of recognized  document assessing
liability for Tax, interest or penalties  under applicable Tax legislation in
respect of any taxation  year to which such representations and warranties
extend could  be issued under such Tax legislation to the Purchased 
Companies but for any consent, waiver, agreement or other  document, made or
filed by the Purchased Companies after the  Closing; and   (c) the
representations and warranties set out in Section 4.1.17  shall survive and
continue in full force and effect with  respect to any claims arising in
connection with a taxable  year that commences on the Closing Date or within
three (3)  years after the Closing Date until thirty (30) days after 
expiration of any period during which an assessment,  reassessment or other
form of recognized document assessing  liability for Tax in respect of any
such taxation year could  be issued but for any consent, waiver, agreements
or other  document made or filed by the Purchased Company after the 
Closing;  and any claim in respect thereof (except a claim based on fraud)
shall be made in writing during such applicable time period and shall be
subject to Section 9.5.  (2) The representations and warranties of the
Purchaser contained in this  Agreement shall survive the Closing and,
notwithstanding such Closing  and any investigation made by or on behalf of
the Vendor, shall    -36-      continue in full force and effect for
the benefit of the Vendor for a  period of twenty-four (24) months from the
Closing Date and any claim  in respect thereof (except a claim based on
fraud) shall be made in  writing within such time period and shall be subject
to Section 9.5.  SECTION 9.5 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEEDINGS - THIRD PARTY
CLAIMS.  (1) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party (an "INDEMNIFIED
PARTY")  under Section 9.1, 9.2 or Section 9.3 of a notice of commencement
of  any proceeding against it by a third party, the Indemnified Party will, 
if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party (an  "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY") under such Section, give notice to the  Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such claim. The failure to  notify the Indemnifying Party
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party  of any liability that it may have to
any Indemnified Party, except to  the extent that the Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that the defence of  such action is prejudiced by the
Indemnified Party\'s failure to give  such notice.  (2) If any proceeding
referred to in Section 9.5(1) (a "PROCEEDING") is  brought against an
Indemnified Party and it gives notice to the  Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of the Proceeding, the  Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
participate in the Proceeding as  hereinafter provided. To the extent that
the Indemnifying Party wishes  to assume the defence of the Proceeding with
counsel satisfactory to  the Indemnified Party, it may do so provided it (i)
reimburses the  Indemnified Party for all of its out-of-pocket expenses
(including  solicitor\'s fees and disbursements) arising prior to or in
connection  with such assumption; and (ii) permits the Indemnified Party to 
participate in such defence through counsel chosen by the Indemnified  Party
provided that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be  borne by the
Indemnified Party unless there are separate defences  available to the
Indemnified Party or conflicts of interest in which  case those fees and
expenses will be paid by the Indemnifying Party.  After notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of  its election to assume the
defence of the Proceeding as against the  Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party will not, as long as it  diligently conducts such defence and except as
expressly provided  herein, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this
Section 9.5 for  any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect
to the  defence of the Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by
the  Indemnified Party in connection with the defence of the Proceeding, 
other than reasonable costs of investigation approved in advance by the 
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defence of a 
Proceeding as against the Indemnified Party (i) no compromise or  settlement
of such claims may be made by the Indemnifying Party without  the Indemnified
Party\'s consent unless (A) there is no admission of any  violation of Laws
or any violation of the rights of any Person and no  adverse effect on any
other claims that may be made against the  Indemnified Party, and (B) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages  that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party, and (ii) the  Indemnified Party will have no liability
with respect to any compromise  or settlement of such claims effected without
its consent. If notice is  given to an Indemnifying Party of the commencement
of any Proceeding  and the Indemnifying Party does not, within ten (10) days
after receipt  of such notice, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its
election to  assume the defence of the Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party
will be  bound by any determination made in the Proceeding or any compromise
or  settlement effected by the Indemnified Party acting in good faith.  
-37-     (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party
determines in  good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a
Proceeding may  adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result
of  monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification 
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the 
Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise,  or
settle the Proceeding. In such case, the Indemnifying Party will not  be
bound by any compromise or settlement effected without its consent  (which
may not be unreasonably withheld).  (4) Where the defence of a Proceeding is
being undertaken and controlled by  the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party will use its Best Efforts  to make available to the Indemnifying Party
those employees whose  assistance, testimony or presence is necessary to
assist the  Indemnifying Party in evaluating and defending any such claims. 
However, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the expense 
associated with any employees made available by the Indemnified Party  to the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.5(4), which  expense shall be
equal to the out of pocket expenses of such employees  and an amount to be
mutually agreed upon per person per hour or per day  for each day or portion
thereof that the employees are assisting the  Indemnifying Party and which
expenses shall not exceed the actual cost  to the Indemnified Party
associated with the employees.  (5) With respect to any Proceeding at the
request of the Indemnifying  Party, the Indemnified Party shall make
available to The Indemnifying  Party or its representatives on a timely basis
all documents, records  and other materials in the possession of the
Indemnified Party, at the  expense of the Indemnifying Party, reasonably
required by the  Indemnifying Party for its use in defending any such claim
and shall  otherwise cooperate on a timely basis with the Indemnifying Party
in  the defence of such claim.  (6) With respect to any Proceeding in
respect of income, corporate, sales,  excise, or other tax liability
enforceable by Lien against the property  of the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party\'s right to so defend  the Proceeding shall only apply
after payment of any such  re-assessment.  SECTION 9.6 OTHER
LIMITATIONS.  (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the
Purchaser  shall not be entitled to make any claim against the Vendor or
Hines, as  the case may be:   (a) in respect of any of the representations
or warranties in  respect of any claim that arises or is increased as a
result  of any increase in rates of taxation after the Closing or the 
passing of any enactment or other governmental regulation  (whether relating
to taxation or otherwise) or any judgment  delivered after the date hereof
with retrospective effect    -38-      unless a proposal to introduce
such increase in rates,  enactment or regulation was publicly announced on or
before  the Closing; provided, however, that in the case of any such 
increase, the claim shall apply to the extent thereof prior to  such
increase;   (b) to the extent the claim would not have arisen but for a
change  in accounting policies or practices introduced by the  Purchaser
after the Closing; and   (c) to the extent that the claim has been reduced
by the amount of  any recovery by the Purchaser under any insurance
policy.  (2) If any breach of the representations and warranties arises by
reason of  a liability of the Purchaser which is contingent when the claim
in  respect thereof is notified to the Vendor or Hines then the Vendor or 
Hines, as the case may be, will not be obliged to make any payment to  the
Purchaser until such time as the contingent liability ceases to be 
contingent and becomes an actual liability.  (3) Subject to limitations
found in Section 9.8, but notwithstanding any  other provision herein to the
contrary, the maximum aggregate liability  of the Vendor and Hines with
respect to any claims for indemnity  (including, for greater certainty, any
amounts claimed pursuant to  Sections 9.1, 9.2 and  9.8) other than amounts
claimed pursuant to section 10.4 under this  Agreement shall be the net
proceeds of the Offering; provided, that the  Vendor and Hines will only be
liable to the Purchaser in respect of  total claims in the aggregate
exceeding U.S.$1,000,000 and then only to  the extent of such excess over
U.S.$1,000,000.  (4) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
the maximum  aggregate liability of the Purchaser with respect to any claims
for  indemnity (including, for greater certainty, any amounts claimed 
pursuant to Section 9.3) shall be the net proceeds of the Offering; 
provided, that the Purchaser will only be liable to the Vendor in  respect of
total claims in the aggregate exceeding U.S.$1,000,000 and  then only to the
extent of such excess over U.S.$1,000,000.  (5) All claims for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9 shall be  expressed and all
payments made with respect to such claims shall be  paid in U.S. dollars. If
any currency conversion shall be required for  the purposes of expressing the
value of the claim or making any payment  pursuant to this Section 9, the
reference date for calculating the  applicable exchange rate shall be the
date on which the claim arose or  occurred.  SECTION 9.7 Amalco Entitled to
Indemnities.   Hines and the Vendor agree with the Purchaser and the Company
that effective on the Closing, Amalco shall be entitled to and be deemed to
have the full and direct benefit of each of the representations and
warranties of Hines and the Vendor given to the Purchaser in Article 4 and
the covenants contained herein as if such representations and warranties and
covenants were given to Amalco on Closing and as if the references to the
Company included Amalco. Hines and the Vendor furthermore agree with the
Purchaser and the Company that effective on the Closing, Amalco shall be
entitled to and be deemed to have the full and direct benefit of the
indemnification obligations of the Vendor and    -39-     Hines
contained in this Article 9. The Company agrees with the Vendor and
Hines that all of the terms and conditions of the indemnity obligations of
the Vendor and Hines\', including notice, that are applicable to the
Purchaser shall be equally applicable to Amalco. The Purchaser and Amalco may
in their sole discretion determine which of them seeks or obtains recovery or
remedy from the Vendor or Hines, as the case may be, in respect of a
particular fact, circumstance or event giving rise to such recovery or
remedy. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, neither the
Purchaser nor Amalco shall be entitled to recovery against the Vendor or
Hines under the provisions of this Article 9 if the other has recovered
against the Vendor or Hines under this Agreement in respect of any claim
arsing from the same facts or circumstances, the intention being that the
Vendor or Hines, as the case may be, shall only be required to make payment,
restitution or indemnification once to either the Purchaser or Amalco as the
case may be, as a result of any breach of any representation or warranty, or
covenant in relation to a particular fact, circumstance or event, regardless
of whether one or both of the Purchaser and Amalco have made a claim in
respect thereof.  SECTION 9.8 TAX INDEMNITY.   In addition to and without
limiting the generality of the above (but without duplication), Hines shall
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of and save them
harmless from:   (a) except to the extent indemnified pursuant to paragraphs
(b) or  (c), any Taxes, costs, expenses and liabilities including 
reasonable legal or accounting or economists\' fees which may  be suffered or
incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party  relating to any period ended on
or before the Closing Date or  to the portion of any taxation year or period
ending after the  Closing Date that ends on the Closing Date, except to the 
extent that such Taxes were specifically accrued as a  liability on the
financial statements in the Prospectus or  will be included as part of the
Net Working Capital  calculation;   (b) any Taxes, costs, expenses and
liabilities including  reasonable legal or accounting or economists\' fees
which may  be suffered or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party 
relating to any period ended on or before the Closing Date or  to the portion
of any taxation year or period ending after the  Closing Date that ends on
the Closing Date, that arise,  directly or indirectly, in any manner
whatsoever, as a  consequence of or in connection with any assessment or 
reassessment of, or proposal to assess or reassess, the  Company (a "Transfer
Pricing Assessment") under sections 247  or 245 (but only to the extent it
relates to transfer pricing  matters) of the Tax Act (the "Transfer Pricing
Rules"), and  any such Transfer Pricing Assessment that may occur further
to  a competent authority procedure under Articles IX or XXVI of  the
CANADA-UNITED STATES INCOME TAX CONVENTION (the  "Convention"), but only to
the extent such Taxes and other  amounts exceed any amount that is refunded
to the Vendor as a  result of or in connection with that Transfer Pricing 
Assessment in accordance with the INTERNAL REVENUE CODE  (United States of
America) or Articles IX or XXVI of the  Convention and paid by the Vendor to
the Company as required  by Section 10.6; and   -40-      (c) any
Taxes, costs, expenses and liabilities including  reasonable legal or
accounting or economists\' fees which may  be suffered or incurred by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party  relating to any taxation year that commences on
the Closing  Date or within three (3) years after the Closing Date as a 
result of, in respect of, connected with, or arising out of,  under or
pursuant to a breach of a representation and warranty  contained in Section
4.1.17.  The indemnity provided in this Section 9.8 shall survive (in the
case of paragraph (a)) until 30 days after the expiry of any period during
which any Purchaser Indemnified Party may be assessed or reassessed by any of
the CCRA or the Internal Revenue Service (United States of America) (the
"IRS") in connection with any issue to which the applicable indemnity
relates, and (in the case of paragraph (b)) in respect of any particular
taxation year of the Company until two years after receipt by the Company of
written notice from the CCRA of its intention to commence an audit relating
to that year to which the indemnity in paragraph (b) may apply and in the
case of paragraph (c) until 30 days after the expiry of any period during
which any Purchaser Indemnified Party may be assessed or reassessed by any of
the CCRA or the IRS in connection with any issue to which the applicable
indemnity relates in respect of any taxation year that commences on the
Closing Date or within three years after the Closing Date.  The obligation
of Hines under the indemnity in paragraph (b) shall not exceed US $3 million
in respect of the aggregate amount of all claims under that paragraph and the
indemnity in paragraph (c) shall not exceed U.S.$5million in respect of the
aggregate amount of all claims under that paragraph.  In the event that any
Purchaser Indemnified Party is assessed or reassessed for Taxes in respect of
which an indemnity under this Section 9.8 may be payable by Hines (a
"Reassessment"), the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall notify Hines
in writing of the Reassessment within 30 days of receipt thereof by the
Purchaser Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure by
the Purchaser Indemnified Party to so notify Hines within 30 days shall not
affect Hines\' obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Party under
this Section 9.8 except to the extent that such failure shall have materially
prejudiced the defence against the Reassessment. Hines shall:   (a) have
the right, at its option and expense, to participate in  and be present at
the defence against the Reassessment, which  shall mean the right to be
apprised of and be afforded the  opportunity to comment upon any submissions
but not to control  the defence, negotiation or settlement thereof, which
control  shall at all times rest entirely with the Purchaser  Indemnified
Party, and   (b) co-operate fully with the Purchaser Indemnified Party in 
connection with the defence, negotiation or settlement of the  Reassessment
(including any appeal or competent authority  procedure under Article IX or
XXVI of the CANADA-UNITED STATES  INCOME TAX CONVENTION), which co-operation
shall include the  provision to the Purchaser Indemnified Party of complete
and  timely access to all relevant books and records of any   
-41-      relevant Person Affiliated with Hines including any and all 
prior communications with the CCRA or the IRS on transfer  pricing or related
matters (the "Issues"), to all personnel  currently employed by or under
contract to any relevant Person  Affiliated with Hines having any knowledge
whatsoever of the  Issues and to all personnel previously employed by or
under  contract to any relevant Person Affiliated with Hines having  such
knowledge to the extent Hines or a relevant Person  Affiliated with Hines can
access such previously employed  personnel using reasonable best efforts.  
ARTICLE 10  POST-CLOSING COVENANTS  SECTION 10.1 ACCESS TO BOOKS AND
RECORDS.   For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date or for such
longer period as may be required by Law, the Purchaser and the Company shall
retain all original accounting Books and Records relating to the Business for
the period prior to the Closing Date. So long as such Books and Records are
retained by the Purchaser and/or the Company pursuant to this Agreement, the
Vendor shall have the right to inspect and make copies (at its own expense)
of them upon reasonable request during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice and without undue interference to the business operations
of the Purchaser and the Company. The Purchaser and the Company shall have
the right to have their representatives present during any such
inspection.  SECTION 10.2 INSURANCE PROCEEDS AND DISTRIBUTED CLAIMS.  
After the Closing, Purchaser agrees to, and agrees to cause the Purchased
Companies to:   (a) at the direction of the Vendor, use Best Efforts to
collect  the insurance proceeds and claims related to, and any other 
amounts available to the Purchased Companies with respect to,  the
Distributed Claims and the Special Receivables;   (b) cooperate with the
Vendor with respect to executing, or  causing the Purchased Companies to
execute, any documents  reasonably required to effectuate the assignment of
the  Distributed Claims; and   (c) provide the Vendor with access to the
books and records of the  Purchased Companies pertaining to the Distributed
Claims and  the Special Receivables. In the event that the Purchaser, 
Amalco or any of its subsidiaries receives any amounts related  to the
Distributed Claims, the Purchaser agrees to, and agrees  to cause the
Purchased Companies to, promptly deliver such  amounts to the
Vendor.  SECTION 10.3 SERVICE AGREEMENT.   During the twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, the Purchaser agrees to cause the Purchased
Companies, at no cost to the Vendor or Hines, to:   (a) provide services to
Hines and/or the Vendor, in a manner  consistent with the services provided
by the Company to Hines  and/or the Vendor on and prior to the Closing Date,
in  connection with the hosting and maintenance of Hines\' website  at
www.hines.horticulture.com and the NeoFlora horticulture  database used in
Hines\' business; and   -42-      (b) make such changes and additions
to such website and database  reasonably requested by Hines and/or the
Vendor.  SECTION 10.4 Reimbursement of Insurance Costs   During the period
from the Closing Date to December 31, 2002 (the "Coverage Period"), the
Purchaser agrees to cause Amalco to use its Best Efforts to maintain
insurance coverage commensurate (both in terms of types of coverage and
coverage limits) with the insurance coverage provided to the Company by Hines
prior to the Closing Date at a cost not to exceed the Company\'s
budgeted amount of U.S.$1,200,000 for such period. In the event that the
insurance coverage (as described above) obtained by the Company costs in
excess of its budgeted amount for the Coverage Period, Hines agrees to pay to
the Company, subject to a maximum payment by Hines of U.S.$500,000, the
lesser of:   (a) U.S.$20,480,000 less U.S.$300,000 minus the actual EBITDA
for  the Coverage Period, minus the total amount of the tax refund  received
by the Company in respect of the 2001 fiscal year;  and   (b) the
difference between U.S.$16,913,000 and the actual  distributable cash of the
Purchaser for the Coverage Period.  Such payment, if any, shall be provided
by Hines within 30 days of receiving documentary evidence of the results of
such formula.  SECTION 10.5 Hines Guarantee   Hines, an affiliate of the
Vendor, shall be responsible for and to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for
any failure by the Vendor to discharge its responsibilities and/or satisfy
its obligations to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, any indemnification claims pursuant to Section
9.  SECTION 10.6 TRANSFER PRICING.  In the event that the CCRA assesses,
reassesses or proposes to assess or reassess the Company (which for the
purposes of this Section 10.6 includes any successor thereto or assignee
thereof) under sections 247 or 245 (but only to the extent it relates to
transfer pricing matters) of the Tax Act (an "ASSESSMENT") in respect of any
taxation year which commenced prior to the acquisition of the Company by the
Purchaser then Hines and the Vendor shall cooperate, at the expense of Hines,
co-operate with the Company in seeking a resolution of the issues raised in
the Assessment with the competent authorities of Canada and the United States
of America in accordance with and to the greatest extent permitted by Article
IX of the CANADA -UNITED STATES INCOME TAX CONVENTION.  At the Closing,
Hines and the Vendor shall assign, free and clear of any Liens to the
Purchaser or a person designated by the Purchaser all amounts (up to
the maximum amount of the Assessment) to which Hines or any member of the

ENVIRONMENTAL    4.1.15(a) ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS   (A) PRIOR TO
REORGANIZATION   In August 2001, the Alberta Department of Human Resources
and  Employment notified the Company of an anonymous complaint  regarding
perlite dust at its Seba Beach (Alberta) plant. The  dust is created when
popped perlite is screened as it is  loaded into wagons and trailers. The
Company has taken  temporary and long-term measures to mitigate the dust
problem,  including rescheduling the loading of wagons and trailers  during
times when construction workers are not in the affected  area, and
constructing a building around the screening  equipment which will be
serviced by a cyclone and a bag house.  The remedial measures were outlined
in an August 21, 2001  letter to David Choong of the Alberta Department of
Human  Resources and Employment.   In May 1993, Pilko Associates completed
a Phase I  Environmental Assessment of facilities located in Seba Beach, 
Alberta, Elma and Jules, Manitoba, Terrell, Texas, Quincy,  Michigan,
Lameque, New Brunswick and Maisonnette, New  Brunswick. The Phase I
Assessment did not reveal any fines or  enforcement actions with respect to
any of the properties  included in the assessment. Nonetheless, Pilko
Associates  recommended certain remedial actions.   (B) AT CLOSING   In
addition to the environmental matters listed above, the  following could be
considered environmental matters of the  Company at Closing.   In August
2000, the Vendor was cited by the U.S. Department of  Labor Occupational
Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA")  for the following violations at
its Seneca, Illinois facility:  (i) exposing certain employees to dust from
furnaces and  bagging and sealing operations in violation of 29 CFR 
1910.13(a)(2); (ii) failing to ensure that bark/peat handler  had been fit
tested prior to use of respirator, in violation  of 29 CFR 1910.134(f)(2);
and (iii) exposing its raw ore  material handler to airborne concentrations
of particulates in  excess of 15 milligrams per cubic meter, in violation of
29  CFR 1910.1000(a)(2). The Vendor entered into an Informal  Settlement
Agreement with OSHA, pursuant to which it agreed to  take abatement measures
with respect to the foregoing  violations. The abatement measures are
outlined in an August  31, 2000 letter to OSHA. These abatement measures have
been  implemented.   -40-      The North Carolina Department of
Environment, Health and  Natural Resources Division of Solid Waste Management
has  determined that, in order to comply with the North Carolina  Solid
Waste Compost Rules (15A NCAC 13B.1401), a state  composting permit is
required at the Pro-Gro facility located  in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.
Under the terms of an Asset  Purchase Agreement dated as of August 23, 1999,
Henry Endres  (former owner of the Pro-Gro facility) became obligated to 
obtain a composting permit for the operation of the Pro-Gro  facility. On
August 31, 2001 the Vendor entered into a revised  agreement with Mr. Endres,
pursuant to which Mr. Endres  reaffirmed his obligation to obtain the permit,
to make any  improvements or repairs to the property necessary in 
connection with the issuance of the permit, to bear all costs  of such
repairs, and to pay all fees associated with obtaining  the permit. If Mr.
Endres fails to obtain the permit prior to  January 1, 2002, the Vendor shall
be entitled to obtain the  permit and recover the costs therefor from Mr.
Endres.   4.1.15(c) RELEASES TO THE ENVIRONMENT IN VIOLATION OF
