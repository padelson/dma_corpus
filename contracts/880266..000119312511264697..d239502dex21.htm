into and exchanged for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the
Closing Date Payment and (ii) at such later date in accordance with _Section
2.8_, the Post-Closing Payment, if any; and

(c) each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

SECTION 2.4. _Options; No Further Rights_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, and subject to the provisions of this _Article II_
, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any Option, each Option that
is vested (or becomes vested as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby), outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time (each, a " _Vested
Option_ ") shall, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the
holder of such Vested Option prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and
shall be automatically converted into and exchanged for the right to
receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, (i) an amount in cash (the " _Closing Date Option Payment_ "),
without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock that would be issued to the holder of such Vested
Option if such Vested Option were exercised, multiplied by (y) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Closing Date Payment over (B) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Option and (ii) at such later
date in accordance with _Section 2.8_, an amount in cash (the " _Post-Closing
Option Payment_ "), if any, without interest, equal to the product of (x)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be issued
to the holder of such Vested Option if such Vested Option were exercised,
multiplied by (y) the Post-Closing Payment. Payments of the Closing Date
Option Payment and Post-Closing Option Payment, if any, shall be made through
the CompanyÂ’s payroll process. Each Option that is outstanding and unexercised
but not a Vested Option after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration. For the
avoidance of doubt, each Option that vests solely based on continued
employment through a future date (as opposed to satisfaction of any
performance metrics) shall become a Vested Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



6 (b) In connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the board of
directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) has the authority under the
2007 GSI Holdings Corp. Stock Incentive Plan to terminate outstanding Options
and shall take action consistent with that authority to terminate outstanding
Options so that, as of the Effective Time, each Option that is outstanding
and unexercised at the Effective Time shall be canceled and, to the extent set
forth in this _Section 2.4_, converted into and exchanged for the right to
receive the payments described in this _Section 2.4_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to
any Vested Option is equal to or exceeds the sum of the Closing Date Payment
and the maximum possible amount of the Post-Closing Payment, such Vested
Option shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration; if the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to any Vested Option
exceeds the Closing Date Payment but is less than the sum of the Closing Date
Payment and the maximum possible amount of the Post-Closing Payment, such
Vested Option shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, if any,
the portion of the Post-Closing Option Payment that is equal to (i) the sum
of the Closing Date Payment and the Post-Closing Payment over (ii) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested
Option. Any payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ in respect of
any Vested Options shall be reduced by any income or employment tax
withholdings required under the Code, any applicable state, local, provincial
or foreign Tax laws or any other Applicable Laws.

 

(c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of shares
of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) and Options shall
cease to have any rights with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or
Options except for the right to receive the Closing Date Payment (and, if
applicable, the Post-Closing Payment) and/or the Closing Date Option
Payment (and, if applicable, the Post-Closing Option Payment) to which such
holder is entitled in accordance with _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.4_ hereof,
as applicable.

 

SECTION 2.5. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, any shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who timely delivers to the Company such holderÂ’s
notice of intent to demand payment for such holderÂ’s shares if the Merger is
effected, which holder shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and thereafter does not vote in favor of the
Merger or consent thereto in writing and who is entitled to, and shall have
demanded properly in writing, appraisal for such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "
and each holder of Dissenting Shares, a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall
not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Closing Date
Payment and the Post-Closing Payment, if any. Such Dissenting Stockholders
shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting
Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, except
that all Dissenting Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who have withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed
to have

 



7  been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Closing Date Payment and the Post-
Closing Payment, if any, in the manner provided in this _Article II_,
without interest. The Company shall have the right to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands in
excess of the amount of the Closing Date Payment and the Post-Closing Payment,
if any, in respect of any share of Company Common Stock without the prior
written consent of Parent, except to the extent that the CompanyÂ’s cash is
used prior to the Closing to effect such payment or settlement.

SECTION 2.6. _Paying Agent; Escrow Fund; Exchange Procedures_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Stockholder Representative, as the representative of
holders of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in
connection with _Section 2.3(c)_ hereof and Dissenting Shares) and Vested
Options (collectively, the " _Stockholders_ ") shall appoint a bank or trust
company (which bank or trust company will be reasonably acceptable to Parent)
to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and enter into a paying agent
agreement with such Paying Agent (which paying agent agreement will be in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) for the purpose of paying
the Estimated Merger Consideration and any Additional Merger Consideration. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Vested Options, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount in cash equal to (x) the Estimated Merger
Consideration _minus_ (y) the _Escrow_ Amount (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be used
solely for the purpose of paying (i) the Closing Date Payment to each holder
of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in connection with
_Section 2.3(c)_ hereof and Dissenting Shares) and (ii) the Closing Date
Option Payment to the Company for distribution to the holders of Vested
Options pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_. Nothing contained herein and no
investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall
diminish the rights of any Stockholder to receive the Closing Date Payment
and the Closing Date Option Payment as provided herein.

(b) _Escrow Fund_. Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Stockholder Representative, as the representative of the
Stockholders, shall appoint a bank or trust company (which bank or trust
company will be reasonably acceptable to Parent) to act as escrow agent (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ") and enter into an escrow agreement with the Escrow Agent,
the Company and Parent, such escrow agreement to be substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the
Escrow Agent, for the benefit of the Stockholders, an amount of cash equal to
the Escrow Amount (the portion of such deposit, together with any investment
income thereon, remaining in the Escrow Account at any time, the " _Escrow
Fund_ "). The Escrow Fund shall be governed by the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and this Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be held in escrow and
shall be released in accordance with _Section 2.8(g)_ hereof, _Section 8.9_
hereof and the Escrow Agreement.

 



8 (c) _Exchange Procedure_.

 

(i) The Company shall prepare and mail, or cause to be prepared and mailed, a
letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
E_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") to each Stockholder. At or prior to the
Closing, (A) each Stockholder may surrender to the Company (1) its
certificates and/or agreements representing the number of shares of Company
Common Stock held by such Stockholder (or an affidavit of lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate in the form attached to the Letter of Transmittal) or
(2) in the case of uncertificated shares, such shares ((1) and (2)
collectively, the " _Converted Shares_ "), in each case together with a duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and (B) if so surrendered, Paying Agent shall,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time or, if surrendered
after the Effective Time, the date of surrender, pay to such Stockholder the
amount of cash to which it is entitled under this _Article II_. In the event a
Stockholder does not deliver to the Company a Letter of Transmittal at
or prior to Closing, such failure shall not alter, limit or delay the Closing
or the conversion of such Company Common Stock as provided for in _Section
2.3_, but such Stockholder shall not be entitled to receive the payments
contemplated by this _Article II_ unless and until such Stockholder
surrenders the Converted Shares and a duly executed Letter of Transmittal to
the Company. After the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall act as agent for
payment of the Closing Date Payment upon surrender of the Converted Shares to
all Stockholders who have not so surrendered their Converted Shares on the
Closing Date.

(ii) Surrendered Converted Shares shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
surrendered and exchanged, each such Converted Share shall represent solely
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or
will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Converted Share.

SECTION 2.7. _Estimated Merger Consideration_.

(a) _Estimated Merger Consideration_. The aggregate consideration to be paid
by Parent at the Effective Time in respect of the Merger (the " _Estimated
Merger Consideration_ ") shall be an amount in cash equal to: (i) nine hundred
and forty million dollars ($940,000,000) (the " _Base Consideration_ "),
_plus_ (ii) the Estimated Cash _minus_ (iii) the Payoff Amount, _plus_ (iv)
the Estimated Net Working Capital Surplus, if any, or _minus_ (v) the
Estimated Net Working Capital Deficit, if any, _minus_ (vi) the Company
Transaction Expenses, _minus_ (vii) the aggregate amount of Transaction
Bonuses not paid prior to the Effective Time (the " _Transaction Bonus Amount_
") (each of (ii) through (vii) in the respective amounts set forth on the
Closing Date Statement), which sum shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to
_Section 2.8_ (as adjusted, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(b) _Closing Date Statement_. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare in good faith and deliver to
Parent a statement (the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") setting forth the (A)
Estimated Cash, (B) Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and (C) Estimated Net
Working Capital Surplus, if any, or Estimated Net Working Capital Deficit, if
any, each as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, prepared in
accordance with the Agreed Principles, together with reasonably detailed
supporting documentation. The Closing Date Statement shall also include the
Payoff Amount,

 



9  the Transaction Bonus Amount and the Company Transaction Expenses, each as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company and the Stockholder
Representative agree to provide Parent and its Representatives with
reasonable access to the Company, the Stockholder Representative and their
respective RepresentativesÂ’ working papers, as well as to any of the
personnel, property and facilities and such books and records and
other relevant information of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Stockholder Representative, reasonably related to the preparation of the
Closing Date Statement and the Dispute Notice, if any, throughout the period
of the adjustments under  _Section 2.8_ until the Conclusive Date.

SECTION 2.8. _Post Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Initial Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than forty-five (45) calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
prepare in good faith and deliver, or cause to be prepared in good faith and
delivered, to the Stockholder Representative a written statement (the "
_Initial Statement_ ") setting forth ParentÂ’s calculation of each of the
following items: (A) Cash, (B) Net Working Capital Amount and (C) Net Working
Capital Surplus, if any, or Net Working Capital Deficit, if any, each as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, prepared in accordance with the
Agreed Principles, together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation.
In the event that Parent does not deliver the Initial Statement within forty-
five (45) calendar days after the Closing Date, each item on the Closing
Date Statement shall be deemed undisputed and the Closing Date Statement
delivered by the Company shall become the Conclusive Statement and shall be
final and binding on Parent and the Stockholders as of such date for the
purposes of this Agreement. 

(b) _Accounting Principles_. The manner in which the Closing Date Statement
and the Initial Statement are to be prepared, and Cash, Net Working Capital
Amount, Net Working Capital Deficit and Net Working Capital Surplus are to be
calculated pursuant to this _Section 2.8_, is that they shall be prepared and
calculated using the same accounting principles, policies, methods,
practices, categories, estimates, judgments and assumptions as were used in
preparing the Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010
to the extent the same are in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent the
same are not in accordance with GAAP, then in accordance with GAAP, except as
set forth on _Schedule 2.8_ (the " _Agreed Principles_ ").

(c) _Review and Dispute of Initial Statement_. Parent agrees to provide, or
cause its employees (and the employees of the Company) to provide, the
Stockholder Representative and its Representatives with reasonable access to
ParentÂ’s and its RepresentativesÂ’ working papers and any working papers of
ParentÂ’s independent accountants related to the preparation of the Initial
Statement, as well as to any of the personnel, property and facilities and
such books and records and other relevant information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries throughout the periods during which the Initial Statement is
being prepared until the Conclusive Date, and Parent shall make
reasonably available its employees, if any, directly responsible for and
knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation of the
Initial Statement. The Stockholder Representative may dispute the Initial
Statement by delivery of written notice thereof (a " _Dispute Notice_ ")
within forty-five (45) calendar days following the receipt by the Stockholder
Representative of the Initial Statement. The Dispute Notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail all items disputed by the Stockholder Representative,

 



10  the basis for such dispute, the amounts involved and the Stockholder
RepresentativeÂ’s proposed changes thereto, with reasonably detailed supporting
documentation. If (i) by written notice to Parent, the Stockholder
Representative accepts the Initial Statement or (ii) the Stockholder
Representative fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within the prescribed forty-
five (45) calendar day period (which failure shall result in the Stockholder
Representative being deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Initial
Statement delivered by Parent), the Initial Statement delivered by Parent
shall become the Conclusive Statement and be final and binding on the
Stockholders as of the date on which the earlier of the foregoing events
occurs. If a Dispute Notice is timely delivered to Parent, then the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, during the thirty (30) calendar
days immediately following receipt of the Dispute Notice by Parent (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), cooperate and negotiate in good faith to resolve their
differences with respect to the Initial Statement or any element thereof. Any
resolution by the Stockholder Representative and Parent during the Resolution
Period as to any disputed amounts will be final, binding and conclusive. If
the Stockholder Representative and Parent resolve all disputed items on the
Initial Statement by the end of the Resolution Period, then such parties
shall revise the Initial Statement to reflect their agreement, which shall
then become the Conclusive Statement and be final and binding on the
Stockholders and Parent as of the date of such agreement.

 

(d) _Dispute Resolution_. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent do not
resolve all disputed items on the Initial Statement by the end of the
Resolution Period, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall submit all
items remaining in dispute with respect to the Dispute Notice (along with a
copy of the Initial Statement marked to indicate those line items which are
in dispute, including each PartyÂ’s proposed determination of such amounts and
reasonably detailed supporting documentation, as well as to reflect any
resolution of disputed items by such parties during the Resolution Period)
within thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration of the Resolution
Period to Deloitte LLP (or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act,
another internationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall
be agreed upon in writing by the Stockholder Representative and Parent, or,
if such parties cannot agree, as selected by the American Arbitration
Association) (the " _Neutral Auditor_ ") for resolution. The Neutral Auditor
shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator and shall determine only those
items in dispute. Each Party shall (i) cooperate with the Neutral Auditor,
(ii) have the opportunity to make presentations and provide supporting
material to the Neutral Auditor in defense of their positions and (iii)
subject to customary confidentiality and indemnity agreements, provide the
Neutral Auditor with access to their respective books, records, personnel and
Representatives and such other information as the Neutral Auditor may require
in order to render its determination. The Neutral Auditor will deliver to the
Stockholder Representative and Parent a written determination (such
determination to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations
used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information
provided to the Neutral Auditor by the Stockholder Representative and Parent)
of the disputed items within forty-five (45) calendar days of receipt of the
disputed items, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive on
the Stockholders and Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Neutral
Auditor shall only be permitted or authorized to determine an amount with
respect to any disputed item that is either the amount of such disputed item
as proposed by the Stockholder Representative in the Dispute Notice or the
amount of such disputed item as proposed by Parent on the Initial Statement.
All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Neutral Auditor will be allocated

 



11  between Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative (and
subsequently reimbursed pursuant to _Section 9.16(g)_), on the other hand, in
the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so
submitted to the Neutral Auditor that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such
party (as finally determined by the Neutral Auditor) bears to the total
disputed amount of such items so submitted. For the avoidance of doubt and
solely as an illustration of the methodology set forth in the preceding
sentence, if (i) the Dispute Notice delivered by the Stockholder
Representative assigns values to the disputed items such that the aggregate
Merger Consideration set forth in the Initial Statement would be increased by
one million dollars ($1,000,000), (ii) Parent maintains that the Merger
Consideration set forth in the Initial Statement is correct and (iii) the
Neutral AuditorÂ’s final resolution of the disputed items in accordance with
this _Section 2.8(d)_ is that the Merger Consideration is increased from the
amount set forth in the Initial Statement by $600,000 (i.e., sixty percent
(60%) of the amount in dispute is resolved in favor of the Stockholder
Representative), then the Stockholder Representative shall be responsible for
40% of such fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor and Parent shall be
responsible for 60% of such fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor. The
date on which the Stockholder Representative and Parent agree to or are deemed
in accordance with this _Section 2.8_ to have agreed to, or the Neutral
Auditor delivers, the Conclusive Statement shall be the " _Conclusive Date_."
In the event that either the Stockholder Representative or Parent fails to
submit a statement regarding any items remaining in dispute within the time
determined by the Neutral Auditor, then the Neutral Auditor shall render a
decision based solely on the evidence timely submitted to the Neutral Auditor
by the Stockholder Representative and Parent. The statement of Cash, Net
Working Capital Amount, Net Working Capital Deficit and Net Working Capital
Surplus which either is (i) undisputed, (ii) agreed upon or deemed to be
agreed upon by the Stockholder Representative and Parent in accordance with
_Section 2.8(c)_ or (iii) delivered by the Neutral Auditor in accordance with
this  _Section 2.8(d)_, will be the " _Conclusive Statement,_ "
respectively, and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Stockholders
and Parent.

(e) _Conclusive Merger Consideration_. The aggregate consideration to be paid
by Parent in respect of the Merger after taking into account all adjustments
pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ (the " _Conclusive Merger Consideration_ ")
shall be an amount in cash equal to: (i) the Base Consideration, _plus_ (ii)
the Conclusive Cash _minus_ (iii) the Payoff Amount, _plus_ (iv) the
Conclusive Net Working Capital Surplus, if any, or _minus_ (v) the Conclusive
Net Working Capital Deficit, if any, _minus_ (vi) the Company Transaction
Expenses, _minus_ (vii) the Transaction Bonus Amount, each as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the sake of clarity, the amounts
for the Base Consideration, the Payoff Amount and the Transaction Bonus Amount
are not subject to adjustment under this _Section 2.8_ and, for the purposes
of the definition of the Conclusive Merger Consideration in this paragraph
(e), shall be equal to the respective amounts set forth on the Closing Date
Statement.

(f) _Adjustment Amount_. The " _Adjustment Amount_ " shall be the difference,
if any, between the Conclusive Merger Consideration, on the one hand, and the
Estimated Merger Consideration, on the other hand; _provided_ that in no
event shall the Adjustment Amount be greater than the Escrow Amount. The
Adjustment Amount (if any) shall be (i) the " _Additional Merger
Consideration_ " if the Conclusive Merger Consideration is more than the
Estimated Merger Consideration or (ii) the " _Excess Amount_ " if the
Conclusive Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Merger
Consideration.

 



12 (g) _Post-Closing Payments_.

 

(i) If Additional Merger Consideration is determined to be due in accordance
with this _Section 2.8_, then, within five (5) Business Days after the
Conclusive Date, Parent shall deliver promptly by wire transfer to the Paying
Agent an amount in cash equal to the Additional Merger Consideration. The
Paying Agent shall promptly pay to each Stockholder its applicable Per Share
Portion of the amount referenced in this clause (i).

(ii) If there is an Excess Amount determined to be due in accordance with
this _Section 2.8_, then, within five (5) Business Days after the Conclusive
Date, the parties shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent to deliver promptly from the Escrow Account by wire transfer to Parent
an amount equal to the Excess Amount.

(iii) The Per Share Portion of the amounts, if any, payable to the
Stockholders pursuant to this _Section 2.8(g)_ shall herein be referred to as
the " _Post-Closing Payment_ ".

(h) All payments required to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ shall be
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to an
account or accounts designated in advance in writing by the party entitled to
receive such payment.

(i) The Stockholders and Parent agree to treat, and to cause their respective
Subsidiaries to treat, for all Tax purposes, any payment made under this
_Section 2.8_, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

 

(j) The Parties agree that (i) the Stockholder Representative and any of the
Stockholders and their Affiliates may engage Ernst and Young LLP and its
Affiliates to advise or represent them in connection with the determination of
any Adjustment Amount and the matters addressed by this _Section 2.8_ and
(ii) Parent and Merger Sub and their Affiliates may engage KPMG LLP and its
Affiliates to advise or represent them in connection with the determination of
any Adjustment Amount and the matters addressed by this _Section 2.8._ Each
party will enter into such waivers, indemnities and other agreements as Ernst
and Young LLP or KPMG LLP or each of their respective Affiliates, as the case
may be, shall reasonably require to permit Ernst and Young LLP, KPMG LLP and
each of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, to provide such
advice or representation.

SECTION 2.9. _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person
such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to
the appropriate Tax Authority by or on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such amounts
withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be.

 



13 SECTION 2.10. _Brazilian Debt_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall, to the extent a consent or waiver is required with respect to
any of the Brazilian Debt in connection with the consummation of the Merger,
either (a) procure the consent of the lenders under such applicable item of
Brazilian Debt or (b) cause the repayment in full of all principal, interest
and other amounts due or owing in respect of such Brazilian Debt at or prior
to the Closing. To the extent no such consent or waiver is required, the
Company shall have the option to leave such Brazilian Debt outstanding or to
repay such Brazilian Debt at or prior to the Closing.

own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is necessary because of the
property owned, leased or operated by it or because of the nature of its
business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be in good
standing or to have such requisite corporate or similar power and authority
or to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made
available to the Company complete and correct copies of the Organizational
Documents of Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as amended to the date of
this Agreement.

SECTION 5.2. _Authority; Approvals_. The execution, delivery and performance

issued by any court or other Governmental Entity.

SECTION 5.4. _No Violations_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) conflict with or
result in a breach of the Organizational Documents of Parent or Merger Sub,

of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under any of the provisions of
any contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, or by which any
such Person

 



32  or its properties or assets are bound, (iii) violate any Applicable Laws or
(iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than Permitted
Liens) upon any property or assets owned, used or held by Parent or Merger

Agreement or to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

any brokerÂ’s or finderÂ’s fee or any other commission or similar fee directly
or indirectly from any of the parties hereto in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 5.7. _Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub was formed specifically
for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has conducted no
operations and incurred no obligation other than those incident to its
formation and in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

SECTION 5.9. _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties in _Article IV_ , after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, the payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and

" _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, shall mean that, as of any
date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (A) the sum of the value
of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other
liabilities" as of such date, and the capital of such Person as computed in
accordance with Applicable Law as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with Applicable Laws governing

they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small

due. Parent is not entering into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES, CONTROLLING
PERSONS, AGENTS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OR ANY OTHER PERSON.

All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ shall be
directed to Goldman Sachs and Co. and CIBC World Markets Inc. All such

_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) Parent and Merger Sub (and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) agree to indemnify and hold the Company and its Subsidiaries
harmless from any and all claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses
for loss, injury to or death of any Representative of Parent or Merger Sub,
and any loss, damage to or destruction of any property owned by the Company

action or inaction of any of the Representatives of Parent or Merger Sub
during any visit to the business or property sites of the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, whether pursuant to this _Section
6.1_ or otherwise. During any visit to the business or property sites of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall
cause its respective Representatives accessing such properties to, comply with
all Applicable Laws and applicable Orders and all of the safety and security
procedures of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to conduct itself in a
manner that could not reasonably be expected to interfere with the operation,
maintenance or repair of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. None
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives shall conduct any
environmental testing or sampling on any of the business or property sites

respective best efforts to (i) prepare and file as promptly as practicable,
and in any event within the time prescribed by any Applicable Law or
Competition Law, all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports
and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,

practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) furnish as
promptly as practicable all information to any Governmental Entity as may be
required by such Governmental Entity in connection with the foregoing and

Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to
make any payment to any Person to secure such PersonÂ’s consent (other than
filing fees to be paid in connection with any filings as set forth in Section
6.2(b) below); _provided_ , _further_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
failure to obtain any of the consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations referenced above (other than any approvals, authorizations,
consents or waivers required pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ herein) shall
not be a condition to the obligation of either Party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company shall, and Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries not to, take or cause to be taken any action that
they are aware or should reasonably be aware would have the effect of

violation of _Section 4.6_.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,

Business prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall exercise, consistent with the other

their respective businesses.

 

SECTION 6.4. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. (a)
_Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted under
Applicable Law to, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect
of each of the foregoing) each present and former employee, agent, director
or officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, together with such
personÂ’s heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Person_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission by such Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an employee,
agent, director or officer occurring or alleged to have occurred whether
before or after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection
with such personÂ’s service as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any
entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be
required to indemnify any of the Indemnified Persons for any loss, expense, or
damage which such Person may suffer as a result of his, her or its intentional
misconduct, knowing violation of law or bad faith in failing to perform his,
her or its duties on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries. In the event
of any such Action, Parent shall cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the
defense of any such Action. 

(b) _Survival of Indemnification_. To the fullest extent not prohibited by
Applicable Law, from and after the Closing, all rights to indemnification now
existing in favor of the Indemnified Persons with respect to their activities
as such prior to, on or after the Closing Date, as provided in each of the
respective Organizational Documents or 

 



40  indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect on
the date of such activities or otherwise in effect on the date hereof, shall
survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of not less than six (6) years from the Closing Date; _provided_ that, in the
event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such survival period,
all such rights to indemnification in respect of any claim or claims shall
continue until final disposition of such claim or claims.

(c) _Insurance_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as of
the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay for, at no expense to the
beneficiaries and with the cost thereof to be shared equally by the
Stockholders and Parent (such that 50% of the cost of such insurance shall
increase the amount of Current Assets for purposes of calculating Net Working
Capital), non-cancellable "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of
at least six years from and after the Effective Time from insurance carriers
with the same or better claims-paying ability ratings as the CompanyÂ’s current
insurance carriers with respect to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "
_D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who are covered by the CompanyÂ’s existing
DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as the CompanyÂ’s existing DandO Insurance with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ that the Company shall not pay, or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall not be required to pay, for such "tail"
insurance policies a one-time net premium in excess of 200% of the CompanyÂ’s
current annual premium for DandO Insurance. If the Company and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at ParentÂ’s
expense and at no expense to the beneficiaries, DandO Insurance for a period of
at least six years from and after the Effective Time for the persons who
are covered by the CompanyÂ’s existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in such
existing DandO Insurance, from insurance carriers with the same or better
claims-paying ability ratings as the CompanyÂ’s current DandO Insurance
carriers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay for such DandO Insurance an annual premium in excess of 200% of
the CompanyÂ’s current annual premium for DandO Insurance (the " _Premium Cap_
"), but, to the extent such annual premium would exceed the Premium Cap, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at least six years from the
Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the CompanyÂ’s existing DandO
Insurance, DandO Insurance with the best overall terms, conditions, retentions
and levels of coverage reasonably available for an annual premium equal to the
Premium Cap.

(d) _Successors_. In the event that, after the Closing Date, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or a substantial portion of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.4_.

 



41 (e) _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 6.4_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or
her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her other Representatives.

SECTION 6.5. _Continuity of Employees and Employee Benefits; Bonus
Arrangements_. (a) The Surviving Corporation shall, for a period of one year
after the Closing, provide each employee of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries who was an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") with (x)
annual rates of base salary or hourly wages, as applicable, and target annual
incentive and bonus opportunities on terms that are no less favorable than the
annual rates of base salary or hourly wages, as applicable, and target annual
incentive and bonus opportunities provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing and (y) coverage and benefits on terms that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage and benefits provided
to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing. In addition, for
a period of one year after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall
provide to each Company Employee who remains in the employment of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries severance protections and benefits
that are no less favorable than the severance protections and benefits that
would have been applicable to such Company Employee under the applicable
severance policies of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date
of this Agreement (or, to the extent applicable to a particular employee,
such employeeÂ’s individual agreement), and/or the ParentÂ’s severance policies
applicable at such time to similarly situated employees of Parent, taking into
account in either case such Company EmployeeÂ’s additional period of service
and rate of base pay or wages and bonus target with the Surviving Corporation
after the Closing. Where applicable, each of the Company Employees shall
receive full credit for service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including predecessor companies) for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and, for purposes of severance and
vacation only, accrual under each employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement to be provided by the Surviving Corporation to such employee to
the same extent such service was recognized under the applicable Plan
immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) If the Effective Time occurs in 2011, then the following provisions shall
apply:

(i) immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the right to pay
each participant in the CompanyÂ’s annual bonus plans listed on _Schedule
4.14(b)_ as the Bonus Plans (the " _Bonus Plans_ "), who is employed at the
Effective Time a pro-rated annual bonus based on the number of elapsed days in
the 2011 calendar year prior to the Closing Date and assuming achievement by
the Company of the maximum annual EBITDA objective under such applicable
Bonus Plans (with no adjustment under the Bonus Plans for the "return on net
asset" calculation) (the aggregate amount of all such bonuses, whether or not
paid prior to the Closing, the " _Aggregate Pre-Closing Pro Rata Bonus
Amount_ ");

 



42 (ii) to the extent any portion of the Aggregate Pre-Closing Pro Rata
Bonus Amount is not paid to such participants prior to the Closing, the
amount not paid shall constitute a Current Liability for purposes of
calculating the Net Working Capital and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each participant his or her share of the amount not
paid in the first payroll cycle following the Closing;

(iii) following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay annual bonuses (less the amount paid under clause (i) and clause (ii)
above) when due (but no later than March 15, 2012) to each participant under
the applicable Bonus Plan based on the CompanyÂ’s actual annual EBITDA
(excluding any one-time expenses and charges associated with the transactions
contemplated hereby) for 2011 in accordance with the terms of the Bonus Plans
(as in effect on the date hereof, without amendment or modification including
with any adjustment under the Bonus Plans for the "return on net asset"
calculation) (the aggregate amount of all such bonuses paid under this clause
(iii), the " _Aggregate Post-Closing Pro Rata Bonus Amount_ " and, together
with the Aggregate Pre-Closing Pro Rata Bonus Amount, the " _Aggregate Bonus
Amount_ "); provided that any participant whose employment is terminated by
the Surviving Corporation without "cause" on or after the Closing Date and
prior to the applicable payment date shall be deemed to be employed through
such payment date; and

 

(iv) to the extent that the Aggregate Pre-Closing Pro Rata Bonus Amount
exceeded the SellersÂ’ Share of the Bonus Amount, then such excess shall
increase the amount of Current Assets for purposes of calculating Net Working
Capital on the Conclusive Statement and, conversely, to the extent that the
SellersÂ’ Share of the Bonus Amount exceeded the Aggregate Pre-Closing Pro
Rata Bonus Amount, then such excess shall increase the amount of the Current
Liabilities for purposes of calculating Net Working Capital on the Conclusive
Statement (for purpose of the foregoing, the "SellersÂ’ Share of the Bonus
Amount" shall mean the product of the Aggregate Bonus Amount multiplied by a
fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the number of elapsed days in the 2011
calendar year prior to the Closing Date and (y) the denominator of which is
365).

(c) If, on the other hand, the Effective Time occurs in 2012, then following
provisions shall apply: 

(i) immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the right to pay
each participant in the Bonus Plans who is employed at the Effective Time an
annual bonus in respect of the 2011 calendar year assuming achievement by the
Company of the maximum annual EBITDA objective under such applicable Bonus
Plans with the applicable adjustment for the "return on net asset"
calculation (the aggregate amount of all such bonuses, whether or not paid
prior to the Closing, the " _Aggregate Full-Year Bonus Amount_ "); and

 



43 (ii) to the extent any portion of the Aggregate Full-Year Bonus Amount is not
paid to such participants prior to the Closing, the amount not paid shall
constitute a Current Liability for purposes of calculating the Net Working
Capital and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each
participant his or her share of the Aggregate Full-Year Bonus Amount in the
first payroll cycle following the Closing.

(d) The Company shall have the right to pay one-time bonuses to employees in
connection with the Closing (the " _Transaction Bonuses_ "). For the avoidance
of doubt, Parent agrees that the transactions contemplated hereby constitute
a "change of control" or "change in control" under each Plan which uses any
such term.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ are intended to be solely for the
benefit of, and shall be solely enforceable by, the parties hereto; no
individual employee shall have any third-party beneficiary right under this
Section 6.5. 

SECTION 6.6. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press release
approved in advance by the Parties hereto, and thereafter until the Closing,
(i) any press or similar public announcement or communication in respect of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be provided to
the other Party in advance of release for such other PartyÂ’s review and
comment and the releasing Party will in good faith consider all reasonable
comments and (ii) except as the Company or Parent may determine in good faith
is required to be issued or made to comply with the requirements of any
Applicable Law, the rules of any national securities exchange, Competition Law
or any applicable Order, no press release or similar public announcement
or communication shall (whether prior or subsequent to the Closing) be made
or caused to be made in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
in which case the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other reasonable time to comment
on such press release or other public announcement or communication in
advance of such issuance or making; _provided_ that the Parties and their
Affiliates may make internal announcements regarding this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to their respective directors, officers
and employees without the consent of the other Parties.

SECTION 6.7. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, Parent shall pay all Parent Transaction Expenses and the Company
shall, except as set forth in _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_, pay all
Company Transaction Expenses.

SECTION 6.8. _Tax Matters_. (a) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be shared equally by the Company, as a Company Transaction
Expense, and Parent.

(b) _Tax Agreements_. As of the Closing, the Company shall, or shall cause its
relevant Subsidiaries to, as the case may be, terminate any Tax sharing,
allocation or indemnification agreement or similar contract or arrangement or
any agreement (to which it is a party, is bound by or has any obligation
under) that obligates it to make any payment computed by reference to the
Taxes, taxable income or taxable losses of any other Person. 

 



44 (c) _Straddle Period Allocation_. In the case of a Straddle Period,
the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date shall be deemed to be: (1) in the case of Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes), the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days from the beginning of such Straddle Period to and including the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such full
Straddle Period, and (2) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (1)
above (such as Taxes that in whole or in part are based on, measured by or
calculated with reference to sales, net income, profits or gains (including
any state or local franchise Taxes)), the amount of such Taxes shall be
determined as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date.

(d) _Tax Filings_.

 

(i) For any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
the Stockholder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed, in a manner consistent with Applicable Law and, to the
extent possible, consistent with past practices of the Company, with the
appropriate Tax Authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed; provided,
however, that no such Tax Return shall be filed without the prior written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In
connection with the filing of such Tax Returns, Parent agrees that the
Transaction Tax Deductions may be claimed in such Tax Returns prepared by the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1)
(and not pursuant to the "next day rule" of Treas. Reg.
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)). The Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s rights under this
paragraph 6.8(d)(i) shall include the right to make all necessary applications
or filings for the refund of estimated Tax payments made by the Company for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ that no such application or filing for
the refund shall be made without the prior written consent of Parent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Furthermore, if the Company has a net
operating loss for the final Pre-Closing Tax Period subject to this paragraph
6.8(d)(i), the Stockholder Representative shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or the Company to file an Internal Revenue Service Form 1139
(Corporation Application for Tentative Refund) for each of the two immediately
preceding Tax years of the Company; _provided_ that no such Internal Revenue
Service Form shall be filed without the prior written consent of Parent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Any refunds of estimated Taxes or
other Taxes received as a result of the provisions of this _Section
6.8(d)(i)_ shall be paid in accordance with _Section 6.8(e)(i)_.

(ii) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to file all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by or with respect to the Surviving Corporation and
any of its Subsidiaries for taxable years or periods ending after the Closing
Date and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.

 



45 (iii) For any Straddle Period of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared, and file
or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed and shall pay all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. Parent shall seek reimbursement of
such portion of such Taxes allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (determined
in accordance with Section 6.8(c)) under Section 8.2. Parent shall permit the
Stockholder Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return
described in the preceding sentence prior to the filing thereof.

(iv) To the extent Parent amends, or causes the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries to amend, any Tax Return that pertains to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, any breach of a representation or warranty contained in Section 4.13
of this Agreement that results solely from the amendments so made or caused to
be made by Parent shall not give rise to a claim for indemnification against
the Stockholders under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_.

(e) _Refunds_.

(i) The amount or economic benefit of any refunds of Taxes of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries relating to a Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the Closing
Date, or to any Tax Return on which the Stockholder Representative (for the
benefit of the Stockholders) has claimed a Transaction Tax Deduction for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to _Section 6.8(d)(i)_ (but, in such case,
only to the extent such refunds solely relate to such claimed Transaction
Tax Deductions), shall be for the account of the Stockholder Representative
(for the benefit of the Stockholders); provided that the amount or economic
benefit of any such refunds shall be for the account of Parent to the extent
such refunds are for non-income Taxes and have already been included as an
asset in the determination of the Net Working Capital Amount as shown on the
Conclusive Statement; provided further that Parent shall pay, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay, to the Stockholder Representative (for the
benefit of the Stockholders), within five (5) Business Days of the receipt
thereof, any such refunds that are for the account of the Stockholder
Representative. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds of Taxes of the
Company (including as the Surviving Corporation) or any of its Subsidiaries
for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the
account of the Parent Indemnitees. The amount or economic benefit of any
refunds of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Straddle
Period (other than any included in the preceding sentences of this clause (e))
shall be apportioned between Parent (on behalf of the Parent Indemnitees) and
the Stockholder Representative (for the benefit of the Stockholders) in a
manner consistent with the allocation provisions of _Section 6.8(c)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, an amount or economic benefit attributable to any refunds
of Taxes, other than refunds of estimated Taxes or other Taxes received
solely as a result of the

 



46  provisions of _Section 6.8(d)(i)_, resulting from the Parent filing an
amended Tax Return after the Closing Date relating to a taxable year of the
Parent ending before the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Parent,
notwithstanding that the items reflected on such amended Tax Return giving
rise to such refund or economic benefit may not be attributable to the Parent
prior to the Closing Date.

 

(ii) To the extent that there are Transaction Tax Deductions that remain
available to be carried forward to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to carry forward any net operating losses
attributable to the Transaction Tax Deductions to future Tax periods, subject
to applicable requirements and limitations of Tax law. Parent shall pay, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, an amount to the Stockholder
Representative (for the benefit of the Stockholders) equal to the reduction in
the Surviving CorporationÂ’s (and its AffiliatesÂ’) Tax liability in any such
Tax period attributable to the carry forward of any net operating loss
attributable to any Transaction Tax Deduction, provided that for purposes of
computing the amounts payable under this _Section 6.8(e)(ii)_, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates shall be deemed to use all other
deductions, amortizations, exclusions from income or other Tax allowances of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates (to the extent such
deductions, amortizations, exclusions from income or other Tax allowances are
entitled to be used under applicable Tax law) prior to the use of any
Transaction Tax Deductions or net operating loss carryforwards attributable to
the Transaction Tax Deductions (i.e., any reduction in Tax liability
attributable to any Transaction Tax Deductions shall be determined on a with
and without basis, based on the Surviving CorporationÂ’s effective tax rate for
such Tax period). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
6.8(e)(ii)_, Parent (or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable) shall only
be obligated to make a payment pursuant to this _Section 6.8(e)(ii)_ for any
reduction in the Surviving CorporationÂ’s (and its AffiliatesÂ’) Tax liability
for a taxable year ending on or before December 31, 2016. Any payment to the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 6.8(e)(ii)_ shall be
paid by Parent (or Surviving Corporation at the direction to Parent) and
delivered, together with a schedule detailing the calculation of the reduction
in Tax liability, within ten (10) Business Days of the filing date of the Tax
Return (including any estimated Tax Return) reflecting the reduction of the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s Tax liability.

(f) _Tax Claims_. If a claim is made by any Tax Authority, which, if
successful, might result in an indemnity payment to an indemnified party under
Section 8.2, then such indemnified party shall give notice to the indemnifying
party in writing of such claim (a " _Tax Claim_ ") and any proposed
counterclaim; _provided_ , that the failure to give notice shall not affect
the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying
party was materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. With respect to
any Tax Claim asserted against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the Stockholder Representative might
have an indemnity obligation under _Section 8.2_, the Stockholder
Representative shall, at its own cost and expense, have the right (but not the
obligation) to control all such proceedings and make all decisions taken in
connection with such

 



47  Tax Claim and may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals,
proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Tax Authorities with respect
thereto and either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the
Tax Claim in any permissible manner; _provided_ , however that the Stockholder
Representative must first consult in good faith with (and provide any
additional relevant information to) Parent before taking any action with
respect to the conduct of such Tax Claim and shall not settle, compromise or
abandon such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld). Parent shall have the right to
participate fully and in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such
Tax Claim, with counsel of its own choosing. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent shall control all other proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim;
provided that, if such Tax Claim relates to a Straddle Period and the
Stockholder Representative could have, in the reasonable good faith
determination of Parent, an indemnity obligation under _Section 8.2_, Parent
must first consult in good faith with (and provide any additional relevant
information to) the Stockholder Representative before taking any action with
respect to the conduct of such Tax Claim and shall not settle, compromise or
abandon such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

(g) _Cooperation_. The Stockholder Representative, Company, each of its
Subsidiaries and Parent shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other
representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable
periods relating to Taxes, including by maintaining and making available to
each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or
explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings
relating to Tax Claims.

SECTION 6.9. _Retention of Books and Records_. Parent shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to retain all Books and Records maintained since January
1, 2005 and in existence at the Effective Time that are required to be
retained under current retention policies for a period of seven (7) years from
the Closing Date, and to make the same available after the Effective Time for
inspection and copying by the Stockholder Representative or its
Representatives at the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s expense, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable request and upon reasonable advance notice.

 

SECTION 6.10. _Competing Transactions_. Parent agrees that it shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, acquire or
agree to acquire, or be acquired or agree to be acquired by, whether by
merger, consolidation, purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or
equity in or by any other manner, any assets, business or any Person, if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of
such acquisition, merger, consolidation or purchase could reasonably be
expected to (a) impose any delay on the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period or impose any delay on the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any license, permit, franchise,
certificate, approval, consent, registration, variance, exemption or other
authorization issued by or obtained from a Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
Consents and Approvals, (b) increase the risk of any Governmental Entity
entering a Prohibitive Order, (c) increase the risk of not being able to
remove any such Prohibitive Order on appeal or otherwise or (d) delay or
impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



48 SECTION 6.11. _Further Assurances_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree
that, from time to time before and after the Effective Time, they will (i)
use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to cause the conditions
to the other PartyÂ’s obligation to close the transactions contemplated herein
as set forth in _Article III_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) execute
and deliver, or use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Subsidiaries to execute and deliver, such further instruments, and take, or
cause their respective Subsidiaries to take, such other action as may be
reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement.
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries agree to use
their best efforts to refrain from taking any action which could reasonably be
expected to materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

Date (the Initial Termination Date, to the extent it is extended pursuant to
this _Section 7.1(b)_, is referred to herein as the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach of
any covenant or agreement under this Agreement shall have been a material
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
such date;

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if any Prohibitive Order permanently
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall have become final and non-appealable;  _provided_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not
be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been a material cause of, or resulted in, the occurrence
of such Prohibitive Order;

 



49 (d) by Parent, by written notice to the Company and the
Stockholder Representative, if the Company has breached or failed to perform
any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement or if any

time of such breach or failure or as of the time such representation or
warranty was or shall have become inaccurate, and (ii) such breach or failure

within such thirty-day period;  _provided_ that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if it is
then in breach of any of its covenants set forth in this Agreement that would
result in the closing conditions set forth in _Section 3.1_ or _Section
3.3_ (other than those conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied
until the Closing) not being satisfied;

 

(e) by the Company, by written notice to Parent, if Parent has breached or
failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement or if any representation or warranty of Parent contained in this
Agreement shall be or shall have become inaccurate, in either case (i) such

and requesting that it be cured, or the Company and the Stockholder
Representative shall not have received adequate assurance of a cure of such
breach within such thirty-day period; _provided_ that the Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_
if it is then in breach of any of its covenants set forth in this Agreement
that would result in the closing conditions set forth in _Section 3.1_ or
_Section 3.2_ (other than those conditions which by their terms cannot be
satisfied until the Closing) not being satisfied; or

(f) by the Company on or after November 14, 2011, if all of the conditions
set forth in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_ have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied other than at
the Closing and those conditions that are not satisfied as a result of
ParentÂ’s or Merger SubÂ’s breach of this Agreement) and Parent and Merger Sub
fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date
the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

SECTION 7.2. _Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall thereafter
become void and have no further force and effect, and no Party (nor any of its

signatory thereto) shall comply with all of its obligations under the

ARTICLE VIII

_INDEMNIFICATION_

SECTION 8.1. _Survival_. Each of the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in _Article IV_ and of Parent and Merger Sub contained in
_Article V_ shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the

the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.1_, _Section
4.2_, _Section 4.3_, _Section 4.16_, _Section 5.1_,  _Section 5.2_ and
_Section 5.6_ shall survive the Closing and shall have no expiration date.
The covenants and agreements contained herein requiring performance in their
entirety on or prior to the Closing shall terminate at the Closing. The
covenants and agreements contained herein requiring performance after the
Closing Date shall survive in accordance with their terms. If any Claims
Notice (as defined below) is given in good faith in accordance with the terms
of  _Section 8.4_ on or prior to the applicable survival date, the claims
specifically set forth in the Claims Notice shall survive until such time as
such claim is finally resolved.

 

SECTION 8.2. _Indemnification by the Stockholders; Indemnification by
Parent_. (a) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, from and after the
Closing Date, the Stockholders, but solely from the funds held in the Escrow

Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), and each of
their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, shareholders,
partners, members and Representatives (each, a " _Parent Indemnitee_ "), from

51  connection with (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the
representations or warranties made by the Company in Article IV or in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(c), (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement made hereunder by the Company or the Stockholder
Representative and (iii) the exercise by any holder of its statutory appraisal
rights referred to in _Section 2.5_. From and after the Closing, no claim
may be asserted nor any action commenced against the Stockholders under
_Article VIII_ unless a Claims Notice has been delivered to the Stockholder
Representative by Parent (on behalf of Parent Indemnitees) on or prior to
the date on which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
which such claim or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in _Section
8.1_.

 

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, from and after the Closing
Date, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the

the Company and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees and
Representatives (each, a " _Stockholder Indemnitee_ ," and together with the
Parent Indemnitees, the " _Indemnitees_ " and each an " _Indemnitee_ "), from
and against any and all Losses arising from, out of or in connection with (i)
any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties made
by Parent and the Merger Sub in _Article V_ or in the certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
made hereunder by Parent or the Merger Sub, and after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Closing, no claim may be asserted nor any action commenced

delivered to Parent by the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of
Stockholder Indemnitees) on or prior to the date on which the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim or action is based ceases
to survive as set forth in _Section 8.1_.

 

SECTION 8.3. _Limitations on Indemnification_. (a) Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the cumulative
indemnification obligations of the Stockholders under _Section 8.2(a)_, on
the one hand, or Parent under _Section 8.2(b)_, on the other hand, in the
aggregate exceed an amount equal to the Escrow Amount. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Stockholders shall not be liable to the Parent Indemnitees for
indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ to the extent such Losses were
included in the determination of the amounts reflected on the Conclusive
Statement (it being understood that the Stockholders shall not be
liable pursuant to this _Article VIII_ to the extent an item was
substantially resolved by the Independent Accountant in connection with the
determination of the Conclusive Statement).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Stockholders shall not be liable to the Parent Indemnitees for
indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ (other than with respect to a claim
for indemnification based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason
of (1) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in
_Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.3_, _Section 4.13_, and _Section
4.16_ or (2) the exercise by any holder of its statutory appraisal rights
referred to in  _Section 2.5_ (collectively, the " _Parent Basket
Exclusions_ "), until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification

 



52  under _Section 8.2(a)_ (other than those based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of the Parent Basket Exclusions) exceeds five million
dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Basket Amount_ "), whereupon the Parent
Indemnitees shall be entitled to receive only amounts for Losses in excess of
the Basket Amount, in which case, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification for the amount of such Losses up to the amounts then
available in the Escrow Account. No individual claim (or series of related
claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) by a
Parent Indemnitee may be asserted (and no Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled
to indemnification with respect to any such claim or series of related claims
arising from the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) with respect
to _Section 8.2(a)_ (other than with respect to a claim for indemnification
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of the exercise by
any holder of its statutory appraisal rights referred to in _Section 2.5_)
unless the aggregate amount of Losses that would be payable with respect to
such claim (or series of related claims arising from the same underlying
facts, events or circumstances) exceeds an amount equal to $100,000, and any
such individual claim (or series of related claims arising from the same
underlying facts, events or circumstances) for amounts less than $100,000
shall not be applied to or considered for purposes of determining whether the
Basket Amount has been reached.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall be liable to the Stockholders for indemnification under
_Section 8.2(b)_ (other than with respect to a claim for indemnification
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty in  _Section 5.1_, _Section
5.2_, _Section 5.4_, _Section 5.5_ and _Section 5.6_ (collectively, the "
_Stockholder Basket Exclusions_ "), until the aggregate amount of all Losses
in respect of indemnification under _Section 8.2(b)_ (other than those based
upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of the Stockholder Basket
Exclusions) exceeds the Basket Amount, whereupon the Stockholder Indemnitees
shall be entitled to receive only amounts for Losses in excess of the Basket
Amount, in which case, the Stockholder Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification for the amount of such Losses up to the amounts then available
in the Escrow Account. No individual claim (or series of related claims
arising from the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) by a
Stockholder Indemnitee may be asserted (and no Stockholder Indmenitee shall be
entitled to indemnification with respect to any such claim or series of
related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or
circumstances) with respect to _Section 8.2(b)_ unless the aggregate amount
of Losses that would be payable with respect to such claim (or series of
related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or
circumstances) exceeds an amount equal to $100,000, and any such individual
claim (or series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts,
events or circumstances) for amounts less than $100,000 shall not be applied
to or considered for purposes of determining whether the Basket Amount has
been reached.

(e) Solely for purposes of this _Article VIII_ , any inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "Company Material Adverse
Effect," "Parent Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set
forth therein; _provided_ , _however_ , any such qualification or limitation
shall not be disregarded for purposes of _Section 4.6(i)_ or to the extent
that it modifies the identification of applicable lists of agreements,
contracts, instruments, insurance policies, environmental reports,
Environmental Permits, Plans or Permits.

 



53 (f) In addition to and without in any way limiting any other provisions
or limitations of this Agreement that may apply, with respect to any claim
asserted by any Parent Indemnitee for any Losses arising out of or related to
any breach of any representations and warranties in _Section 4.9_
(Environmental Matters), neither the Stockholder Representative nor any
Stockholders shall have any obligation to any Parent Indemnitee to the extent
that such Losses arise out of:

 

(i) any act or omission by or on behalf of any Parent Indemnitee that results
in a Release of any Hazardous Substances, or that disturbs or exacerbates the
condition of any Hazardous Substances, but such acts shall not include any
sampling undertaken pursuant to subparagraph (iii)(A) or (iii)(B) hereof,
provided that such sampling and any related activities are performed with due
care; or,

(ii) any lawsuit or administrative enforcement action brought or threatened to
be brought by or before, any formal or informal directive or order issued by,
or any investigation or remediation undertaken by, any Governmental Entity as
a result of any soliciting or importuning by or on behalf of any Parent
Indemnitee relating to the subject of such lawsuit, enforcement action,
directive, order, investigation or remediation; or

(iii) any sampling of soil, groundwater or other environmental media by or on
behalf of or allowed by or on behalf of any Parent Indemnitee, unless (A)
required by Environmental Law, or (B) required with respect to any improvement
or construction to be undertaken by any Parent Indemnitee, or required to
continue the existing uses of the Owned Real Property or Leased Facilities, or
required to respond to claims by any Governmental Entity or third party that
Hazardous Substances are migrating onto or have migrated onto property beyond
the boundaries of the Owned Real Property or Leased Facilities, provided that
reasonably in advance of any such sampling the relevant Parent Indemnitee
shall notify in writing and consult with the Stockholder Representative
regarding such plans and shall obtain the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s
approval thereof, which the Stockholder Representative shall not unreasonably
withhold; or

 

(iv) any change in the use of any Owned Real Property or Leased Facilities
from its current use to a new or different use that no longer involves
manufacturing, warehousing, or other current use of such Owned Real Property
or Leased Facilities.

 

SECTION 8.4. _Indemnification Claim Process_. (a) All claims for
indemnification by either a Stockholder Indemnitee or Parent Indemnitee under
this _Article VIII_ shall be asserted and resolved in accordance with
_Sections 8.4_, _8.5_ and _8.9_.

(b) If a Parent Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification for a Third Party
Claim pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , the Parent Indemnitee shall promptly,
but in no event more than thirty (30) calendar days following such Parent
IndemniteeÂ’s knowledge of such claim, notify the Stockholder Representative in
writing of such claim, describing such claim in reasonable detail and the
amount or estimated amount of such Losses (the " _Claims Notice_ ").

 



54  The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve
the Stockholders of their indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Stockholders forfeit rights or defenses or are otherwise
actually prejudiced by reason of such failure.

(c) All Stockholder Indemnitees, acting through the Stockholder
Representative, that intend to seek indemnification for a Third Party Claim
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , shall promptly, but in no event more than
thirty (30) calendar days following the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s
knowledge of such claim, deliver a Claims Notice to Parent. The failure to
give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve Parent of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that Parent
forfeits rights or defenses or are otherwise actually prejudiced by reason of
such failure.

(d) The Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days from the date on which the
Indemnitor received the Claims Notice to notify the Indemnitee that the
Indemnitor desires to assume the defense or prosecution of the Third Party
Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the
Indemnitor assuming such defense it shall first verify in writing that such
Indemnitor shall be fully responsible for all Losses relating to such Third
Party Claim and that it will provide full indemnification (subject to the
applicable limits, if any, set forth in this _Article VIII_ ) to the
Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume such defense if (i) such
Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
allegation, (ii) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against an Indemnitee, (iii) an adverse determination with
respect to such Third Party Claim would be materially detrimental to or
materially injure the IndemniteeÂ’s reputation or future business prospects, or
(iv) the Indemnitee reasonably believes that the Losses relating to such
Third Party Claim could exceed the maximum amount that such Indemnitee could
then be entitled to recover under this _Article VIII_. If the Indemnitor
assumes the defense of such claim in accordance herewith: (x) the Indemnitee
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim (upon reasonable prior written notice to
the Indemnitor), but the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense
and settlement thereof, and such co-counsel shall reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnitor and its counsel; (y) the Indemnitee shall not file any papers
or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor; and (z) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or settlement provides
solely for the payment of money, the Indemnitor makes such payment in full and
the Indemnitee receives an unconditional release. The parties shall act in
good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing
with Third Party Claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give each other
reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. Whether or not the
Indemnitor has assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor
will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder with respect to
any settlement entered into or any judgment consented to without the
IndemnitorÂ’s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).

 



55 (e) If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Claims Notice, the Indemnitee
will be entitled to assume such defense, at its sole cost and expense (or, if
the Indemnitee incurs a Loss with respect to the matter in question for which
the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_
, at the expense of the Indemnitor), upon delivery of notice to such effect to
the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor (i) shall have
the right to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim at its sole
cost and expense, (ii) may at any time thereafter assume defense of the Third
Party Claim, in which event the Indemnitor shall bear the reasonable fees,

the facts and circumstances related to such Loss and the nature of the

except to the extent of any Losses arising out of fraud of a party hereto in

Indemnitor to any Indemnitee (including pursuant to this _Article VIII_ ) in
connection with any claim or demand by any Person other than the parties or

stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in
respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim
relating to such claim or demand against any claimant or plaintiff asserting
such claim or demand. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnitor in
a reasonable manner, and at the cost of such Indemnitor, in presenting

agreement upon (i) the Parent IndemniteeÂ’s right for indemnification under
this Agreement and the amount of such Parent IndemniteeÂ’s Losses and (ii) the
amounts then available in the Escrow Fund that should be reserved (the "
_Reserved Amount_ ") in respect of such Claims Notice. Pending or absent a
mutual agreement of the Reserved Amount in respect of any Claims Notice, the
Reserved Amount therefor shall be the amount in good faith estimated by Parent
based on back-up documentation containing such detail as is reasonable under
the circumstances.

(b) If, after a period of thirty (30) days following receipt by the
Stockholder Representative of a Claims Notice, the Parent Indemnitee and the
Stockholder Representative have not succeeded in reaching an agreement upon
the Reserved Amount or, in the case of a Non-Third Party Claim only, the
liability of the Parent Indemnitee or the resolution of such Non-Third Party
Claim, each of Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall have the right
to submit the dispute at the earliest possible date to mediation conducted in
accordance with the Mediation Procedure of the International Institute for
Conflict Prevention and Resolution (" _CPR_ "); _provided_ that nothing in
this Section 8.9(b) shall affect or curtail ParentÂ’s unilateral right to make
an indemnity claim under this Article VIII or give any right to the mediator
to decide the validity of a Third Party Claim. The costs of such mediation
shall be borne by the Parent Indemnitee and the Stockholder Representative
(on behalf of the Stockholders) in inverse proportion to the amount with
respect to which each party prevails in the dispute (calculated in accordance
with Section 2.8(d)). The parties agree to participate in good faith in the
mediation and negotiations related thereto for a period of thirty (30) days or
such longer period as they may mutually agree following the initial mediation
session (the " _Mediation_  

 



57   _Period_ "). If the dispute has not been resolved for any reason after the
Mediation Period, the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to bring
suit in the applicable forum in accordance with this Agreement or to submit
the dispute over the Reserved Amount and, in the case of any Non-Third Party
Claim, the pending claim to arbitration conducted in New York City, before and
in accordance with the then-existing Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration
of the CPR (the " _Rules_ "). The arbitrator shall determine only those items
in dispute. In resolving any dispute, the Parties intend that the arbitrator
shall apply the substantive Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
any choice of law principles thereof that would mandate the application of the
laws of another jurisdiction. The Parties intend that the provisions to
arbitrate set forth herein be valid, enforceable and irrevocable, and any
award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties.
The Parties agree to comply and cause the applicable Indemnitees to comply
with any award made in any such arbitration proceedings and agree to
enforcement of or entry of judgment upon such award, in any court of
competent jurisdiction, including (a) the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, New York County, or (b) the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York.

 

(c) Upon the agreement by the Stockholder Representative and the Parent
Indemnitee or as finally determined in accordance with the procedures set
forth in _Section 8.9(b)_, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement to pay to the
Parent Indemnitee the lesser of (i) the amount of the Losses in respect of
such Claims Notice and (ii) the amounts then available in the Escrow Fund.

(d) On December 31, 2012, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement to pay to the
Stockholder Representative, acting in the name and on behalf of all of the
Stockholders, the excess of the amounts then available in the Escrow Fund
over the aggregate Reserved Amounts in respect of all unresolved claims for
indemnification made by the Parent Indemnitees prior to such date, in each
case, if any.

 

(e) From and after December 31, 2012, from time to time, upon (i) resolution
of any Claims Notice in respect of any individual claim for indemnification
made by the Parent Indemnitees and (ii) payment to the Parent Indemnitee of
the amount of such claim from the aggregate Reserved Amounts then available in
the Escrow Fund, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the Stockholder Representative, in the
name and on behalf of all of the Stockholders, the excess of the amounts then
available in the Escrow Fund over the aggregate Reserved Amounts in respect
of all remaining unresolved claims for indemnification made by the Parent
Indemnitees prior to such date, in each case, if any.

(f) All income earned in respect of the Escrow Account shall be for the
benefit of the Stockholders.

 



58 ARTICLE IX

_MISCELLANEOUS_

SECTION 9.1. _Disclosure Schedule_ s. (a) If a disclosure is made in one of
or in any part of any of the Disclosure Schedules, such disclosure will be
deemed to have also been made in each other part of the Disclosure Schedules
to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other part of the
Disclosure Schedules is reasonably apparent on its face. The reference to or
listing, description, disclosure or other inclusion of any item or other
matter, including any charge, violation, breach, debt, obligation or
liability, in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be construed to be an
admission or suggestion that such item or matter constitutes a violation of,
breach or default under, any contract, agreement, note, lease or otherwise. No
disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or
violation of any agreement, Applicable Law or regulation shall be construed as
an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. Notwithstanding the use of the terms "material" and
"Company Material Adverse Effect" and "Parent Material Adverse Effect" in this
Agreement, the inclusion of any particular disclosure in the attached
Disclosure Schedules shall not, of itself, mean that the item or matter so
disclosed is material, is required to be disclosed or would be likely to
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be. Such disclosure shall not be used as a basis
for interpreting the term "material," "materially," "materiality," "Company
Material Adverse Effect," "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or any similar
qualification in this Agreement.

 

(b) From time to time prior to the Effective Time, the Company may amend or
supplement the Disclosure Schedules relating to any representation or
warranty contained in Article IV with respect to any matter that, if existing
at or prior to the Closing Date, would have been required to be set forth or
described on the Disclosure Schedules or that is necessary to complete or
correct any information in any representation or warranty contained in Article
IV; _provided_ , _however_ , that such updated Disclosure Schedules may only
reflect changes in fact which occur after the date hereof and such updated
Disclosure Schedules shall not have any effect for purposes of (y) determining
whether there has been a breach of a representation or warranty for purposes
of the StockholdersÂ’ indemnification obligations set forth in _Article VIII_
or (z) determining the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in _Section
3.2(b)_.

SECTION 9.2. _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
duly executed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company and Parent, or in
the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. No
failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

SECTION 9.3. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by a Party by
operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
Party hereto and any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent
shall be void and of no effect.

 



59 SECTION 9.4. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Annexes,
Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein or delivered under this Agreement),
the other Transaction Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement and any
agreement between Parent and/or Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company
and/or the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, making specific
reference to this _Section 9.4_ constitute the entire agreement between the
Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior express or implied agreements and understandings, whether
written or oral, among the Parties.

SECTION 9.5. _Parties in Interest; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon and enforceable by
and against, the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, whether or not so expressed. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person other than
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective successors or permitted
assigns, any legal or equitable rights, benefits or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Closing occurs, the
Indemnified Persons are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to the protections of,  _Section 6.4_.

SECTION 9.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed and delivered in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original by the Party executing such counterpart, but all of
which shall be considered one and the same instrument. The execution and
delivery of the signature page, including the electronic delivery of the
actual signature, by any Party will constitute the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by such Party.

SECTION 9.7. _Section Headings_. The article, section and paragraph headings
and table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.9. _Remedies_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy permitted hereunder,
including seeking damages, and the exercise by a Party of any one such remedy

Parent and their respective Affiliates and further agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its terms and further agree that, although
monetary damages may be available for the breach of such covenants and
undertakings, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor.
Accordingly, each Party hereto agrees, on behalf of themselves and their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub,
on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set

breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the other under this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction. In the event
that any Action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereto hereby waives the
defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

(c) The Parties understand and agree that, except with respect to claims
based on fraud, the remedies expressly set forth in this Agreement shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties hereto for any claim
arising under this Agreement against any other Party hereto following the

of itself and each of its Affiliates, from and after Closing, to the fullest
extent

action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction.

SECTION 9.11. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury
Trial; Process Agent_. (a) Each of the Parties (i) consent to submit itself to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of any Federal court located in

of all such acts as may be necessary or appropriate in order to confer
jurisdiction over it before the aforementioned courts and Parent stipulates
that such consent and appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 

SECTION 9.12. _Time for Performance_. Time is of the essence with regard to
any time, date or period set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

SECTION 9.13. _No Right of Set-Off_. Except for its right to make claims

been jointly drafted by the Parties and this Agreement shall not be construed
against any Party as the principal draftsperson hereof or thereof.

SECTION 9.15. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any
provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion
thereof), or the application of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to
any Person or entity or any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal
or unenforceable by any Applicable Law, Order or public policy, (i) the
Parties shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of
this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify
this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable with a valid, legal and enforceable provision giving
effect to the original intent of the Parties and (ii) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons, entities or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision, or the
application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 9.16. _Stockholder Representative_. (a) The parties have agreed that
it is desirable to designate a Stockholder Representative to act on behalf of
holders of the Company Common Stock and the Options for certain limited
purposes, as specified herein. The parties have designated Centerbridge
Advisors, LLC as the initial Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholders
Approval will expressly ratify and approve such designation. The Stockholder
Representative is hereby appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact, for each
Stockholder with full power of substitution to act in the name, place and
stead of such Stockholder with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to act on behalf of such Stockholder in any amendment of or
litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and
to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and to execute
all such documents, as the Stockholder Representative shall deem necessary or
appropriate in conjunction with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including the power:

 

(i) to take all action necessary or desirable in connection with the waiver of
any condition to the obligations of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(ii) to negotiate, execute and deliver all ancillary agreements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments and other documents required or permitted to be given
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (it being understood that the Company
and any Stockholders, shall execute and deliver any such documents which the
Stockholder Representative agree to execute);

 



64 (iii) to terminate this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement if they or
the Company are entitled to do so;

(iv) to give and receive all notices, communications and funds to be given
or received under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and to receive
service of process in connection with any claims under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, including service of process in connection with arbitration;

 

(v) to bring or defend any claim or action on behalf of the Stockholders to
enforce their rights under this Agreement and in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

(vi) to take all actions which under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
may be taken by or on behalf of any Stockholder and to do or refrain from
doing any further act or deed on behalf of any Stockholder which the
Stockholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate in their
sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement as fully and completely as such Stockholders could do if
personally present.

 

(b) The Company hereby agrees that Parent, the Paying Agent and the Escrow
Agent shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of
the Stockholder Representative as to the settlement of any claims against the
Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, or as to any actions required
or permitted to be taken by the Stockholder Representative hereunder or under
the Escrow Agreement.

(c) The Stockholder Representative will not be liable for any act taken or
omitted by it as permitted under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
except if such act is taken or omitted in bad faith or gross negligence. The
Stockholder Representative will also be fully protected in relying upon any
written notice, demand, certificate or document that it in good faith
believes to be genuine (including facsimiles thereof).

(d) The Stockholders shall, severally but not jointly, indemnify (on a pro
rata basis based upon their respective Percentage Share) the Stockholder
Representative for, and to hold the Stockholder Representative harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative, arising out of or in
connection with the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s carrying out its duties
under this Agreement, including costs and expenses of successfully defending
the Stockholder Representative against any claim of liability with respect
thereto. The Stockholder Representative may consult with counsel of its own
choice and will have full and complete authorization and protection for any
action taken and suffered by it in good faith and in accordance with the
opinion of such counsel.

 

(e) If Centerbridge Advisors, LLC resigns in writing as Stockholder
Representative or otherwise becomes unable to serve as a Stockholder
Representative, stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time may designate as
a successor Stockholder 

 



65  Representative either (i) an affiliate of Centerbridge Advisors, LLC or (ii)
with the written consent of Parent, any other person (the " _Successor
Stockholder Representative_ "). Upon written acceptance by such Successor
Stockholder Representative to serve as a Stockholder Representative, such
Successor Stockholder Representative shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all of the powers and duties and obligations of the applicable
original Stockholder Representative without further act, and such original
Stockholder Representative shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder but shall continue to have the benefits of the indemnification set
forth in this _Section 9.16_. Notwithstanding any replacement of such
original Stockholder Representative hereunder, the provisions of this _Section
9.16_ shall continue in effect for the benefit of such original Stockholder
Representative with respect to all actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while acting as a Stockholder Representative. All of the indemnities,
immunities and powers granted to the Stockholder Representatives under
this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or termination of this
Agreement.

(f) The grant of authority to the Stockholder Representative provided for in
this _Section 9.16_ is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and
shall survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any
Stockholder, and shall survive the Closing. 

(g) All out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal, accounting and other
advisorsÂ’ fees and expenses, if applicable) reasonably incurred by the
Stockholder Representative in performing any actions under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement will be paid out of the Escrow Amount, from time to time,
as and when such fees and expenses are incurred.
