 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement: 

  

  

 (i) the maximum aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to this  _Article III_ shall be equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (A) sixty percent (60%) multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Maximum Cash Conversion Number_ "); 

   

 (ii) the minimum aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to this  _Article III_ shall be equal to the product (rounded up to the nearest whole share) of (A) forty percent (40%) multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Minimum Cash Conversion Number_ "); and 

  

 (iii) if the Cash Elections and Share Elections would result in the payment by Parent of Cash Consideration in respect of a number of shares of Company Common Stock greater than the 

  

      

  

Maximum Cash Conversion Number or less than the Minimum Cash Conversion
Number, the Cash Consideration and Share Consideration shall be allocated
among former holders of Company Common Stock as set forth in _Section
3.2(b)_.

  

  

 (b) Within two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among former holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Share Consideration as follows: 

  

  

 (i) If the Cash Election Number is less than or equal to the Maximum Cash Conversion Number and greater than or equal to the Minimum Cash Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and all Non-Electing Shares and Share Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration, in each case in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_. 

  

 (ii) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (the " _Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Maximum Cash Conversion Number, then (A) all Share Election Shares and all Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)(ii)(B)_ and _Section 3.1(a)(ii)(C)_, _respectively_ and (B) Cash Election Shares held by a holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Maximum Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number, with the remaining number of such holder\'s Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration. 

   

 (iii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Minimum Cash Conversion Number (the amount of such difference, the " _Minimum Cash Conversion Number Shortfall_ "), then (A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in accordance with  _Section 3.1(a)(ii)(A)_, (B)(1) if the aggregate number of all Non-Electing Shares is less than or equal to the Minimum Cash Conversion Number Shortfall, all Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration or (2) if the aggregate number of all Non-Electing Shares is more than the Minimum Cash Conversion Number Shortfall, the Non-Electing Shares held by a holder shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Electing Shares held by such holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Electing Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is Minimum Cash Conversion Number Shortfall and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of all Non-Electing Shares, with the remaining number of such holder\'s Non-Electing Shares being converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration and (C)(1) if the Cash Election Number plus the aggregate number of all Non-Electing Shares is less than the Minimum Cash Conversion Number (the amount of such difference, the " _Additional Shortfall_ "), Share Election Shares held by a holder will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Share Election Shares held by such holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Share Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Additional Shortfall and the denominator of which is the Share Election Number, with the remaining number of such holder\'s Share Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration, and (2) if there is no Additional Shortfall, all Share Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration in accordance with  _Section 3.1(a)(ii)(B)_. 

  

  

 Section 3.3 _ _ _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Holder_ ") shall have the right, 

        

subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article III_, to submit an
election on or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the following
procedures:

  

 (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.3_ (an " _Election_ ") (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Share Election and (ii) the number of other shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, a Holder may not make both a Share Election and a Cash Election with respect to the same share of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder. 

  

 (b) Prior to effectiveness of the Form S-4, Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit thereto a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Form of Election_ "), which shall be mailed by the Company to record holders of Company Common Stock so as to permit those holders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline. 

  

 (c) The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered, as applicable, the Form of Election to record holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline (the " _Mailing Date_ "). Parent shall make available one or more Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders or beneficial owners of Company Common Stock during the period following the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting and prior to the Election Deadline. 

  

 (d) Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent, which shall be an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of receiving Elections and transferring Book-Entry Shares and exchanging shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates for Merger Consideration, pursuant to an exchange agent agreement reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company entered into prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "). Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed, with such Form of Election either electing to transfer Book-Entry Shares or accompanied by Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); _provided_ , that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to deliver Certificates covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Company and Parent, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the Business Day immediately prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting. 

  

 (e) Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, or any documents in respect of Book-Entry Shares, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. After an Election is validly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, any subsequent transfer of such shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically revoke such Election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Elections shall be automatically 

        

deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification
from Parent or the Company that this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with  _Article IX_. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent
Agreement and this Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine if any Election is not properly made with respect to
any shares of Company Common Stock (neither Parent nor the Company nor the
Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any stockholder of any
such defect); in the event the Exchange Agent makes such a determination,
such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company
Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed
to be Non-Electing Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made
with respect to such shares.

  

 (f) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent and the Company, in the exercise of their reasonable discretion, shall have the joint right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by  _Section 3.2_, (ii) the issuance and delivery of certificates representing the number of Parent Common Shares into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted into the right to receive in the Merger and (iii) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares. 

  

 Section 3.4 _ _ _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, at the Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with this  _Article III_, (a) evidence of Parent Common Shares in book-entry form issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ equal to the aggregate Share Consideration and (b) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.13_) (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Entity. Interest and other income on the Exchange Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Entity and shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Entity, as Parent directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this  _Article III_, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy Parent\'s obligations hereunder for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. 

  

 Section 3.5 _ _ _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share immediately prior to the Effective Time a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of any Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, in such form as the Company and Parent may reasonably agree. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of any Book-Entry Share for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (which, to the extent it is Share Consideration, shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) in respect of the shares of Company 

        

Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares.

   

 Section 3.6 _ _ _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, Persons who held shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Entity for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. 

  

 Section 3.7 _ _ _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the Parent Common Shares issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Agreement, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of Book-Entry Shares there shall be paid to the record holder of the Parent Common Shares, if any, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender or transfer payable with respect to such Parent Common Shares. 

  

 Section 3.8 _ _ _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any applicable dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares) to which they are entitled under this  _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Entity for payment of their claims with respect thereto. 

   

 Section 3.9 _ _ _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of any cash that would have otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 3.10 _ _ _Withholding Rights_. Each Parent Party, the Company, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other amounts or property otherwise payable or distributable to any Person pursuant to this 

        

Agreement such amounts or property (or portions thereof) as such Parent
Party, the Company, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent determines it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
or distribution under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of applicable Law. In the case of any noncash
payment or distribution, the applicable withholding party may collect the
amount required to be withheld by reducing to cash for remittance to the
appropriate Governmental Entity a sufficient portion of the property that
the recipient would otherwise receive or own if the cash portion of any such
payment or distribution is not sufficient to cover the withholding liability,
and the recipient Party will bear any brokerage or other costs for this
withholding procedure. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity by a Parent Party, the
Company, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Parent Party, the Company, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable.

  

 Section 3.11 _ _ _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this  _Article III_. 

  

 Section 3.12 _ _ _Dissenters\' Rights_. No dissenters\' or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 3.13 _ _ _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or with respect to transfer of Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Common Share shall receive (aggregating for this purpose all the Parent Common Shares such holder is entitled to receive hereunder), in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the product of (a) such fractional part of a Parent Common Share, multiplied by (b) the closing price per Parent Common Share on the New York Stock Exchange (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and the Company) for the last full trading day ending immediately prior to the Closing Date.

The Company\'s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and nonfinancial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar

No Parent Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. As of their respective filing dates, the Parent SEC Documents (a) did not (or with respect to Parent SEC Documents filed after the date hereof, will not) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (b) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. All of the audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of Parent included in Parent SEC Documents (including, in each case, any 

        

notes or schedules thereto) (collectively, the " _Parent Financial
Statements_ "), (i) have been or will be, as the case may be, prepared from,
are in accordance with, and accurately reflect the books and records of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in all material respects, (ii) have been or

consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of interim financial statements, for normal
and recurring year-end adjustments and as may be permitted by the SEC on Form
10-Q, Form 8-K or and Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act, which such
adjustments are not, in the aggregate, material to Parent), and comply or
will comply, as the case may be, as to form in all material respects with the
applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
and the related rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (iii) fairly
present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, as of the respective dates thereof, and
the consolidated results of their operations, and, where included, their
consolidated shareholders\' equity and their consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods indicated (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments (which are not material in
significance or amount)). No financial statements of any Person other than
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of Parent. Except as required by GAAP and
disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents, since January 1, 2011, Parent has not

Parent\'s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and nonfinancial) required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Parent\'s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent\'s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent\'s disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on Parent management\'s most recently completed evaluation of Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting, (a) Parent had no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Parent\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (b) Parent does not have Knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting.

give rise to "redetermined rents", "redetermined deductions" or "excess
interest" as each is described in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code. No event has
occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a
material risk that any material amount of Tax described in the previous
sentence will be imposed upon Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

pursuant to  _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive Acquisition
Agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal, if and only if, (A) a written
Competing Proposal that was not solicited in violation of this _Section 6.3_
is made to the Company by a third party and such Competing Proposal is not
withdrawn, and (B) prior to taking such action, the Company Board has
determined in good faith (y) after consultation with the Company\'s outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
their directors\' duties under applicable Maryland Law and (z) after

advisors, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with any such Competing Proposal
(1) the Company has given Parent at least five (5) Business Days\' prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
include the information with respect to such Superior Proposal that
is specified in _Section 6.3(c)_ as well as a copy of any proposal,
agreement and all material documentation providing for such Superior
Proposal), (2) Parent and the Company have negotiated, and have caused their
respective Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the other Party
and its Representatives, to the extent the other Party wishes to negotiate,
during such notice period to enable the other Party to propose in writing
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) following
the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good
faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent
and shall have determined that, after consultation with the Company\'s
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be
given effect and (4) in the event of any change to the material terms of such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent
an additional notice consistent with that described in subclause (1) above
and the notice period shall have recommenced, except that the notice period
shall be at least three (3) Business Days. Unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with _Section 9.1_, the Company Board shall submit
this Agreement to its stockholders even if the Company Board shall have
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, and the Company Board may not

 (a) Unless, and to the extent, Parent and Merger Sub have sufficient cash from other sources sufficient to consummate the Merger, the Transactions and to pay the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to _Section 3.13_, all other amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and any other related fees and expenses, and for the Refinancing (the " _Necessary Financing_ ") (including pursuant to any Alternate Financing or other alternative financing), each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the full amount of the Financing (or such portion of the Financing as Parent determines to be necessary, together with cash from other sources (including pursuant to any Alternate Financing or other alternative financing), to satisfy its obligations under _Section 5.28(d)_ and for the Refinancing), on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter (as it may be amended in accordance with the provisions below), after giving effect to the market flex terms in the Redacted Fee Letter, and shall not (without the written consent of the Company) permit any amendment or modification to be made to (other than to amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, co-agents, lead arrangers or similar entities who have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or to reassign titles), or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter or the Redacted Fee Letter, if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing (taking into account any Alternate Financing or other alternative financing and any cash from other sources) such that Parent or Merger Sub would be unable to pay (A) the Cash Consideration, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to  _Section 3.13_ and (C) all other amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date and any other related fees and expenses) or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing or other terms in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent the Closing, or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur, other than a waiver of any closing conditions by the lead arrangers, lenders or agents or (C) relieve any Financing Source of any of its funding commitments under the Commitment Letter without replacement thereof as provided below; _provided_ that Parent shall have the right to substitute other financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources and to replace any Financing Sources with any other financing sources and in connection therewith relieve any such replaced Financing Source of all or a portion of its funding commitments under the Commitment Letter;  _provided_ , _further_ , that such substitution shall only be permitted if (1) the terms thereof would not be reasonably expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing or make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur and (2) the conditions to the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter would not be expanded or modified in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing. Any reference in this Agreement to (I) "Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as amended or modified in compliance with this _Section 7.10(a)_ and (II) "Commitment Letter," and "Redacted Fee Letter" shall include such documents as amended or modified in compliance with this _Section 7.10(a)_.

the Commitment Letter and consummate the Financing at or prior to the
Closing. Parent and Merger Sub shall inform the Company on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain the
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub shall give the Company prompt notice after becoming aware of (A) any
material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result
in a material breach or default) by any party to the Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreement related thereto, (B) any termination of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and/or (C) the implementation of any of
the flex provisions in order to effect all or any portion of the Financing,
if such flex provisions would be reasonably expected to prevent or materially
delay the Closing.

  

 (c) If, notwithstanding the use of commercially reasonable efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations under _Section 7.10(a)_ and  _Section 7.10(b)_, the Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Parent so as to materially delay or prevent the Closing, for any reason and in whole or in part, prior to the Closing (including as a result of a breach or repudiation), or if any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable (and such portion is necessary for Parent to obtain the Necessary Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter (other than as a result of obtaining substitute debt financing in accordance with _Section 7.10(a)_) or unless, and to the extent, Parent has sufficient cash from other sources available to satisfy the Necessary Financing (including pursuant to any Alternate Financing or other alternative financing), Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange promptly to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms (including, without limitation, as it relates to economic provisions and the payment of fees, compensation and expenses and any flex provisions contained therein) and in an amount such that the aggregate funds together with other financial resources of Parent and Merger Sub, including any remaining portion of the Financing and any alternative financing, any proceeds from the Healthcare Properties Sale and any other cash on hand and marketable securities of Parent and Merger Sub that would be available to Parent and Merger Sub at the Closing will be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Necessary Financing (the " _Alternate Financing_ ") and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternate Financing (the " _New Commitment Letter_ "), which shall replace the existing Commitment Letter to the extent such Alternate Financing replaces the Financing. Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such expiration, termination or unavailability referred to in the first sentence of this _Section 7.10(c)_ and the reason therefor, and shall provide a true, correct and complete copy of such New Commitment Letter to the Company (which may include redactions as specified therein). In the event any New Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" shall mean the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as such reference is modified pursuant to clause (ii) below (and include, if applicable, any debt securities issued in lieu of any such financing), (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letter to the extent that it is not superseded by a New Commitment Letter at the time in question and, to the extent so superseded, the New Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to "Redacted Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any fee or other letter relating to the Commitment Letter that is not superseded by a New Commitment Letter at the time in question and the New Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect.

 (ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in the event that (A) the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) following the disclosure or announcement of a Competing Proposal with respect to the Company (other than a tender offer or exchange offer described in clause (C) below), the Company Board shall have failed to reaffirm publicly the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after Parent requests in writing that such recommendation under such circumstances be reaffirmed publicly, (C) a tender offer or exchange offer is commenced that would, if consummated, constitute a Competing Proposal with respect to the Company and the Company Board shall have failed to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders (including, for these purposes, by taking any position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 of the Exchange Act other than recommending rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer (or, in the event of a change in the terms of the tender offer or exchange offer, within ten (10) Business Days of the announcement of such changes), (D) the Company Board publicly announces an intention to take any of the foregoing actions in clauses (A)-(C), or (E) the Company shall have breached its obligations under _Section 6.3_ or its obligations pursuant to the third sentence of _Section 6.4(c)_, in each case in any material respect.

and (2) the Company, within twelve (12) months after the termination of this
Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding, or executes a definitive

arising from such Competing Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that for

 (ii) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the Parent Termination Payment on more than one occasion; 

  

      

  

 (iii) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the Parent Expense Amount on more than one occasion; and 

  

 (iv) under no circumstances shall Parent be required to pay the Company Expense Amount on more than one occasion. 

  

  

 (c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the Parent Termination Payment is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without this agreement, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company or Parent fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other Party for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 9.3_, such other Party shall pay the prevailing Party its costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%) for the period from the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law. 

  

 (d) 

  

  

 (i) If the Company (the " _Termination Payor_ ") is required to pay Parent (the " _Termination Payee_ ") the Parent Termination Payment such payment shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to be paid by the Termination Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with _Section 9.3(d)(ii)_. The amount payable to the Termination Payee in any tax year of the Termination Payee shall not exceed the lesser of (A) the Parent Termination Payment payable to the Termination Payee, and (B) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Termination Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and the Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by the Termination Payee\'s independent accountants, plus (2) in the event the Termination Payee receives either (x) a letter from the Termination Payee\'s counsel indicating that the Termination Payee has received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this _Section 9.3(d)_ or (y) an opinion from the Termination Payee\'s outside counsel as described below in this _Section 9.3(d)_, an amount equal to the excess of the Parent Termination Payment less the amount payable under clause (1) above. 

  

 (ii) To secure the Termination Payor\'s obligation to pay the Parent Termination Payment, the Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Parent Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Termination Payor on such terms (subject to this _Section 9.3(d)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Parent Termination Payment pursuant to this  _Section 9.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the Termination Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Payee such amount pursuant to this  _Section 9.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Parent Termination Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Termination Payee unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (A) a letter from the Termination Payee\'s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Termination Payee 

  

      

  

without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the Termination Payee has
$1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount
to the Termination Payee, or (B) a letter from the Termination Payee\'s
counsel indicating that (1) the Termination Payee received a ruling from the
IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the Parent
Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code or (2) the Termination Payee\'s outside counsel has rendered a
legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the
Parent Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or
should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Parent Termination Payment to the Termination Payee. The
Termination Payor agrees to amend this  _Section 9.3(d)_ at the reasonable
request of the Termination Payee in order to (y) maximize the portion of the
Parent Termination Payment that may be distributed to the Termination Payee
hereunder without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (z) assist
the Termination Payee in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from
its outside counsel, in each case, as described in this _Section 9.3(d)_. Any
amount of the Parent Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of
a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this  _Section 9.3(d)_.
