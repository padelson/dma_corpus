such funds shall be paid to Parent.

holder of record of (x)&nbsp;a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (the &#147;<B><I>Company Certificates</I></B>&#148;) and (y)&nbsp;any

have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates and Book Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;1.6(b)</U>. Exchange of any Book Entry Shares
shall be effected in accordance with the Exchange Agent&#146;s customary procedures with respect to
securities represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate or Book Entry
Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate or Book Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, and the Company
Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to make all payments required pursuant to the preceding sentence as soon as
practicable following the valid surrender of Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the

such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their Company Certificates and Book Entry Shares,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered

hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company. The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
to which Parent reasonably objects.

Employees shall continue after the Effective Time to participate in such assumed Company
Employee Benefit Plans. At such time as determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
Parent&#146;s approval, Acquired Employees shall participate in Parent&#146;s compensation, severance, bonus,
stock option and other incentive plans for which they are eligible pursuant to the terms and
conditions of such plans, or in similar plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation, in each case
consistent with the participation offered to Parent&#146;s employees holding similar positions. Each

with the Company (including any predecessors) for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate,
and eligibility for early retirement subsidies and vacation time, but not for purposes of benefit
accrual, except as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;5.2(d)</U>. No Acquired Employee shall be
simultaneously covered under similar employee benefit plans of Parent or the Surviving Corporation

Parent Defined Benefit Plan has not previously been terminated or frozen for purposes of future
benefit accruals, (i)&nbsp;all participants in the Company Defined Benefit Plan will participate in the
Parent Defined Benefit Plan and shall accrue benefits beginning immediately following the merger of
the plans to the same extent as similarly-situated participants in the Parent Defined Benefit Plan
who are not Acquired Employees and (ii)&nbsp;benefits for Acquired Employees under the merged plan shall
be determined using a &#147;two piece&#148; benefit formula, using for purposes of calculating the benefit
under both pieces the participant&#146;s compensation at any time before or after the effective date of
the plan merger (the &#147;<B><I>Plan Merger</I></B>&#148;). The first piece of the benefit will be calculated using the
formula under the Company Defined Benefit Plan and shall use, for purposes of the calculation, all
service with the Company, Parent or its affiliates prior to the &#147;Plan Merger Date&#148; but no service
after the Plan Merger Date, and the second piece will be calculated using the formula under the
Parent Defined Benefit Plan that applies to similarly-
situated plan participants who are not Acquired Employees and shall use, for purposes of the
calculation, all service with the Company, Parent of any of their affiliates after the Plan Merger
Date, but no service prior to the Plan Merger Date. The formula used for calculating benefits
under the Company Defined Benefit Plan shall not be amended after the Effective Time, and the
Company Defined Benefit Plan shall not be terminated or frozen for purposes of future benefit
accruals before the effective date as of which Parent terminates or freezes all future accruals
under, as the case may be, all of its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Acquired Employee shall accrue benefits under both the Company Defined
Benefit Plan and the Parent Defined Benefit Plan for the same period of service.
