 Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 22, 2006, among Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), APC Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Kerr-McGee Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 _INTRODUCTION_  

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) approved this Agreement. 

  

 WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined in _Section 2.4(a)_ ) of the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in  _Section 1.2_) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 1.6(d)_), will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in _Section 1.6(b))_. 

  

 In consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

 Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement and the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company.

 SECTION 1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. 

  

 (a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (Central time) on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived on the Closing Date), at the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, 1111 Louisiana Street, 44th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002 unless another date, time or place 

   ##### 

  

    

is agreed to in writing between Parent and the Company. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". As
used in this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " means any day that is not a
Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banks are required or authorized by
law to be closed in New York, New York. 

  

 (b) On the Closing Date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger, in accordance with the DGCL, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") (the time of such filing (or such later time as is specified in such Certificate of Merger as agreed between Parent and the Company) being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 SECTION 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. 

  

 At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in Section 259 of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and the Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. 

  

 At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to read in its entirety in the form of Exhibit A hereto, and, as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to read in their entirety in the form of Exhibit B hereto, and, as so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or the election of their successors. The Company shall cause all directors of the Company to resign immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or the election of their successors. 

  

 SECTION 1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_. 

  

 As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any other holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub or the Company: 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $1.00 per share, and such shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the capital stock of Merger Sub shall represent all of the outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares and any shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_) shall be cancelled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $70.50 in cash payable to the holder thereof and subject to increase as provided in the following sentence (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, if the Effective Time does not occur on or prior to August 10, 2006, the Merger Consideration shall increase at a daily rate of $0.01255 for each day subsequent thereto until the Effective Time occurs; provided however, that the Merger Consideration shall not in any case exceed $71.0271 (after taking into effect the adjustments contemplated by this sentence). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and, subject to _Section 1.6(d)_, each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) _Treatment of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by any Subsidiary of Company shall not be cancelled at the Effective Time and shall remain outstanding. 

  

 (d) _Shares of Company Common Stock of Dissenting Stockholders_. 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands in writing an appraisal of the "fair value" of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.6(b)_ , but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, that, any Dissenting Shares held by holders of Company Common Stock who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights for an appraisal of such shares under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and terminated, as of the Effective Time, and shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.6(b)_, upon surrender in the manner provided in _Section 1.7_, of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) The Company shall give to Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and (ii) the Company and Parent shall jointly direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make any payment with respect to any such demands, or offer to settle, or settle, any such demands. Any amount payable to any holder of Company Common Stock exercising appraisal rights shall be paid solely by the Surviving Corporation out of its own funds. 

  

 SECTION 1.7 _Payment for Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive in trust the funds to which holders of Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Companys stockholders, cash in an amount sufficient for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.6(b)_ upon surrender of certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock as provided herein (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund in obligations guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. All interest earned on such funds shall be paid to Parent. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event not later than five Business days thereafter, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of (x) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ ") and (y) any non-certificated shares held by book entry (" _Book Entry Shares_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates and Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.6(b)_. Exchange of any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate or Book Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, and the Company Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make all payments required pursuant to the preceding sentence as soon as practicable following the valid surrender of Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Company Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of 

    ##### 

 

    

the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 1.7(b)_, each Company Certificate and Book
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on
the cash payable upon the surrender of any Company Certificate or Book Entry
Share. All amounts payable hereunder to a holder of Company Stock shall be
rounded to the nearest cent. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer Books_. All cash paid upon the surrender of Company Certificates and Book Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for cash as provided in this _Article I_. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) which has not been disbursed to holders of Company Certificates and Book Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their Company Certificates and Book Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any payment pursuant to this _Article I _would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, the Merger Consideration in respect of such Company Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. As used in this Agreement, " _Governmental Authority_ " shall mean any United States federal, state, local or any foreign government, governmental, regulatory or administrative authority, agency, or commission or any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body or entity. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Certificates evidencing Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger Consideration required pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_, in 

   ##### 

  

 

exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit, which shall include indemnities and the posting of a
bond which are acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the holder thereof with
such assurances as the Paying Agent, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration may reasonably require of
the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement any stock transfer taxes and such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

For purposes hereof, the Company will be deemed to be " _Insolvent_ " if any of the conditions described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above are applicable to the Company prior to the Effective Time.

 (a) Within five Business Days of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub, will furnish to the Company the information relating to Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement, and Parent and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof in definitive form with the SEC. The Company will advise Parent promptly after it receives notice of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably objects. 

  

 (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, and in accordance with the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable law, establish a record date (which will be as soon as practicable after the date hereof) for, duly call, give notice of a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the Company determines at any time that this Agreement or the Merger is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject this Agreement or the Merger. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby in compliance with _Section 5.8_ in circumstances where a Takeover Proposal is outstanding, (1) as soon as practicable following the date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Companys stockholders, the Company shall convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and (2) once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (other than (i) for the absence of a quorum or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which it believes in good faith is necessary under applicable law and for such 

   ##### 

  

    

supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the

that in the event that the Company Stockholders Meeting is delayed to a date
after the Termination Date (as defined in _Section 7.1(b)_) as a result of
either (i) or (ii) above, then the Termination Date shall be extended to the
fifth Business Day after such date). The Board of Directors of the Company
shall declare that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and recommend that this Agreement be adopted
by the stockholders of the Company and include in the Proxy Statement a copy
of such recommendations; provided that the Board of Directors of the Company
may withdraw, modify or change such recommendation in compliance with
_Section 5.8_. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has withdrawn
its recommendations of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby in compliance with _Section 5.8_, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders of
the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent
of stockholders required by applicable law to effect the Merger. 

  

 (c) Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary to be voted in favor of the adoption of the Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 5.2 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

  

 From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have the rights and obligations described in this Section 5.2 regarding the individuals who were employees of the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Acquired Employees_ "). 

  

 (a) _Employment_. All Acquired Employees shall be employed solely on an "at will" basis, except to the extent required by the provisions of written employment contracts or as required by applicable law. 

  

 (b) _Benefit Plans_. The Surviving Corporation shall assume the Company Employee Benefit Plans as of the Effective Time and operate such plans in accordance with their respective terms, and the Company shall take any steps necessary to permit such assumption. Acquired Employees shall continue after the Effective Time to participate in such assumed Company Employee Benefit Plans. At such time as determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation with Parents approval, Acquired Employees shall participate in Parents compensation, severance, bonus, stock option and other incentive plans for which they are eligible pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plans, or in similar plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation, in each case consistent with the participation offered to Parents employees holding similar positions. Each such plan shall grant credit to each Acquired Employee for all service prior to the Effective Time with the Company (including any predecessors) for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, and eligibility for early retirement subsidies and vacation time, but not for purposes of benefit accrual, except as provided in _Section 5.2(d)_. No Acquired Employee shall be simultaneously covered under similar employee benefit plans of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and of the Company. Nothing in this _Section 5.2_ shall restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any assumed Company Employee Benefit Plan or to modify any compensation arrangement of any Acquired 

   ##### 

  

    

Employee for any reason at any time (in each case subject to the provisions
of any written employment contracts); _provided, however_ , that the post-
retirement health benefits plans of the Company shall be continued unchanged
(except as required by law) at least until the earlier of the third
anniversary of the Effective Time or the date on which Parent terminates all
post-retirement health benefits plan; and provided, further, that the
severance and retention benefit plans of the Company shall be continued
unchanged (except as required by law) at least until the first anniversary of
the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _Group Health Plans_. During the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, any group health plan established or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, with respect to any eligible Acquired Employee or, as applicable, a family member of an eligible Acquired Employee, (i) waive any waiting period, (ii) waive any exclusion or limitation for preexisting conditions which were covered under any group health plan maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, (iii) grant credit (for purposes of annual deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket limits) for any covered claims incurred or payments made prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) accept rollovers of the health flexible spending account and dependent care accounts of eligible Acquired Employees. 

  

 (d) _Qualified Defined Benefit Plans_. If the current Qualified Company Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (the " _Company Defined Benefit Plan_ ") is merged into the qualified defined benefit plan of Parent (the " _Parent Defined Benefit Plan_ ") and the Parent Defined Benefit Plan has not previously been terminated or frozen for purposes of future benefit accruals, (i) all participants in the Company Defined Benefit Plan will participate in the Parent Defined Benefit Plan and shall accrue benefits beginning immediately following the merger of the plans to the same extent as similarly-situated participants in the Parent Defined Benefit Plan who are not Acquired Employees and (ii) benefits for Acquired Employees under the merged plan shall be determined using a "two piece" benefit formula, using for purposes of calculating the benefit under both pieces the participants compensation at any time before or after the effective date of the plan merger (the " _Plan Merger_ "). The first piece of the benefit will be calculated using the formula under the Company Defined Benefit Plan and shall use, for purposes of the calculation, all service with the Company, Parent or its affiliates prior to the "Plan Merger Date" but no service after the Plan Merger Date, and the second piece will be calculated using the formula under the Parent Defined Benefit Plan that applies to similarly- situated plan participants who are not Acquired Employees and shall use, for purposes of the calculation, all service with the Company, Parent of any of their affiliates after the Plan Merger Date, but no service prior to the Plan Merger Date. The formula used for calculating benefits under the Company Defined Benefit Plan shall not be amended after the Effective Time, and the Company Defined Benefit Plan shall not be terminated or frozen for purposes of future benefit accruals before the effective date as of which Parent terminates or freezes all future accruals under, as the case may be, all of its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans. For the avoidance of doubt, no Acquired Employee shall accrue benefits under both the Company Defined Benefit Plan and the Parent Defined Benefit Plan for the same period of service. 

  

 (e) _SCORE Compensation Program_. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall calculate the compensation accrued under the SCORE Compensation Program as of the Effective Time. The amount due under the SCORE Compensation Program shall be paid to an Acquired Employee on the earliest to occur of (i) the 

   ##### 

  

    

Acquired Employees involuntary termination of employment other than for
cause, (ii) the date that Parent or the Surviving Corporation pay their 2006
annual incentive compensation, or (iii) March 15, 2007. If, before December
31, 2006, an Acquired Employee terminates employment voluntarily (other
than through retirement within the meaning of the SCORE Compensation Program)
or is terminated for cause, no payment shall be made under the SCORE
Compensation Program. The Acquired Employees who remain employed by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation through December 31, 2006, shall receive
an incentive bonus for the period between the Effective Time and December 31,
2006, equal to the amount received by a similarly-situated employee of Parent
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
between the Effective Time and December 31, 2006, and the denominator of
which is 365. 

  

 (f) Parent hereby assumes, absolutely and unconditionally, effective as of the Effective Time, each of the Continuity Agreements identified on Section 5.2(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

  

 SECTION 5.3 _Consents and Approvals_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the requirements of applicable antitrust laws, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five Business days) after the date of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed with (i) the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act; and (ii) the Competition Bureau any notifications required to be filed under the Competition Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The Company shall have the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to the Company; Parent shall have the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub; and each of the Company and Parent shall have the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case which appear in any material filing (including the Proxy Statement) made in connection with the 

   ##### 

  

    

transactions contemplated hereby. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
such necessary Permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all

Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the Companys DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the Companys existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this  _Section 5.9(c)_.
