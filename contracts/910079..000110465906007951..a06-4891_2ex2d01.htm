the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable Law.

  

SECTION 1.6. _Directors_. The parties shall cause the directors of Merger

equal to $27.00;

 **SECTION 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates._**

  

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall (i)
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the **"
Paying Agent"**), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent for
the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit with the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash
in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to
be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the **" Exchange Fund"**). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Acquiror; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which
are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the
Surviving Corporation.

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who was,
at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c):
 (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates representing such Shares (the **" Certificates"**) shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
(A) a Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto and (B) such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, after giving effect to any
withholding tax pursuant to Section 2.2(f), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if the Certificate representing such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Acquiror that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled
pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II.

       

(c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company,
except as provided herein.

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquiror, upon
demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Acquiror for, and Acquiror shall remain liable for, payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Laws).

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Paying Agent, Merger Sub, Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any such shares of Company Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation and Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax laws. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Acquiror, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Acquiror, as the case may be.

  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

  

SECTION 2.3. _Stock Transfer Books. _At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Acquiror for any reason shall
be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

  

SECTION 2.4. _Stock Options. _As of the Effective Time, each
then outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a **"
Company Stock Option"**), whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled
by the Company and in consideration of such cancellation, the Company shall
pay to each holder thereof (and, if requested by the Company, Acquiror shall
provide cash to the Company for such Payment) at the Effective Time in cash,
net of withholding, an amount per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such cancelled Company Stock Option equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
Merger Consideration, over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Company
Stock Option (the **" Option Consideration"**). The Company shall take all
actions necessary to terminate the Company Equity Plans as of the Effective
Time.

  

SECTION 2.5. _Dissenters  Rights. _No dissenters or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

SECTION 2.6. _Restricted Shares. _The Company shall take such actions as
are necessary so that as of the Effective Time, each share of
restricted Company Common Stock which as of the Closing Date is

       

issued and outstanding but not vested, shall fully vest. At the Effective
Time, each issued and outstanding share of restricted Company Common Stock
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.1(c).

  

 **ARTICLE III**

  

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  

Except as set forth in the separate disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to Acquiror prior to the execution of this Agreement (the **" Company
Disclosure Schedule"**), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Acquiror and Merger Sub as follows:

  

SECTION 3.1. _Incorporation._

good standing under the laws of the state of Maryland. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and,
subject to the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote on the Merger
(the **" Required Company Stockholder Approval"**), to carry out its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Company has made available to Acquiror or its advisors complete and
correct copies of the Charter and its bylaws, in each case as amended to the
date of this Agreement. The Charter and bylaws of the Company are in full
force and effect and the Company is not in violation of any provision of such
documents.

  

(b) Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each Subsidiary of

organization or incorporation. The Company has made available to Acquiror or
its advisors complete and correct copies of the Charter and Bylaws (or other
comparable charter or organizational documents) of the Company Subsidiaries,
in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement and each such document

and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except in the case of any Company Subsidiary
where the failure to have such power and authority would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(d) Except for interests in the Company Subsidiaries and except as otherwise
set forth in Section 3.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns directly or indirectly any interest
or investment (whether equity or debt) in any Person.

SECTION 5.2. _No Solicitation._

  

(a) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, the Company will, and

negotiations with any parties relating to an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly request that each Person (other than the Acquiror) who
has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company prior to date
hereof in connection with that Persons consideration of an Acquisition
Proposal within the past twelve months return or destroy all non-public
information furnished to that Person by or on behalf of the Company in
accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement. The
Company shall take reasonable steps to promptly inform its representatives of
the Companys obligations under this Section 5.2(a) and to instruct its
representatives to notify the Company as promptly as practicable following
the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal.

  

(b) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any Company Subsidiary to, nor
shall it authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of, or any

initiate or knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate (including
by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the implementation or
submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information
in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, prior to the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by
the Company stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof) from furnishing information to, or
engaging in negotiations or discussions with, any person in connection with
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such person, if and
only to the extent that (A) prior to taking such action the Board of
Directors (or such committee) determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside counsel, that the directors are required to do so in order
to comply with their duties to the Company and its stockholders under
applicable Law, **** and (B) the Company has (1) caused such person to enter
into a confidentiality agreement with the Company containing terms and
conditions regarding the non-disclosure and non-use of confidential
information that are substantially the same as those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (2) concurrently discloses the same such non-
public information to the Acquiror if not previously disclosed.

       

(c) The Company shall notify the Acquiror in writing promptly (but in any
event within 48 hours) upon receipt by the Company of (i) an Acquisition
Proposal or an indication by any Person that it intends to make an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for nonpublic information relating
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide
the Acquiror promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) in writing with the
identity of such person and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, indication,
inquiry or request, including any modifications thereto (or, where no such
copy is available, a description of such Acquisition Proposal, indication,
inquiry or request). The Company shall keep the Acquiror reasonably informed
on a prompt basis of the status of any Acquisition Proposal, indication,
inquiry or request, and any related communications to or by the Company or
its representatives (the Company agreeing that it shall not, and it shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which
prohibits the Company from providing such information to the Acquiror). The
Company shall not, and shall not cause any Company Subsidiary to, terminate,
waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill or
confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party and the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement.

  

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2, neither the Board or Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, in
a manner adverse to Acquiror or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation
of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
by the Board of Directors; (ii) approve or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) approve or enter into any letter of intent, acquisition
agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.2(b)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger by the Company stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and subject to the Companys compliance with this
Section 5.2, in response to the receipt of an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal, the Board of Directors may withdraw or modify the approval or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby (such event, a **" Change in Board Recommendation"**) if
(A) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consulting with its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such actions are
necessary to comply with the directors duties to the Company and its
stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws; (B) the Company has
notified the Acquiror in writing that it intends to effect a Change in Board
Recommendation, attaching to such notice the terms and conditions of such
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person or group making
the Acquisition Proposal and copies of any agreements and documents relating
to such Acquisition Proposal that have been received by the Company,
including, any definitive agreement relating to such Acquisition Proposal, if
available; and (C) during the three business day period following the
Acquirors receipt of such notice, (1) the Company shall have offered to
negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall
have caused its respective financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate
with (and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), the Acquiror in
making adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company to proceed with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (2) the Acquiror shall be entitled to deliver
to the Company a counterproposal to such Acquisition Proposal (a
**"Counterproposal"** ), and (3) if the Acquiror delivers a Counterproposal
pursuant to the preceding clause (2), then the Companys Board of Directors
shall have determined in good faith, after the end of such three business day
period, and consultation with its financial advisors, that the Acquisition
Proposal is more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the
Counterproposal (taking into account all financial and strategic conditions,
including the conditions, prospects and timing for completion of the
proposals). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
amendment to

       

any material term of an Acquisition Proposal subject to the procedures in
this Section 5.2(d) shall be treated as a new Acquisition Proposal for the
purposes of this Section 5.2(d) (for example, a new written notice by the
Company and a new three business day period is required).

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to the Company stockholders if the Board of Directors (or
any committee thereof) of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is required to do so
under applicable Law; provided, however, that neither the Company nor its
Board of Directors shall (i) recommend that the stockholders of the Company
tender any securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or
otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or (ii)
withdraw, modify or amend the recommendation of the Merger and this
Agreement, unless in each case, the requirements of Section 5.2(d) have been
satisfied.

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

(i) **"Acquisition Proposal"** means any proposal or offer (including any

Acquiror or Merger Sub relating to any (A) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (B) sale, lease (other than in the

securities representing 15% or more of the voting power of the capital stock
of the Company, (D) tender offer or exchange offer in which any Person or

Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of 15% or more
of the voting power of the capital stock of the Company or (E)
recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
type of transaction with respect to the Company, and in each case, including
any series of related transactions. The events described in any of clauses
(A) through (E) are referred to herein as an **"Acquisition"**.

  

(ii) **" Superior Proposal"** means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal not solicited or initiated in violation of Section 5.2(b) that (i)
relates to more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or

as a whole and (ii) is on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of its
financial advisor and after taking into account all the terms and conditions
of the Acquisition Proposal) are more favorable to the Companys stockholders
from a financial point of view than those contemplated by this Agreement
(including any alterations to this Agreement agreed to in writing by the
Company in response thereto).

Subsidiaries or their respective businesses prior to the Effective Time.

  

(b) Each party shall notify the other promptly of (i) any communication from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response thereto), (ii) any communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (and the response thereto) or (iii) any material legal actions
threatened or commenced against or otherwise affecting any of the parties
that are related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
and the Acquiror each shall promptly prepare and file any filings (in
addition to those described in Section 6.1) required under the Exchange Act
or any other federal, state or foreign Law relating to the Merger
(collectively, the **"Other Filings"** ). The Company and the Acquiror
shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of
all such Other Filings, including by providing copies of all relevant
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to the filing.
Neither the Company nor the Acquiror shall consent to any voluntary extension
of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each of the Company
and the Acquiror shall promptly notify the other of the receipt of any
comments on, or any request for amendments or supplements to, any of the
Other Filings by the SEC or any other Governmental Authority or official, and
each of the Company and the Acquiror shall supply the other with copies of
all correspondence between it and each of its subsidiaries and
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the members of its staff or
any other appropriate governmental official, on the other hand, with respect
to any of the Other Filings. The Company and the Acquiror each shall promptly

       

obtain and furnish the other (i) the information which may be reasonably
required in order to make such Other Filings and (ii) any additional
information which may be requested by a Governmental Authority and which the
parties reasonably deem appropriate.

  

(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall request an estoppel certificate and subordination and nondisturbance
agreements, in the form provided by Acquiror, from those tenants under any
lease in excess of 5,000 square feet with respect to a Company Property
identified by Acquiror. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain such estoppel certificates prior to the Effective Time.

  

SECTION 6.5. _Company Benefit Plans._

  

(a) Acquiror hereby agrees to the following provisions:

  

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will terminate the employment of
each of the employees of the Company identified by Acquiror (unless such
employees employment has previously been terminated for any reason).

  

(ii) At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall offer employment with the
Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate of Acquiror to all employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (other than those terminated pursuant to
clause (i) above). Any offer of employment shall be subject to Acquirors or
such Affiliates policies and procedures on background checks and
confirmation of immigration status of each such employee. Such employment
shall be on an at-will basis.

  

(iii) Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
applicable Affiliate of Acquiror who employs the employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to, assume all liabilities under the Company Benefit
Plans, and under all policies, agreements, programs and plans described in
Section 6.5(c) below.

  

(iv) For a period of at least two years after the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of the Acquiror to, provide to all
individuals who are employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and their eligible beneficiaries
(the **"Covered Persons"** ) with medical, dental and vision benefits (the
**"Covered Benefits"** ) on terms that are no less favorable in any respect
to the medical, dental and vision benefits provided to such Covered Persons
by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Covered Benefits
shall be provided to the Covered Persons at Acquirors sole expense, and
shall continue to be provided pursuant to this Section 6.5(a)(iv)
regardless of whether such Covered Persons subsequently become eligible for
medical, dental or vision insurance from another employer. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Section 6.5(a)(iv) to the contrary, any Covered Person
who becomes actively employed by the Acquiror or any Affiliate of the
Acquiror (other than the Company) following the Effective Time (a
**"Transferred Employee"** ) shall no longer be entitled to the Covered
Benefits as described in the preceding two sentences, but shall be entitled
to participate in the medical, dental and vision plans, programs and
arrangements (if any) of the Acquiror or any Affiliate of the Acquiror (other
than the Company) (the **"Acquiror Plans"** ) that actively employs such
Transferred Employee pursuant to the terms of such Acquiror Plans.

  

(b) All service credited to each employee by the Company through the
Effective Time shall be recognized by Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and
the applicable Affiliate of Acquiror for all purposes, including for purposes
of eligibility, vesting, benefit accruals (but excluding benefit accrual
under any defined benefit plan) and level of benefits under any employee
benefit plan provided by Acquiror or each applicable Affiliate of Acquiror
for the benefit of such employees. With respect to any welfare benefit plan
established or maintained by Acquiror or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries for
the benefit of employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and their
eligible dependents, Acquiror shall, or shall cause the relevant Affiliate or
Subsidiary to, waive any pre-existing condition exclusions, eligibility
waiting periods,

       

and evidence of insurability requirements (to the same extent such
limitations, waiting periods, or evidence of insurability requirements would
not have applied under the relevant Company Benefit Plan) and provide that
any covered expenses incurred on or before the Effective Time in respect of
the current plan year by any employee of the Company (or any covered
dependent of such an employee) shall be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, offset, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket provisions (or similar payments or limitations) after the Effective
Time in respect of such current plan year.

  

(c) Acquiror hereby agrees, and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and
each applicable Affiliate of Acquiror, to honor (without modification) and
assume the severance policies, employment agreements, and retention
agreements listed in Section 3.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

SECTION 6.6. _Indemnification and Insurance._

  

(a) Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation agree that the indemnification
obligations and limitations of liability set forth in Article VI, Section 5
and Article IX of the Charter, and Article XII of the Companys bylaws, in
each case as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six
years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time
were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries.

  

(b) The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law
indemnify and hold harmless, and, after the Effective Time, Acquiror and the
Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director or officer
of the Company and of each Company Subsidiary and each such person who served
at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director,
officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, the **" Indemnified Parties"**)
against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts
paid in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil,
administrative or investigative (each a **"Legal Action"** ), arising out of
or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as a director or
officer, in each case occurring on or before the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, (i) the Company or Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel
selected by any Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company or to Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation and
consistent with any applicable directors and officers insurance policy, as
the case may be, promptly after statements therefor are received and (ii) the
Company and Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; _provided, however_ , that neither the Company
nor Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); _provided, further_ , that none of the Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated under this Section 6.6(b) to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (chosen by a plurality of the
applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single or consolidated Legal Action or Legal
Actions except to the extent that an Indemnified Party shall have interests
in the outcome of such action that conflict with the interests of other
Indemnified Parties in the outcome of such action in which case such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to separate counsel; and _provided,
further_ , that the Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall have no
obligation hereunder to advance fees or expenses to any Indemnified Party
unless the Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation receive an undertaking by
or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay any advanced fees and
expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Law that such
Indemnified Party was not entitled to be indemnified. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.6(b) in respect

       

of a Legal Action, shall notify the Company or the Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, in writing thereof upon learning of the Legal
Action; _provided, however_ , that the failure to so notify shall not affect
the obligations under this Section 6.6(b) of the Company or the Acquiror and
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, except to the extent such failure
to notify materially prejudices such party.

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a "tail"
insurance policy with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance for claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time,
in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies;
_provided, however,_ that in no event shall the aggregate premium payable for
such "tail" insurance policies exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid by
the Company for such insurance (such 300% **** amount being the **"Maximum
Premium"** ). The Company agrees to consult with the Acquiror in connection
with purchasing such insurance coverage. If the Company is unable to obtain
the "tail" insurance described in the first sentence of this Section 6.6(c)
for an amount equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Company shall
be entitled to obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as possible for
an amount equal to the Maximum Premium. The Company represents that
such current annual premium amount with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance is set forth in Section 6.6(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

(d) In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person or shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

  

(e) The obligations of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, and Acquiror
under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any director or officer to whom this Section 6.6
applies without the consent of such affected director or officer persons (it
being expressly agreed that each such director or officer to whom this
Section 6.6 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6).

  

SECTION 6.7. _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Acquiror shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

  

SECTION 6.8. _Public Announcements._ Acquiror and the Company shall each
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior written consent of the other
party, which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided,
however, that a party may, without the prior written consent of the other
party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be
required by Law or any listing agreement with any applicable stock exchange
if the party issuing such press release or making such public statement has
used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party and to
obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner.

  

SECTION 6.9. _Transfer and Gains Taxes._ Acquiror and the Company will
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and
stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and
any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related
interests, penalties or additions to Tax, **" Transfer and Gains Taxes"**).
From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will pay or
cause to be paid, all Transfer and Gains Taxes.

       

SECTION 6.10. _REIT Status._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company
or Acquiror from taking, and the Company and Acquiror hereby
agree, respectively, to take any action at any time or from time to time that
in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company or Board
of Directors of Acquiror, as the case may be, upon advice of counsel, is
legally necessary for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT or
to eliminate or reduce income or excise taxes under Sections 856, 857, 860
and 4981 of the Code (and similar provisions of state or local Tax Law) for
any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Effective Time,
including making dividend or distribution payments to stockholders of the
Company; _provided_ that (a) the Company is not presently aware of any action
that is currently legally necessary to be taken for the Company to maintain
its qualification as a REIT or to eliminate or reduce income or excise taxes
under Sections 856, 857, 860 and 4981 of the Code (and similar provisions of
state or local Tax Law) that would constitute, or would be reasonably
likely to constitute, a breach of this Agreement and (b) prior notice is
given to the Acquiror of any actions that will otherwise constitute a breach
of this Agreement. Following the Merger, Acquiror shall use its best efforts
to take any such actions as may be necessary to maintain the Companys status
as a REIT for any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the
Effective Time (including the mailing of stockholder demand letters as
required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.857-8).

  

SECTION 6.11. _Company Common Stock Ownership Limitations._ The Company
shall take all action necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not result in any violation of the Company Common
Stock ownership limitations set forth in Article VII of the Charter.

  

SECTION 6.12. _Resignations._ Prior to or contemporaneously with
the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each of its directors and officers, and each of the directors, officers
and managers of the Company Subsidiaries (and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any director of any of the Companys special
purpose entities), to submit his or her resignation from such position(s) and
execute and deliver a release in the form of the applicable release set forth
on Schedule 1 hereto, effective as of the Effective Time; provided, however,
that by resigning such officers and directors will not lose the benefit of
any "change of control" provisions of any employment agreement or other
instruments to which they would otherwise be entitled.

  

SECTION 6.13. _Use of "Bedford" Name._ Each of the Company, the Acquiror
and the Merger Sub, agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (excluding
Peter Bedford in the case of the Company), not to use the "Bedford" name for
any purposes (including the conduct of the business in the ordinary course)
after the Closing. The parties agree and acknowledge that Peter Bedford is a
third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.13.

other than the provisions of Section 6.3(b), 6.8, this Section 8.2, Section

set forth in this Agreement.

  

SECTION 8.3. _Fees and Expenses._

  

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.3, all Expenses incurred

pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i) or 8.1(f)(iii) and

       

(B) an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced prior to such
termination and within 12 months following such termination an Acquisition of

event later than two (2) business days) after the consummation of such
Acquisition or the entry into such definitive agreement; (ii) by Acquiror
pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(ii), then the Company shall pay Acquiror the

time of such termination) the Acquiror shall pay the Company the
reasonable documented Expenses of the Company, up to an aggregate maximum
amount of $3.5 million, promptly (but in no event later than two (2) business
days) after such termination.

  

(e) In the event that the Company is obligated to pay the Company Termination
Fee set forth in Section 8.3(b) or the Expenses set forth in Section 8.3(c)
(the  **"Termination Payment"** ), the Company shall pay to Acquiror from
the Termination Payment deposited into escrow in accordance with the next
sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Termination Payment or
(ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to Acquiror without
causing Acquiror to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)(I) of
the Code ( **"Qualifying Income"** ), as determined by Acquirors independent
certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event Acquiror receives either
(A) a letter from Acquirors counsel indicating that Acquiror has received a
ruling from the IRS described in Section 8.3(f) or (B) an opinion from
Acquirors outside counsel as described in Section 8.3(f), an amount equal to
the Termination Payment less the amount payable under clause (1) above. To
secure the Companys obligation to pay these amounts, the Company shall
deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Termination Payment with
an escrow agent selected by Acquiror and on such terms (subject to Section
8.3(f)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Acquiror and the
escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment
pursuant to this Section 8.3(e) shall be made at the time the Company is
obligated to pay Acquiror such amount pursuant to Section 8.3(b)
and/or Section 8.3(c), as applicable, by wire transfer or bank check.

  

(f) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment in escrow
or any portion thereof shall not be released to Acquiror unless the escrow
agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from
Acquirors independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Acquiror without causing
Acquiror to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from Acquirors accountants revising
that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to
Acquiror, or (ii) a letter from Acquirors counsel indicating that Acquiror
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Acquiror of the

       

Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code (or alternatively, Acquirors outside counsel has rendered a
legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Acquiror of the Termination
Payment would constitute Qualifying Income, would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would
not otherwise disqualify Acquiror as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent
shall release the remainder of the Termination Payment to Acquiror. The
Company agrees to amend this Section 8.3 at the request of Acquiror in order
to (A) maximize the portion of the Termination Payment that may be
distributed to Acquiror hereunder without causing Acquiror to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (B) improve
Acquirors chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section
8.3(f) or (C) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from
its outside counsel as described in this Section 8.3(f); provided that in
each case the obligations of the Company shall be limited to such amendments
as shall not be adverse in any manner to the Company and its stockholders.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Company agrees that maximizing distributions
to Acquiror under clause (A) or improving Acquirors chances of securing a
favorable ruling under clause (B) shall not, in and of themselves, be treated
as adverse to the Company or its stockholders for purposes of the proviso in
the preceding sentence.

  

(g) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, if any party fails to pay to another party hereto any amounts due
under this Section 8.3, the failing party shall pay the costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action,
including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect
payment.

  

SECTION 8.4. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties at
any time before or after any required approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that after any such approval,
there shall not be made any amendment that by law requires further approval
by such stockholders without the further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties.

  

SECTION 8.5. _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in any instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.

SECTION 9.8. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement

with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly

prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and/or any Company
Subsidiary and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court of the United States located in the State of
California or in California state court, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity. The parties acknowledge
that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be for damages as set
forth in the following sentence and the Guarantee; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent
any breach by Acquiror of Section 6.3(b), 6.8 or 6.13. The Company agrees

damages in connection with this Agreement the maximum aggregate liability of
Acquiror, Merger Sub and Guarantor for such losses or damages shall be
limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Guarantee, and in no event
shall the Company or the Company Subsidiaries seek to recover any money
damages in excess of such amount from Acquiror, Merger Sub or Guarantor or
their respective representatives and Affiliates in connection therewith. In
addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of California
or any California state court in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a federal
or state court sitting in the State of California.

       

SECTION 9.9. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies
that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that
it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, as applicable, by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.9.

  

SECTION 9.10. _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties._
Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that,

Agreement (a) no party makes, and has not made, any representations or
warranties relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) no person has been authorized
by any party to make any representation or warranty relating itself or its
businesses or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and, if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon
as having been authorized by such party, and (c) any estimates, projections,
predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any
other materials or information provided or addressed to any party or any of
its representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include
representations or warranties unless any such materials or information is the
subject of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement.

  

SECTION 9.11. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
