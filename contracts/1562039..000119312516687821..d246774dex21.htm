ARTICLE 2

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively, the "
_Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_ ") outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, but excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares,
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $48.53 per Share in
cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. All Shares that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in this Section 2.1(a) shall be automatically cancelled upon the conversion
thereof and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest.

(b)  _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Share that is owned by the Company as
treasury stock or otherwise, or by Parent or Merger Sub, or by any Subsidiary
of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) _Dissenters Â’ Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders
of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal

 



-3-  rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with,
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any such Shares held by any such
holder (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such
Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall
remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. At the
Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL
and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or settle any such demands.

 

(e) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period (but excluding the
effect of any exercise of Company Options that are outstanding as of the date
of this Agreement), the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication,
to proportionally reflect such change.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall
be appointed by Parent (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as
a paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares), payable upon
due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this
Article 2 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
").

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date,
Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to

 



-4-  Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as is customary, and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration.

 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
from the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holderÂ’s properly
surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding Taxes). No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable.

(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
agents, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

(c)  _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
transfer or any other reason, the holder of any such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in
Section 2.2(b) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter
of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Article 2\.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares on the six month anniversary of
the Effective Time shall thereafter be delivered to the Surviving Corporation
upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their
Shares in accordance with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

 



-5- (e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government, or any U.S. registered open
end investment company holding itself out as a U.S. government money market
fund. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding
Taxes), without any interest thereon.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

(a) Each option to purchase Shares that was granted pursuant to any Company
Benefit Plan (each, a " _Company Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective
Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company Option and
(ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
pay to the holders of Company Options the cash amounts described in the
immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within five
calendar days following the Effective Time. If the applicable exercise price
per Share equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company Option
shall be cancelled without payment of additional consideration, and all
rights with respect to such Company Option shall terminate as of the Effective
Time.

(b) Each award of restricted stock units granted pursuant to any Company
Benefit Plan (each, an " _RSU_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall as of the Effective
Time, become fully vested (in the case of Company RSUs that are Market Share
Unit Awards (" _MSUs_ "), in respect of a number of Shares determined pursuant
to the terms of the applicable award agreement with respect to performance 

 



-6-  determination in connection with a "change in control") and be cancelled and
of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time and automatically
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Shares subject to such RSU and (ii) the Merger
Consideration. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay to the holders of RSUs the cash amounts
described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within
five calendar days following the Effective Time (or such later date as is
required by Section 409A of the Code).

(c) Each Share granted subject to any vesting or other lapse restrictions
pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan (each, a " _Restricted Share_ "), whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, at the Effective Time, become fully vested (without regard to
the satisfaction of any performance condition, vesting or other lapse
condition) and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the Merger Consideration. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay to the holders of Restricted
Shares the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment, within five calendar days following the Effective Time.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, through its Board of Directors
or an appropriate committee thereof, will adopt such resolutions as may
reasonably be required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section
2.3.

Section 2.4 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all
necessary action to ensure that no new offering periods under the CompanyÂ’s
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") will commence during the period
from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time. The accumulated
contributions of the participants in the current offering period shall be used
to purchase Shares as of no later than ten Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, and the participantsÂ’ purchase rights under such offerings
shall terminate immediately after such purchase. As of no later than the
Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
terminate the ESPP.

above, and thereafter the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to
cause such access or information to be provided in a manner that would not

violate the applicable restriction); _provided_ , _further_ , that any
access or investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall be conducted in
a manner so as to not interfere unreasonably with the business and operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Parent hereby agrees that all nonpublic information provided to it or any
of its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be Confidential
Information, as such term is used in, and shall be treated in accordance with,

_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

Section 5.5 _No Solicitation_.

the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 7, the Company agrees that it shall not and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate,

Proposal, (B) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an

into any letter of intent, agreement, contract or agreement in principle

the terms of this Agreement).

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.5, neither the Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Recommendation, (ii) subject to
Section 5.5(f) (and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any "stop, look and
listen" statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act), take any formal action or make any public statement in connection with
a tender offer or

 



-32-  exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or a
reaffirmation of the Recommendation, (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company, an
Alternative Proposal, or (iv) fail to include the Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (any action described in clauses (i)-(iv) being referred to as a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, a
material development or material change in circumstances (other than relating
to or in connection with an Alternative Proposal) occurs or arises after the
date of this Agreement that was not known and not reasonably foreseeable (or
if known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable)
by the Board of Directors as of the date of this Agreement (any such
development or change being a " _Material Development_ "), the Board of
Directors may make a Change of Recommendation under clauses (i) or (iv) of
Section 5.5(b) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the Board of DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary duties to the

Company (A) has given Parent at least four Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such action and specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action, (B) has given Parent during
such four-Business Day period the opportunity to meet or negotiate with the

Company to discuss or negotiate in good faith a modification of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (C) at the end of such four-Business Day
period, after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement
committed to in writing by Parent, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure of the Board of Directors to make such Change of Recommendation would
continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law.

(d) The Company shall promptly (within 24 hours) notify Parent in the event
that the Company, its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives, after the date
hereof, any request for discussions or negotiations with respect to an
Alternative Proposal or proposal that is reasonably likely to lead to
an Alternative Proposal, any request for access to the properties or books
and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives is or has
become aware, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, by any third party that is
considering making, or has made, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to
Parent shall indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal or
request and the material terms and conditions of such proposal, if any,
communicated by such Person to the Company.

 

(e) Anything in this Section 5.5 to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:

 

(i) if the Company receives an unsolicited, written Alternative Proposal
without any material violation of this Section 5.5 that the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, is or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (A) furnish
nonpublic information to the third party making such

 



-33-  Alternative Proposal, if, prior to so furnishing such information, the
Company receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement
having provisions as to confidential treatment of information that are
substantially similar to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , that
any material nonpublic information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
that is provided or made available by the Company to a third party given such
access that was not previously provided or made available to Parent or its
Representatives shall be provided to Parent substantially concurrently, if
such information is written, or otherwise promptly thereafter (and in any
event within 24 hours); and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the
third party with respect to the Alternative Proposal; _provided_ , that the
Company shall provide to Parent a copy of any written Alternative Proposal
made after the date hereof to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by such
third party and the identity of such third party; and

 

(ii) the Board of Directors may make a Change of Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, but only if prior to taking any such action:

(1) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative
Proposal is a Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustment or
revisions committed to in writing by Parent in response to such Alternative
Proposal (including pursuant to clause (3) below));

(2) the Company (A) at least four Business Days in advance of taking such
action (the " _Notice Period_ "), has given Parent prior written notice of its
intention to terminate this Agreement and has provided to Parent a copy of
such Superior Proposal and (B) has given Parent during the Notice Period the
opportunity to meet or negotiate with the Board of Directors and its outside
legal counsel to enable Parent and the Company to discuss or negotiate in good
faith a modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

(3) at the end of the Notice Period, the Board of Directors, after
consultation with the CompanyÂ’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
shall have determined in good faith that the third partyÂ’s Alternative
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal (taking into account any amendments to
this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent); _provided_ , that each
time material modifications to the material terms of an Alternative Proposal
determined to be a Superior Proposal are made, a new written notification from
the Company consistent with that described in clause (ii)(2) of this Section
5.5(e) shall be required and a new Notice Period under clause (ii)(2) of this
Section 5.5(e) shall commence, during which notice period the Company shall be
required to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.5(e)(ii) anew,
except that such new Notice Period shall be for two Business Days (as opposed
to four Business Days).

 



-34- (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder; or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ exercise of their
fiduciary duties to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Law.

(g) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer
made by any Person for (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,

assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis or (iii)
the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the voting power of the outstanding Shares of Common Stock, including
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person beneficially owning Shares with fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, in each case of
clauses (i)-(iii), other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, written Alternative
Proposal, without any violation of this Section 5.5, substituting "fifty

consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and taking
into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of the
Alternative Proposal, (i) would be, if consummated, more favorable to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders from a financial point of view than this Agreement and
the Merger (after taking into account any modifications or changes committed
to in writing by Parent pursuant to clause (e)(ii) above) and (ii) is
reasonably likely to be consummated if accepted (including, without
limitation, that any necessary financing is reasonably likely to be obtained
on a timely basis).

consultation with Parent and giving due consideration to any comments made by
Parent) and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to

access under Section 5.4(a)). If at any time prior to the Company Meeting any
information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the Company or Parent
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement (or any other filings) shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the

time to time.

Agreement and the Merger to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders at the Company Meeting
whether or not a Change of Recommendation shall have occurred.

combination" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub and the members of their respective Boards of Directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary

practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other reasonably informed
of, and cooperate with such party in connection with, any stockholder

of the Company Disclosure Letter, from the Effective Time until April 29,
2018, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each
Company Employee who is eligible under the CST Brands, Inc. Severance Plan
effective as of February 25, 2016 (a copy of which is set forth in Section 5.9
of the Company Disclosure Letter, the " _Severance Plan_ ") as of the
Effective Time, severance benefits equal to the greater of (I) the severance
benefits to which such Company Employee is then entitled under the Severance
Plan as described in Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter, taking into
account all service whether before or after the Effective Time, and (II) the
severance benefits provided to employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries who
are similarly situated to (including with respect to work location) the
applicable Company Employee under the severance arrangements of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, in each case without duplication of benefits under any other
Contract or arrangement applicable to such Company Employee and without taking
into account any reduction after the Effective Time in base compensation paid
to such Company Employee.

 



-37- (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting (other than equity
awards), eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee
benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company
Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply (i) with respect to participation in or
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension or retiree medical plan or
(ii) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits.

 

(c) In addition, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and  _further_ _provided_ that the
foregoing provision shall not preclude the Parent from confirming the
eligibility of any such employee or his or her covered dependents after the
Effective Time, and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent
shall cause (A) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the amount of
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
which were credited to deductible and maximum out-of-pocket co-insurance
requirements under the Old Plans to be credited for purposes of satisfying the
deductible, and maximum out-of-pocket co-insurance requirements under the New
Plans.

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.10, the provisions of this
Section 5.9 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former director, officer, employee, other service provider or
independent contractor or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary
of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to
any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement
for any purpose or to confer upon any Company Employee any right to continued
employment. Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall supersede or conflict with any
Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 



-38- Section 5.10 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Each of the parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to promptly do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event
prior to the End Date, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, from Governmental Entities and the making of
all necessary registrations and filings in connection therewith, (ii) using
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, and (iii) subject to Section 5.7(b),
the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company, Parent or Merger

other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any contract or agreement.

(b) Parent and the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than 20
Business Days after the date hereof, file (or cause to be filed) any and all
required pre-merger notification and report forms under the HSR Act and the
Competition Act with respect to the Merger. Parent and the Company shall
request early termination of any applicable waiting periods under such
Antitrust Laws and shall respectively use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the expiration or termination of such waiting periods, and
shall supply to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice (" _Antitrust Division_ ") or the United States Federal Trade
Commission (" _FTC_ ") or to the Canadian Competition Bureau (the "
_Competition Bureau_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information or documents that may be requested pursuant to any Law or by any
of them.

(c) In furtherance of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section
5.10, but subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.10(d), (i) if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a
private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the parties hereto shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction, or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that results from such action or proceeding and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger on or before the End Date
and (ii) Parent shall take all such further action as may be necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law so as to
enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event no
later than the End Date), and including, in the case of Parent, proposing,
negotiating, committing and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order,
or otherwise, to (i) sell, divest, dispose of or otherwise hold separate
(including by establishing a trust or otherwise), any of the businesses,
assets or properties of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates and (ii) otherwise take or commit to take
actions that after the Closing would limit ParentÂ’s freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to operate and/or retain any of the businesses,
assets or properties of

 



-39-  Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates (the actions described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being
" _Divestiture Actions_ "); _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to become subject to, or consent or agree
to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order to sell, divest, license, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets, operations or business of the Company or any of its
Affiliates, unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or
order is binding on or otherwise applicable to the Company only from and after
the Effective Time in the event that the Closing occurs.

 

(d) Parent shall have the right (subject to compliance with Section 5.10(e)
and its other obligations under this Section 5.10) to determine, direct and
have control over the strategy and process by which the parties will seek
required approvals under the Antitrust Laws and to control the defense or
prosecution of any claims, actions or proceedings relating thereto,
including all matters relating to any Divestiture Actions.

(e) Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all filings, notifications, communications,
submissions, and any other actions pursuant to this Section 5.10, and, subject
to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised on a current
basis of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by Parent and the Company, as the
case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, from any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions.
Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Parent and
the Company shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any material proposed notifications or filings and any
material written communications or submissions to any Governmental Entity;
_provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the businesses of Parent, the Company
or their respective Subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties with
respect thereto, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual agreements, and
(iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality
concerns. Parent and the Company agree not to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with
the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party a reasonable opportunity to attend
and participate.

Section 5.11  _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume the obligations with respect to all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of
expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or any indemnification contract between such directors
or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date
hereof), without further action, as of the Effective Time and all such
obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.

 



-40- (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the CompanyÂ’s and
any Company SubsidiaryÂ’s certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors or officers as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former
directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;  _provided_
, _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any action
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim, even if
beyond such six-year period. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.11.

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing) each current and former director or officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served at the request of the Company
as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (each, together with such PersonÂ’s heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
(collectively, " _Losses_ ") in connection with any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to
or in connection with any act or omission occurring or alleged to
have occurred, whether before or after the Effective Time, in connection with
such Indemnified PartyÂ’s service as a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including acts or omissions in connection with such
Indemnified PartyÂ’s service as an officer, director, member, trustee or other
fiduciary of any other enterprise if such service was at the request of the
Company); _provided_ , that (i) any Person to whom any funds are advanced
pursuant to the foregoing must provide an undertaking to repay such advances
if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification, (ii) all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action
pending or asserted within such period shall continue until the disposition
of such Action and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without ParentÂ’s or the Surviving
CorporationÂ’s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event of any such Action, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense thereof.

 



-41- (d) Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to purchase a six-year prepaid
"tail" policy, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the CompanyÂ’s and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ existing policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions or actions contemplated by this Agreement), and Parent
shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase
or pay for insurance hereunder. If Parent for any reason fails to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a period
of six years after the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage
required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The
provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly
reimburse each Indemnified Party for any costs or expenses (including
attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred by any such Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnification or other obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation in
this Section 5.11 (including Section 5.11(c)) unless it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to the benefit of such
indemnification or other obligation.

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.11.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.11, except the first sentence of Section 5.11(b) and Section 5.11(f)
(solely as such Section 5.11(f) relates to the first sentence of Section
5.11(b)), shall be applicable to CrossAmerica GP LLC, CAPL or any of the CAPL
Subsidiaries.

 



-42- Section 5.12 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall take, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause to be done, all things necessary to obtain the debt financing
necessary to pay in cash the aggregate Merger Consideration and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ "). Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to obtain
the Debt Financing or any alternative Debt Financing.

 

(b) Upon the request of Parent, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such assistance with respect to the
Debt Financing as is reasonably requested by Parent, including: (a) making
available at mutually agreed times to prospective lenders, on a customary and
reasonable basis and upon reasonable notice, appropriate personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) providing, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, customary information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to any financing institutions contemplated to arrange and/or
provide all or any portion of the Debt Financing (the " _Financing Sources_
") (including information to be used in the preparation of a customary
information package regarding the business, operations and financial condition
of Parent and its Subsidiaries customary for financings similar to the Debt
Financing) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent and/or the Financing
Sources to assist in preparation of customary offering or information
documents to be used for the completion of the Debt Financing, (c)
assisting in obtaining customary payoff letters and instruments of discharge
to be delivered at Closing to the extent that Parent determines to arrange for
the payoff of all or any part of the CompanyÂ’s existing credit facilities and
releasing Liens and the pledges of collateral securing such facilities, in
each case to take effect at the Effective Time (it being understood that the
Company shall have no obligation to pay or discharge any such indebtedness
prior to the Effective Time or deliver any notice of termination, prepayment
or redemption prior to the Effective Time that is not conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing), and (d) assisting Parent in obtaining customary
comfort letters and consents of the independent accountants of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Anything in this Section 5.12 or this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, until the Effective Time occurs, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers
or directors, as the case may be, shall be required to (i) waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
reimburse any expenses for which it has not received prior reimbursement, (ii)
take any action or provide any assistance that would reasonably be expected
to interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (iii) take any action or provide any information that will
conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any applicable Laws
or would result in a breach of, or default under, any contractual arrangement
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or would result in
the waiver of legal privilege, (iv) give any indemnities in connection with
the Debt Financing, (v) pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize
the execution of the Debt Financing or any definitive agreements with respect
thereto, (vi) enter into any definitive agreement or have any liability or
any obligation under any certificate, document, instrument, credit agreement
or any related document or any other agreement or document related to the Debt
Financing, or (vii) take any action in his/her capacity as a director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including the delivery of any certificate
or opinion, with respect to any Debt Financing. Upon request by the Company
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out of pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives in connection with the Debt Financing, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless

 



-43-  the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all damages, losses, costs, liabilities or expenses suffered
or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing, any information used in connection therewith (other than
information provided in writing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) and
all other actions taken by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives in connection with the Debt Financing. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, their obligations hereunder,
including their obligation to consummate the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby, are not subject to, or conditioned on, the receipt of the
Debt Financing.

 

Section 5.13 _Public Announcements_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
or anyone acting on their behalf, shall issue any press release or other
public statement or comment relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required
by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any securities exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Entity (in
which case, the party issuing the press release, public statement or comment
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to give the other party the
opportunity to review and comment upon such press release or other public
statement or comment prior to issuance); _provided_ that the restrictions in
this Section 5.13 shall not apply to any Company communication regarding an
Alternative Proposal or a Change of Recommendation permitted by Section 5.5.
Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press release or separate press
releases announcing this Agreement, in either case in a form(s) to be
mutually agreed upon by the parties.

Section 5.14 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.15 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the

former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders,
managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives and none of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future

parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7.3 do not constitute a penalty.

reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
