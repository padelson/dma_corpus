AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 22,
2014, between INTEGRYS ENERGY GROUP, INC., a Wisconsin corporation (the "
_Company_ ") and WISCONSIN ENERGY CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation ("

WHEREAS, within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, Parent will cause to
be formed two direct, wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent as Wisconsin
corporations (referred to as " _Merger Sub_ " and " _Subsequent Merger Sub_ "
and, collectively, the " _Merger Subsidiaries_ "), and cause the Merger
Subsidiaries to execute a joinder in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A to
become parties to this Agreement (a " _Joinder_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS the parties hereto intend that, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, (a) at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as
the surviving corporation (the " _Initial Merger_ ") and (b) immediately after
the Effective Time and without further approval, authorization or direction
from or by any of the parties hereto, through the binding commitment evidenced
by Section 1.07 and as part of an integrated plan with the Initial Merger, the
Initial Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Subsequent Merger Sub
(the " _Subsequent Merger_ " and, together with the Initial Merger, the "
_Mergers_ "), with Subsequent Merger Sub surviving the Subsequent Merger as
the Surviving Corporation;

 



 

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") and
the Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ "), by resolution, have
each approved this Agreement, and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub and the
Board of Directors of Subsequent Merger Sub, by resolution, will have each
approved this Agreement immediately prior to executing a Joinder;

 



 

WHEREAS the Company Board and the Parent Board have each determined that the
Initial Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, is in the best interests of the Company and Parent, as applicable,
and their respective shareholders, and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub
will have determined, immediately prior to executing a Joinder, that the

Agreement, is in the best interest of Merger Sub and its shareholder;

 



 

WHEREAS the Parent Board has determined that the Subsequent Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the
best interests of Parent and its shareholders, and the Board of Directors of
Subsequent Merger Sub will have determined, immediately prior to executing a
Joinder, that the Subsequent Merger, upon the terms and subject to the

WHEREAS the Company Board has resolved, and the Board of Directors of Merger
Sub and the Board of Directors of Subsequent Merger Sub, immediately prior to
executing a Joinder will have resolved, to recommend the approval of this
Agreement by their respective shareholders;

      
 

 



 

WHEREAS the Parent Board has resolved to recommend the approval by its
shareholders of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock and the
amendment to the Parent Articles contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS for U.S. Federal income tax purposes the Initial Merger and the
Subsequent Merger are intended to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment; and

 



 

WHEREAS the Company and Parent and, upon execution of a Joinder, Merger Sub
and Subsequent Merger Sub, each desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Mergers and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Mergers.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _The Mergers_

 



 

SECTION 1.01 _The Initial Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Wisconsin
Business Corporation Law (the " _WBCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company. At the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation in the Initial Merger (the " _Initial Surviving
Corporation_ ").

 



 

SECTION 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Initial Merger
shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP,
155 North Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606 at 10:00 a.m., Chicago time,
on the second Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
those conditions), or at such other place, time and date as may be agreed in
writing between the Company and Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all
the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII have not been satisfied or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waived on such second Business Day, then the Closing
shall take place on the first Business Day on which all such conditions have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived or at such other
time and date as may be agreed in writing between the Company and Parent. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

 



 

SECTION 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, in
connection with and as part of the Closing, the parties shall cause the
articles of merger relating to the Initial Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_
") to be delivered to the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of
Wisconsin in accordance with the relevant provisions of the WBCL, and, as soon
as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings

 



      
 

 



 

required under the WBCL or by the Department of Financial Institutions of the
State of Wisconsin in connection with the Initial Merger. The Initial Merger
shall become effective at the time that the Articles of Merger have been duly
filed with the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin,
or at such later date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Articles of Merger (the time the Initial Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

SECTION 1.04 _Effects_. The Initial Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the WBCL, including Section
180.1106(1) thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Initial Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Initial Surviving Corporation.

 



 

SECTION 1.05 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_. At the Effective Time,
(a) the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Initial
Surviving Corporation and (b) the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Initial
Surviving Corporation, in each case until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 6.04).

 



 

SECTION 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Initial Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Initial Surviving Corporation
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 



 

SECTION 1.07 _The Subsequent Merger_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the WBCL,
immediately after the Effective Time, the Initial Surviving Corporation shall
be merged with and into Subsequent Merger Sub. Upon the effectiveness of the
Subsequent Merger (the time of such effectiveness, the " _Subsequent Effective
Time_ "), the separate corporate existence of the Initial Surviving
Corporation shall cease and Subsequent Merger Sub shall continue as the
surviving corporation in the Subsequent Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_
").

 



 

(b) The Subsequent Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement
and in the applicable provisions of the WBCL, including Section 180.1106(l)
thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto,
at the Subsequent Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Initial Surviving Corporation and Subsequent
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Initial Surviving Corporation and Subsequent Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) At the Subsequent Effective Time, (i) the articles of incorporation of
Subsequent Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Subsequent
Effective Time and in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B shall be the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the by-laws of
Subsequent Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Subsequent
Effective Time and in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C shall be the by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 6.04).

 



 

(d) The directors and officers of Subsequent Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Subsequent Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified,
as the case may be.

 



 

SECTION 1.08 _Plan of Merger_. This Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
merger" with respect to each of the Mergers for purposes of the WBCL.

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

 



 

SECTION 2.01 _Effect of Initial Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Initial Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock or Merger Sub Common Stock:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock._ Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Initial Surviving Corporation
(" _Initial Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ ") with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Initial Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of Initial Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence until such
time as the Initial Surviving Corporation issues new certificates in respect
of such shares.

 



 

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of
common stock, par value $1.00, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ")
that is owned by the Company as treasury stock and each share of Company
Common Stock, if any, that is owned by Parent or the Merger Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
shares held by the Company Rabbi Trusts shall not be canceled pursuant to this
Section 2.01(b) but shall instead be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c).

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than

 



      
 

 



 

shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive (i)
$18.58 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) 1.128
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the common stock, par
value $0.01 (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), of Parent (the " _Stock
Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and each holder of shares of Company Common Stock held in
uncertificated book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, any declared dividends on
Company Common Stock with a record date prior to the Effective Time that
remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to such holder of Company
Common Stock and any other dividends or other distributions to which holders
of Company Common Stock become entitled upon the surrender of such Certificate
in accordance with Section 2.03, in the case of certificated shares, and upon
delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, without interest.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time or
(ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with ARTICLE VIII, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event occurs, then the
Merger Consideration and the Equity Award Consideration and any other number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event. As provided in Section 2.03(i), the right of any holder of Company
Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration or other consideration shall
be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding under applicable
Tax Law.

 



 

SECTION 2.02 _Effect of Subsequent Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Subsequent
Effective Time, all shares of common stock of the Initial Surviving
Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Subsequent

SECTION 2.03 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing
Date, Parent and the Company shall agree upon and appoint a bank or trust
company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of
the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) for exchange in
accordance with this ARTICLE II through the Exchange Agent, a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to issue the aggregate Stock
Consideration, (ii) cash in an

 



      
 

 



 

amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(c) and (iii) cash in an amount sufficient to make payments of cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(e). All such Parent Common
Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ". As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each registered holder of a
Certificate a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent may specify,
subject to the Companys prior approval), together with instructions thereto.

 



 

(b) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange._ Upon the
later of the Effective Time and the surrender of a Certificate for cancelation
to the Exchange Agent, together with the associated letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) the Stock Consideration into which the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01, which Stock Consideration may be in the form of a
certificate or in book-entry form through a direct registration system, (ii)
cash in the amount equal to the Cash Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01 and (iii) any cash in lieu of fractional
shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.03(e)
and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.03(c). In the event of a transfer
of any Certificate representing ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate or book-entry
interest representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.01, cash in the amount equal to the Cash Consideration
which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01 and cash in
lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 2.03(e) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions
which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.03(c) may be
issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.03(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder of such Certificate is
entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01 (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(e) and in respect
of any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate, but in lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or
more Book-Entry Shares shall upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive,
upon the delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver and pay upon
the delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal
(x) the Stock Consideration into which such Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01, which Stock Consideration may be in the
form of a certificate or in book-entry form through a direct registration
system, (y) cash in the amount equal to the Cash

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration into which such Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant
to Section 2.01 and (z) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.03(e).

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Unexchanged Certificates._ No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.03(e), until the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this ARTICLE II. Subject to
escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.03(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
ARTICLE II upon the surrender of Certificates (or in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, upon the delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal), including any cash paid as Cash Consideration or pursuant to
Section 2.03(e), shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificates or such Book-Entry
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Initial Surviving
Corporation (or, if after the Subsequent Effective Time, of the Surviving
Corporation) of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II.

 



 

(e) _No Fractional Shares._ No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of
Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the
Initial Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount
multiplied by the average of the volume weighted average price per share of
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") (as reported
by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually selected by Parent and the Company) on each of the ten consecutive
trading days ending with the second complete trading day prior to the Closing
Date (such average, the " _Average Price_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former
holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE
II.

 



 

(g) _No Liability._ None of the Company, Parent, the Merger Subsidiaries or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent in (i) short-term obligations of the
United States of America, (ii) short-term direct obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of principal and interest and/or (iii) short-term commercial
paper rated the highest quality by each of Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and
Standard and Poors Ratings Services. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent. Parent shall promptly replace
any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent lost through any investment made
pursuant to this Section 2.03(h).

 



 

(i) _Withholding Rights._ Each of Parent, the Initial Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Deferred Stock Units such amounts
as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock, Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Deferred Stock Units
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

(j) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver and pay,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 2.04 _Equity Awards_. (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take such actions as are necessary (including obtaining any
resolutions of the Company Board or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plans or any Company Deferred Compensation

target performance level and the Specified Performance Level and (B) in the
event the Closing Date occurs on or following the completion of the
performance period applicable to such Performance-Based RSU, at the

Time to the extent required under the terms of the holders award agreement
with respect to such awards; _provided_ that, to the extent any such amounts

Parents Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Parent
Subsidiaries (other than the Merger Subsidiaries), where the failure to be so

Parent Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, operation or
leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,

any way to the price of any class of Parent Capital Stock or any shares of

SECTION 3.04 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and Subsequent Merger Sub has, or in the case of Merger Sub
and Subsequent Merger Sub, will have as of the date it executes and delivers a
Joinder, all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver,
in the case of Parent, this Agreement and, in the case of Merger Sub and
Subsequent Merger Sub, a Joinder, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject, in the case of the Share Issuance, to the receipt of the
Parent Shareholder Approval. The Parent Board has adopted resolutions, by
unanimous vote at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors of
Parent was present, (i) approving this Agreement, (ii) determining that
entering into this Agreement is in the best interests of Parent and its
shareholders and (iii) recommending that Parents shareholders vote in favor

Shareholder_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Approval_ "), (B) the adoption of the resolutions of the Merger Subsidiaries
contemplated by Section 6.16 and (C) the approval of Parent contemplated by
Section 6.16, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or either
of the Merger Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as
applicable, this Agreement or a Joinder or to consummate the Initial Merger or
the Subsequent Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except for the filing of the appropriate merger documents as
required by the WBCL). Parent has duly executed and delivered this Agreement
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement and the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Merger
Subsidiaries of a Joinder, this Agreement constitutes, or will constitute, as
the case may be, the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and

By-laws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any Parent
Subsidiary (including the articles of incorporation and by-laws of each of
Merger Sub and the Subsequent Merger Sub), (ii) conflict with, or result in
any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or acceleration of
any obligation, any obligation to make an offer to purchase or redeem any

result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary under, any provision of, any contract, lease,
license, indenture, note, bond, agreement, concession, franchise or other
instrument (a " _Contract_ ") to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or any
Parent Permit or (iii) subject to the shareholder approvals referred to in
Section 3.04 and the filings and other matters referred to in Section 3.05(b),
conflict with, or result in any violation of any provision of, any judgment,
order or decree (" _Judgment_ ") or statute, law (including common law),
ordinance, rule or regulation, including the rules and regulations of the NYSE
(" _Law_ "), in each case, applicable to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or
their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii) above, (x) the Consents set forth on Section 3.05(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter under the heading "Parent Required Consents" (the " _Parent

SECTION 3.06 _SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_. (a) Parent has
furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated therein)
required to be furnished or filed by Parent with the SEC since January 1, 2012
(such documents, but excluding the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4,
being collectively referred to as the " _Parent Reporting Documents_ ").

 



 

(b) Each Parent Reporting Document (i) at the time filed, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("
_SOX_ "), the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent
Reporting Document and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then
at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent Reporting
Documents complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except,
in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods and as of
the dates involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments).

 



 

(c) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities of any nature

reflected or reserved against in the most recent audited balance sheet
(including the notes thereto) of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries included
in the Parent Reporting Documents filed prior to the date hereof, (ii)
incurred after December 31, 2013, in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (iii) expressly contemplated by or incurred in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (iv)
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) Each of the chief executive officer of Parent and the chief financial
officer of Parent (or each former chief financial officer of Parent, as
applicable) has made all applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or
15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to
the Parent Reporting Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement, "chief
executive officer" and "chief financial officer" shall have the meanings given
to such terms in SOX.

 



 

(e) Parent maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Parents properties or assets.

 



 

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Parent are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and

 



      
 

 



 

reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
communicated to the management of Parent, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of Parent to make the certifications
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



 

(g) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
the Parent Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance-sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries in Parents or such Parent Subsidiarys published
financial statements or other Parent Reporting Documents.

 



 

(h) Since January 1, 2014, none of Parent, Parents independent accountants,
the Parent Board or the audit committee of the Parent Board has received any
oral or written notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Parent, (y) "material weakness"
in the internal controls over financial reporting of Parent or (z) fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of Parent
who have a significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting
of Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"
and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them in Auditing
Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the " _PCAOB_
"), as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(i) None of the Parent Subsidiaries, other than Wisconsin Electric Power
Company, is, or has at any time since January 1, 2014 been, subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

SECTION 3.07 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or the Merger Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with
the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is
declared effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint
Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to each of Parents
shareholders and the Companys shareholders or at the time of each of the
Parent Shareholders Meeting and the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, except that no representation is made by Parent or the Merger
Subsidiaries with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. The Joint Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange

 



      
 

 



 

Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation is
made by Parent or the Merger Subsidiaries with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

business consistent with past practice, which changes could not reasonably be
expected to materially

 



      
 

 



 

increase the costs to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) the taking of
any action to accelerate the time of vesting, funding or payment of any
material compensation or benefits under any Parent Benefit Plan or Parent

material liability under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA.

 



 

(f) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
is so qualified and such plan has received a currently effective favorable
determination letter or opinion to that effect from the IRS and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, there is no reason why any such determination letter
should be revoked or not be reissued.

termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) will (i) entitle
any Parent Personnel to any material compensation or benefit, (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any
material compensation or benefit or trigger any other material obligation
under any Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Agreement or (iii) result in

and regulations of FERC that are entitled to exemption from regulation under

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

and supplements appertaining thereto, including all rates, tariffs and related
documents, and all such filings complied, as of their respective dates, with
all applicable requirements of applicable statutes and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, except for filings the failure of which to
make or the failure of which to make in compliance with all applicable
requirements of applicable statutes and the rules and regulations

 



      
 

 



 

promulgated thereunder, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2012, neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries
has received any written notice or, to Parents Knowledge, other communication
from the NERC regarding any actual or possible material violation of, or

whole or in part, any nuclear generating facilities. With respect to Parents
former interest in the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant, Parent is in
compliance with all requirements of the agreement governing the sale of such
plant, except where such non-compliance has not and would not be reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. There are no contingent liabilities for Parent associated with
Parents prior ownership or operation of the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant,
except such contingent liabilities that would not be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

SECTION 3.22 _Trading_. None of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
(other than any Parent Subsidiary that is a regulated public utility with
franchise service obligations for retail electricity or gas supply in the

SECTION 3.24 _Merger Subsidiaries_. From and after the date of incorporation
of each of Merger Sub and Subsequent Merger Sub, Parent will be the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub and Subsequent Merger Sub, respectively. As of the
date that each of the Merger Subsidiaries executes a Joinder, neither Merger
Sub nor Subsequent Merger Sub will have, since its date of incorporation,
carried on any business or conducted any operations other than the execution
of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters
ancillary thereto.

 



 

SECTION 3.25 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor any
Parent Subsidiaries or other affiliates beneficially owns (as such term is

jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Company
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority and
possesses all Permits necessary to enable it to own, operate, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to
have such power or authority or to possess Company Permits, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction
where the nature of its business or the ownership, operation or leasing of its
properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made available to
Parent, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of the

to the effect that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid is
fair to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) is
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For purposes hereof,
"Excluded Holders" shall refer to the Company, Parent or any Merger
Subsidiary, each in their capacity as holders of any Company Common Stock.

 



 

SECTION 4.21 _Regulation as a Public Utility_. (a) The Company is regulated as
a "public utility holding company" in the State of Wisconsin. Other than (i)
The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company, which is a regulated public utility in
the State of Illinois, (ii) Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, which is a
regulated public utility in the State of Wisconsin and the State of Michigan,
(iii) Minnesota Energy Resources Corporation, which is a regulated public
utility in the State of Minnesota, (iv) Michigan Gas Utilities Corporation,
which is a regulated public utility in the State of Michigan, (v) North Shore
Gas Company, which is a regulated public utility in the State of Illinois and
(vi) Upper Peninsula Power Company, which

 



      
 

 



 

is a regulated public utility in the State of Michigan, none of the Company
Subsidiaries is regulated as a public utility or subject to such regulation by
any state.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company Subsidiaries that engages in the sale of electricity
at wholesale (other than any such Subsidiaries that own one or more facilities
that constitute a "qualifying facility" as such term is defined under the
PURPA and the rules and regulations of FERC that are entitled to exemption
from regulation under Section 205 of the Power Act) is regulated as a "public
utility" under the Power Act and has market-based rate authorization to make
such sales at market-based rates. Each of the Company Subsidiaries that
directly owns generating facilities and operates them is in compliance with
all applicable standards of the NERC, other than non-compliance that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, judicial or administrative proceedings to revoke a
Company Subsidiarys market-based rate authorization. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no facts that are reasonably likely to cause any of the
Company Subsidiaries that sell electricity at wholesale to lose its market-
based rate authorization, if applicable, other than where such loss would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) All filings (other than immaterial filings) required to be made by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries since January 1, 2012, with the
FERC under the Power Act, the DOE and any State Utilities Commission, as the
case may be, have been made, including all forms, statements, reports,
agreements and all documents, exhibits, amendments and supplements
appertaining thereto, including all rates, tariffs and related documents, and
all such filings complied, as of their respective dates, with all applicable
requirements of applicable statutes and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, except for filings the failure of which to make or the failure of
which to make in compliance with all applicable requirements of applicable
statutes and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2012, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has received any written notice or, to the Companys Knowledge,
other communication from the NERC regarding any actual or possible material
violation of, or material failure to comply with, any Law.

 



 

(e) None of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries currently owns or
operates, in whole or in part, any nuclear generating facilities. With respect
to the Companys former interest in the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, the
Company is in compliance with all requirements of the agreement governing the
sale of such plant, except where such non-compliance has not and would not be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. There are no contingent liabilities for the Company
associated with the Companys prior ownership or operation of the Kewaunee
Nuclear Power Plant, except such contingent liabilities that would not be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

SECTION 4.22 _Trading_. IES has established risk parameters, limits and
guidelines (the " _Company Trading Guidelines_ ") in compliance with the risk
management policy

 



      
 

 



 

approved by the Company Board, the board of directors of IES and the Integrys
Energy Risk Oversight Committee (" _IROC_ ") to restrict the level of risk
that IES and its Subsidiaries are authorized to take with respect to, among
other things, the net position resulting from all physical commodity
transactions, exchange-traded futures and options transactions, and over-the-
counter derivatives transactions (the " _Net Company Position_ ") and monitors
compliance by IES and its Subsidiaries with such Company Trading Guidelines.
The Company has provided a copy of the Company Trading Guidelines to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement. At no time between March 31, 2014 and the
date of this Agreement, (i) has the Net Company Position not been within the
risk parameters in all material respects that are set forth in the Company
Trading Guidelines, other than as approved by IROC in accordance with the
procedures contained in the Company Trading Guidelines and (ii) has the
exposure of IES and its Subsidiaries with respect to the Net Company Position
resulting from all such transactions been material to Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. From March 31, 2014 to the date of this
Agreement, IES and its Subsidiaries have not, in accordance with generally
recognized mark to market accounting policies, experienced an aggregate net
loss in their trading and related operations that would be material to Company
and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole. None of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (other than (x) IES and (y) any Company Subsidiary
that is a regulated public utility with franchise service obligations for
retail electricity or gas supply in the State of Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan
or Minnesota) engage in any physical commodity transactions, exchange traded
futures and options transactions, and over-the-counter derivatives
transactions.

 



 

SECTION 4.23 _Takeover Statutes_. Assuming the representation and warranty
made by Parent in Section 3.25 is true and correct, no state "fair price,"
"control share acquisition" or similar anti-takeover statute is applicable to
this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company has taken all necessary action to render the restrictions on business
combinations contained in the WBCL inapplicable to this Agreement, the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

SECTION 4.24 _Ownership of Parent Common Stock_. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiaries or other affiliates beneficially owns (as such term is
defined for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) any shares of
Parent Common Stock or any other class or series of Parent Capital Stock.

and shall instruct, and shall cause its Affiliates to instruct, its and their
respective directors, officers or employees or any of their respective
investment bankers, accountants, attorneys or other advisors, agents or
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, (i) directly or
indirectly solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, induce or knowingly
facilitate any Parent Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Takeover Proposal, or (ii) directly
or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person

Parent Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to lead to a Parent Takeover Proposal. Parent shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with
any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent Takeover Proposal,
or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished and immediately terminate all
physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person

written Parent Takeover Proposal that the Parent Board determines in

 



      
 

 



 

good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Parent Proposal, and which Parent Takeover
Proposal was not solicited by Parent, its Affiliates or Representatives after
the date of this Agreement and was made after the date of this Agreement and
did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.02(a), Parent, and
its Representatives at the request of Parent, may, subject to compliance with
Section 5.02(c), (A) furnish information with respect to Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Parent Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to the Company or is provided to the Company prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such Person
than the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) participate in discussions
regarding the terms of such Parent Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of
such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Parent Takeover
Proposal (and such Persons Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing,
it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
5.02(a) by any Representative of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall
constitute a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by Parent.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Parent Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to the
Company), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
the Company), the approval or recommendation by the Parent Board or any such
committee thereof with respect to this Agreement, the Mergers, or the Share
Issuance or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Parent Takeover Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or allow Parent or
any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement or arrangement (other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.02(a)) (an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ ") constituting or relating to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Parent Takeover Proposal, or requiring,
or reasonably expected to cause, Parent or the Merger Subsidiaries to abandon,
terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede,
interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, Parent or the Merger Subsidiaries to fail to comply with
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Shareholder Approval, the Parent Board may terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(f)(ii); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Board may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)(ii) unless (i) the Parent
Board has provided prior written notice to the Company (a " _Parent Notice_ ")
that it is prepared to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(f)(ii) in response to a Superior Parent Proposal, which notice shall
attach the most current draft of any written agreement relating to the
transaction that constitutes such Superior Parent Proposal, (ii) the Company
does not, within four Business Days after the receipt of such Parent Notice
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or
any other material term of a Superior Parent Proposal shall require a new
Parent Notice and a new four Business Day period), propose changes to this
Agreement that would, in the reasonable good

 



      
 

 



 

faith judgment of the Parent Board (after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel), cause
the offer previously constituting a Superior Parent Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Parent Proposal, and (iii) at the end of such four
Business Day period and taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the Company, the Parent Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel) that the failure to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)(ii) as a result of such Superior Parent
Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Parent agrees that, during the four Business Day period prior to terminating
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)(ii) in response to a Superior
Parent Proposal, if requested by the Company, Parent and its Representatives
shall negotiate in good faith with the Company and its Representatives
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by the Company. In determining whether to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)(ii), the Parent Board shall take into
account all written or oral information, opinions or analyses submitted by or
on behalf of the Company, and any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Company in response to such a Parent Notice.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Shareholder Approval, the Parent Board may effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change (x) as a result of the occurrence of a Parent
Intervening Event or (y) in response to a Superior Parent Proposal, in each
case if the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel and after taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the Company during the four Business Day period referred
to in clause (ii) below) that the failure to effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change as a result of the occurrence of such Parent Intervening
Event or in response to such Superior Parent Proposal, as the case may be,
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Parent
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Board may not
effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change under this clause (d) unless (i)
the Parent Board has provided four Business Days prior written notice to the
Company that it is prepared to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to a Parent Intervening Event or a Superior Parent Proposal, which
notice shall, in the case of a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Parent Proposal, include summaries of the material
facts, circumstances and other information that the Parent Board considered in
connection with the making of any such determination and (ii) during such four
Business Day period, if requested by the Company, the Parent Board negotiates
in good faith with the Company and its Representatives regarding any revisions
to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by the
Company.

 



 

(e) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 5.02, Parent shall promptly advise (and in any event
within 48 hours) the Company orally and in writing of any Parent Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Parent Takeover
Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making
any such Parent Takeover Proposal. Parent shall keep the Company informed in
all material respects on a current basis of the terms and status (including
any change to the terms thereof) of any Parent Takeover Proposal.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit Parent from (i)
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of Parent if, in the good faith
judgment of the Parent Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Parent Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 5.02.

Proposal from any Person (other than the Company, its Subsidiaries or

which the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized

negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Company
Takeover Proposal (and such Persons Representatives). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section

 



      
 

 



 

5.03(a) by any Representative of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall
constitute a breach of this Section 5.03(a) by the Company.

Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(e)(ii); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e)(ii) unless (i) the
Company Board has provided prior written notice to Parent (a " _Company
Notice_ ") that it is prepared to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(e)(ii) in response to a Superior Company Proposal, which notice shall
attach the most current draft of any written agreement relating to the
transaction that constitutes such Superior Company Proposal, (ii) Parent does
not, within four Business Days after the receipt of such Company Notice (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material term of a Superior Company Proposal shall require a new Company
Notice and a new four Business Day period), propose changes to this Agreement
that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company Board (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel), cause the offer previously constituting a Superior
Company Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Company Proposal, and
(iii) at the end of such four Business Day period and taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of

period prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e)(ii) in
response to a Superior Company Proposal, if requested by Parent, the Company
and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction

case if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel and after taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent during the four Business Day period referred to
in clause (ii) below) that the failure to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change as a result of the occurrence of such Company
Intervening Event or in response to such Superior Company Proposal, as the
case may be, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company Board may not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
under this clause (d) unless (i) the Company Board has provided four Business
Days prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event or a
Superior Company Proposal, which notice shall, in the case of a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Company Proposal,

determination and (ii) during such four Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company Board negotiates in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations

resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 5.03.

and to include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, but only to
the extent that the Parent Board has made a Parent Adverse Recommendation

party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of
such third party to such access or disclosure) or subject to any attorney-
client privilege ( _provided_ that the withholding party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of
it as possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege) or is commercially sensitive. If any material is withheld by such
party pursuant to one or more of the provisos to the preceding sentence, such
party shall inform the other party as to the general nature of what is being
withheld to the extent that doing so would not undermine the protection of the
relevant proviso. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to

terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all

the Company Board and Parent and the Parent Board, as the case may be, shall

Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain all such required Consents or nonactions from such Governmental
Entities and eliminate each and every other impediment that may be asserted by
such Governmental Entities pursuant to any Antitrust Law or in connection with
granting the Company Required Statutory Approvals or the Parent Required
Statutory Approvals, in each case with respect to the Initial Merger, so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible. In furtherance and
not in limitation of its obligations under Section 6.03(a), but subject to
Section 6.03(f), the Company and Parent each shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, undertake any effort or take any action (including
accepting terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments or
sanctions and proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.03, (i) Parent shall have
primary responsibility for scheduling and conducting any meeting with any

with, and resolving any investigation or other inquiry of, any agency or other
Governmental Entity, obtaining the Parent Required Statutory Approvals and the
Company Required Statutory Approvals, Required Consents, Consents, Permits and
other approvals and confirmations from any Governmental Entity necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that Parent agrees to consult with the Company

communication from any Person alleging that such Persons Consent is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) any
actions, suits, claims, litigations, investigations or proceedings commenced
or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Company
Board that, in any such case, relate to this Agreement or the transactions

of this Section 6.03 shall not be construed to (i) require Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary or (ii) permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary without

action (including accepting any terms,

 



      
 

 



 

conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments or sanctions and proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of assets

resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Regulatory
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

SECTION 6.04 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) Each of Parent
and the Company agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of either Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries or the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents) and any indemnification or other similar agreements of Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries or the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall
be continued or assumed by Parent and the Surviving Corporation following the
Mergers, without further action, and shall survive the Mergers and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 



 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to procure the provision of officers and directors
liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each Person currently covered by the Companys or any
of the Company Subsidiaries officers and directors liability insurance
policy on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts that are at least as
favorable as those of the applicable policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ that, if the aggregate annual premium for such insurance
exceeds 300% of the current annual premium for such insurance, then Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals
with the best coverage as is then available at a cost up to but not exceeding
300% of such current aggregate annual premium. In lieu of such insurance,
prior to the Closing Date, Parent may, following consultation with the
Company, purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy
and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary on
terms with respect to coverage and in amounts that are at least as favorable
as those of the applicable policy in effect on the date of this Agreement and
subject to the proviso of the immediately preceding sentence, in which event
Parent shall cease to have any obligations under the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.04 (i) shall survive consummation of the
Mergers, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by contract or otherwise.

SECTION 6.06 _Certain Tax Matters_. (a) For U.S. Federal income Tax purposes,
(i) the parties intend that the Initial Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together as a single integrated transaction, qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code in which the
Company is to be treated as merging directly with and into Subsequent Merger
Sub with the Company Common Stock converted in such merger into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (the "Intended Tax Treatment"), and (ii) this
Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a), to which the Company, Parent
and Subsequent Merger Sub are parties under Section 368(b) of the Code.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Subsequent Merger Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Initial Merger and the Subsequent
Merger to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, including by not taking any
action that such party knows is reasonably likely to prevent such
qualification. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Subsequent Merger
Sub shall report the Initial Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
Intended Tax Treatment.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Subsequent Merger Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Tax opinions described in
Sections 7.02(d) and 7.03(e), including by making representations and
covenants requested by Tax counsel in order to render such Tax opinions. Each
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Subsequent Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would
cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which
inaction would cause to be untrue) any of the representations and covenants
made to Tax counsel in furtherance of such Tax opinions.

 



 

(d) To the extent necessary, Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Subsequent Merger
Sub shall work together in good faith to effect the combination contemplated
by this Agreement using an alternative structure that would be tax-free to the
extent of the Stock Consideration in the event that (i) the Intended Tax
Treatment cannot be achieved, (ii) the Tax opinions described in Section
7.02(d) and Section 7.03(d) are not issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) Parent reasonably determines that the
Subsequent Merger may result in a constructive termination of American
Transmission Company LLC under Section 708 of the Code.

 



 

SECTION 6.07 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to applicable law, the Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed in respect of any litigation against the
Company or its directors relating to the Initial Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company agrees that it shall not
agree to any settlement of such litigation without Parents prior consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably informed in respect of any litigation
against Parent or its directors relating to the Initial Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

SECTION 6.08 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all such steps as may be required to

respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the Initial Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who will
be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the Initial Merger and the

relied upon; (xiii) assisting Parent in connection with the amendment of any
of the Companys or Company Subsidiaries hedging, swap or derivative
arrangements on terms satisfactory to Parent; and (xiv) updating any Required

the Effective Time and none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall be required to take any action under any such certificate, document or
agreement that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into
any agreement that is effective before the Effective Time) or that would be
effective before the Effective Time. The Company hereby consents to the
reasonable use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries trademarks, service
marks and logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such
trademarks, service marks and logos are used in a manner that is not intended
to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and their Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by it in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing (including all actions taken in accordance with
this Section 6.09(b)) and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than historical information relating to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Company or

reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs

and conditions that are consistent with the requirements of the Notes and
otherwise reasonably specified, from time to time, by Parent: (i) make an
offer to purchase with respect to all of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of the Notes (the " _Debt Tender Offer_ "), (ii) on the Closing Date,

the Trustee sufficient to prepay and satisfy and discharge such Notes pursuant

in violation of Law or the Indenture in connection with the Change of Control
Refinancing. The Company shall provide, shall cause the Compay Subsidiaries

(b) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation
(including, if applicable, all mailings to the holders of the Notes and all
SEC filings) in connection with the Change of Control Refinancing. Parent and
the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of
such documentation, which shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment
by, the Company. If at any time prior to the completion of the Change of
Control Refinancing any information in such documentation should be discovered
by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to such documentation, so that such documentation shall not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,
the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent (subject
to the review of, and comment by, the Company) describing such information
shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
the holders of the Notes.

 



 

(c) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all documented reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Section
6.10. Without duplication of any amounts reimbursed by Parent pursuant to the
immediately foregoing sentence, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Affiliates and their respective officers, advisors and
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interests, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
any of them of any type in connection with the Change of Control Refinancing
and/or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information provided in writing specifically for such use by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Affiliates) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, including losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interests,
awards, judgments and penalties arising out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
documentation relating to any Change of Control Refinancing, or arising out of
or are based upon the omission or alleged omission of a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided, however,
that Parent shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
loss, damage, claim, cost, expense, interest, award, judgment or penalty
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documentation in reliance
upon information provided in writing specifically for such use by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Affiliates).

 



       
 

 



 

(d) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent copies of payoff letters, in form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, from the administrative agent under the
Companys existing credit facilities and shall make arrangements for the
release of all Liens and other security over the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries properties and assets, if any, securing its obligations under
such existing credit facilities that are being prepaid and terminated on the
Closing Date (to the extent Liens under such historic credit facilities or
other financing have not previously been released), together with the return
of any collateral in the possession of the relevant administrative agent or
the collateral agent effective as of the Effective Time.

 



 

SECTION 6.11 _Governance Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall take all necessary action to cause, effective at the
Effective Time, the Parent Board to increase the number of the directors
constituting the Board of Parent to a total of 12.

 



 

(b) Parent shall take all necessary action to cause, effective at the
Effective Time, three directors serving on the Company Board immediately prior
to the Effective Time to be elected or appointed as members to the Parent
Board to fill the increase created by the action described in Section 6.11(a),
with such directors to be selected by the Company in consultation with the
Parent, provided that such directors will satisfy the NYSE independence
requirements and the FERC interlocking directorship requirements, and taking
into account the Parents Corporate Governance Guidelines.

 



 

(c) Parent shall take all necessary action to cause, effective at the
Effective Time, (i) the location of the corporate headquarters and principal

SECTION 6.12 _Dividends_. (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall coordinate
with the other regarding the declaration and payment of dividends in respect
of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of Parent and the
Company that no holder of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall
receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single
calendar quarter with respect to its shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock, as the case may be, and/or any shares of Parent Common Stock any
holder of Company Common Stock receives pursuant to the Merger.

 



 

(b) The Parent Board shall adopt and approve a new dividend policy (the "
_Dividend Policy_ ") to take effect following the Effective Time relating to
the payment of dividends on the outstanding Parent Common Stock after the
Closing Date. The Dividend Policy shall provide for a quarterly dividend per
share of Parent Common Stock in an amount equal to the quarterly dividend
amount paid per share by the Company on the outstanding Company

 



      
 

 



 

Common Stock on the most recent dividend payment date of the Company prior to
the Effective Time divided by the Dividend Exchange Ratio. The " _Dividend
Exchange Ratio_ " will be calculated by dividing the value of the Merger
Consideration by the Average Price. For purposes of this calculation, the
value of the Stock Consideration will be assumed to be equal to the Average
Price multiplied by the exchange ratio provided for in Section 2.01(c)(ii).

 



 

SECTION 6.13 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other written public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Mergers, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such written
public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. The Company and Parent agree
that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the parties.

 



 

SECTION 6.14 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
the Initial Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, in each case

shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in
connection with the foregoing, including by providing information reasonably
requested by Parent in connection therewith.

 



 

SECTION 6.15 _Employee Matters_. (a) During the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the
" _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide each individual who was employed
by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continues such employment with Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) thereafter
(each, a " _Company Employee_ "), and who is not covered by a Company Union
Contract, with compensation and benefits, in each case, that are no less
favorable than the compensation and benefits provided to the Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries not
to, amend or otherwise adjust any such Company Employees health, dental,
vision or disability benefits any time following the Continuation Period and
prior to December 31 of the year following the year in which the Effective
Time occurs to the extent that such amendment or adjustment would subject such
Company Employee to any additional costs (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any early termination fees, pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting periods or lost credit for
co-payments, deductibles or similar expenses). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries to, provide each Company Employee who is not covered by a
Company Union Contract whose employment is terminated during the Continuation
Period with severance and other separation benefits that are no less favorable
than the severance and other separation benefits provided to such Company
Employee by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) With respect to each Company Employee who is covered by a Company Union
Contract, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to continue to honor the Company Union Contracts, in each case as
in effect at the Effective Time, in accordance with their terms. The
provisions of this Section 6.15 shall be subject to any applicable provisions
of the Company Union Contracts and applicable Law in respect of such Company
Employee, to the extent the provisions of this Section 6.15 are inconsistent
with or otherwise in conflict with the provisions of any such Union Contract
or applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 6.15(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, to provide (i) nonsupervisory
Company Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement between
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Local 420 of the International Union
of Operation Engineers dated October 14, 2012, and (ii) any other
nonsupervisory Company Employees as determined by Parent who were employed by
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time
and are covered by Wis. Stat. § 196.807, to the extent applicable, with at
least the same wages and substantially equivalent fringe benefits and other
terms and conditions of employment that such Company Employees received
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case for a period of thirty
months following the Effective Time, unless different terms and conditions of
employment are collectively bargained.

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, assume and honor in accordance with their
terms all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries employment, severance,
retention, termination and change in control plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements (including any change in control severance
agreement or other arrangement between the Company and any Company Employee)
maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event).

 



 

(e) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid
time-off and severance plans), each Company Employees service with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service
with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Company
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Subsidiaries for all purposes (other than benefit accrual
under any defined benefit plan or frozen benefit plan or vesting under any
equity incentive plan), including determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, except to the extent that
such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service or for purposes of
qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits.

 



 

(f) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, waive, or
cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively at work

 



      
 

 



 

requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in which
Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the
dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by
each Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

 



 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement containing a definition of "change in control",
"change of control" or similar term, the Closing shall be deemed to constitute
a "change in control", "change of control" or such similar term.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 6.15 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.15 is intended to, or
shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any
employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the
right to enforce the provisions hereof including in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment). Nothing contained herein shall alter the
at-will employment relationship of any Company Employee.

 



 

SECTION 6.16 _Creation of Merger Subsidiaries_. Within thirty days of the date
of this Agreement, Parent shall cause to be formed the Merger Subsidiaries and
shall cause the Merger Subsidiaries to become parties to this Agreement
through the execution of a Joinder. Immediately prior to executing a Joinder,
Parent shall (i) cause each of the Merger Subsidiaries to adopt resolutions
(A) approving this Agreement and approving the execution and delivery of a
Joinder, (B) determining that entering into this Agreement through a Joinder
is in the best interests of Merger Sub or Subsequent Merger Sub, as
applicable, and Parent, its sole shareholder and (C) recommending that Parent,
as its sole shareholder, adopt this Agreement and a Joinder and directing that
this Agreement be submitted to Parent, as its sole shareholder, for approval,
and (ii) approve this Agreement and a Joinder in its capacity as the sole
shareholder of each of the Merger Subsidiaries.

 



 

SECTION 6.17 _Company Owned Real Property; Company Leased Real Property_.
Within 30 days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver
to Parent a list of all Company Owned Real Property (including the street
address and name of the fee owner) and the Company Leased Real Property
(including the street address and the names of the parties to the applicable

 _General Provisions_

 



 

SECTION 9.01 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties; Limitation on
Remedies_. (a) None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or
in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time. After the Effective Time, no party may bring any suit, action
or proceeding based in whole or in part upon any actual or alleged inaccuracy
in any such representation or warranty, whether based on fraud, gross
negligence, negligence, breach of contract, breach of statute or otherwise,
except to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent mandatory applicable Law prohibits the exclusion of liability for
fraudulent misrepresentation.

 



 

(b) After the Effective Time, no party may bring any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether based on fraud, gross negligence, negligence,
breach of contract, breach of statute or otherwise, except to the extent
mandatory applicable Law prohibits the waiver of the right to rescission for
fraudulent misrepresentation. Each party acknowledges that, following the
Effective Time, the trading of Parent Common Stock by former holders of
Company Common Stock will make the remedy of rescission impractical and

ARTICLE III to the extent (and only to the extent) that it is reasonably
apparent that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other
sections. The Company Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and
lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections
contained in ARTICLE IV, and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to
qualify other sections in ARTICLE IV to the extent (and only to the extent)
that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure also qualifies or applies
to such other sections.

 



 

SECTION 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under
this Section 9.05 with respect thereto. Upon any determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to

 



      
 

 



 

modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

SECTION 9.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

 



 

SECTION 9.07 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
taken together with the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) except for Section
2.04 and Section 6.04, is not intended to confer, and does not confer, upon
any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies; provided that,
notwithstanding this clause (b), the provisions of Section 8.03(a), Section
8.04(c), this Section 9.07, Section 9.11(b), Section 9.11(c) and Section 9.13
shall be enforceable by each Financing Source.

 



 

SECTION 9.08 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. (a) Except for the
representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE III, the Company
acknowledges that (i) none of Parent, Merger Sub, Subsequent Merger Sub, the
other Parent Subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of Parent makes any
other express or implied representation or warranty in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) it has relied solely on the
representations and warranties of Parent, Merger Sub and Subsequent Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement and (iii) it has not been induced to enter into
this Agreement by any representation, warranty or other statement of or by
Parent, Merger Sub, Subsequent Merger Sub, any other Parent Subsidiary or any
other Person on behalf of Parent.

 



 

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE IV,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and Subsequent Merger Sub acknowledges that (i)
none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of
the Company makes any other express or implied representation or warranty in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) it has
relied solely on the representations and warranties of the Company contained
in this Agreement and (iii) it has not been induced to enter into this
Agreement by any representation, warranty or other statement of or by the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any other Person on behalf of the Company.

 



 

(c) No party shall have any liability or shall have any remedy in respect of
any misrepresentation or untrue statement unless, and solely to the extent
that, a claim lies for breach of a representation or warranty included in this
Agreement. This Section 9.08(c) shall not apply to the extent mandatory
applicable Law prohibits the exclusion of liability for fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 



 

SECTION 9.09 _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, REGARDLESS
OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE

 



      
 

 



 

GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF
WISCONSIN.

 



 

SECTION 9.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

SECTION 9.11 _Specific Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in clause (a) of Section 9.12, without proof of actual damages
(and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if
under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof). The parties hereto further agree that all of the
provisions of Section 9.13 relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party-claim referenced in
this Section 9.11(b).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Representatives or Affiliates
shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection
with or related to this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. In addition, no Financing Source shall have
any liability or obligation to the Company or any of the Companys
Representatives in connection with or related to this Agreement, the Financing
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including for any
consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any
loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious
nature. For avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event shall this

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.11(c) apply to Parent, whether before or after the Closing, and (ii)
from and after the Closing, the foregoing shall not modify or alter in any
respect any provision of any definitive loan documentation between or among
Parent, the Company (or the Surviving Corporation), and any of their
Subsidiaries and any Financing Source entered into in connection with or as
contemplated by this Agreement, and in the event of a conflict between the
foregoing and any provision in any such definitive loan documentation, the
provisions of such definitive loan documentation shall govern and control.

 



 

SECTION 9.12 _Jurisdiction; Venue_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Wisconsin State court or
any Federal court located in the State of Wisconsin in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement, the Initial Merger, the Subsequent Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement, the Initial Merger, the Subsequent
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than any Wisconsin State court or any Federal court sitting in the
State of Wisconsin.

 



 

SECTION 9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement, the Initial Merger, the Subsequent Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies
that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any action,
suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this
Section 9.13.

 **ARTICLE I.**

 

 **STOCKHOLDERS**

 



 

1.01. _ Annual Meeting._ The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
corporation shall be held each year on the first business day of June, or on
such earlier or later date and at the time designated by or under the
authority of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the President
or the Corporate Secretary, for the purpose of electing directors and for the
transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting.

 



 

1.02. _ Special Meetings._ Special meetings of the stockholders, for any
purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law, may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President or
a majority of the Board of Directors. If and as required by the Wisconsin
Business Corporation Law, a special meeting shall be called upon written
demand describing one or more purposes for which it is to be held by holders
of shares with at least 10% of the votes entitled to be cast on any issue
proposed to be considered at the meeting. The time and purpose or purposes of
any special meeting shall be described in the notice required by Section 1.04
of these Bylaws and only business within the purpose(s) described in such
notice shall be conducted at such meeting.

 



 

1.03. _ Place of Meetings; Postponements and Adjournments._ The Board of
Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Corporate Secretary
may designate any place, either within or without the State of Wisconsin, as
the place of meeting for any annual meeting or any special meeting, including
any adjourned meeting. The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the
President or the Corporate Secretary may postpone any previously scheduled
annual meeting or special meeting by giving public notice of the postponed
meeting date at any time prior to the scheduled meeting date. If no
designation is made, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the
corporation. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time, whether or not a
quorum is present, by the chairperson of the meeting or by vote of a majority
of the votes entitled to be cast by the shares represented thereat.

 



 

1.04. _ Notices to Stockholders._

 



 

(a) _Required Notice._ Notice may be communicated by mail, private carrier,
or any other means permissible under Wisconsin law. Written notice stating the
scheduled place, day and hour of the meeting and, in case of a special
meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be
communicated or sent not less than ten (10) days, unless a longer period is
required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or the Articles of
Incorporation, nor more than ninety (90) days, unless a longer period is
permitted or a shorter period is required by the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law, before the date of the meeting, by or at the direction of the
Chairman of the Board, the President or the Corporate Secretary, to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting or, for the fundamental
transactions described in subsections (b)(1) to (4) below, for which the
Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires that notice be given to
stockholders not entitled to vote, to all stockholders of record. For purposes
of this Section 1.04, notice by "electronic transmission" (as defined in the
Wisconsin Business Corporation Law) is written notice. Written notice is
effective (1) when mailed, if mailed postpaid and addressed to the

 



      
 

 



 

stockholders address shown in the corporations current record of
stockholders; (2) when electronically transmitted to the stockholder in a
manner authorized by the stockholder. At least twenty (20) days notice shall
be provided if the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to
consider a plan of merger or share exchange for which stockholder approval is
required by law, or the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the corporations property, with or without good will,
otherwise than in the usual and regular course of business. A stockholder may
waive notice in accordance with Section 1.10 of these Bylaws.

 



 

(b) _Fundamental Transactions._ If a purpose of any stockholder meeting is to
consider either: (1) a proposed amendment to the Articles of Incorporation
(including any restated articles); (2) a plan of merger or share exchange for
which stockholder approval is required by law; (3) the sale, lease, exchange
or other disposition of all or substantially all of the corporations
property, with or without good will, otherwise than in the usual and regular
course of business; (4) the dissolution of the corporation; or (5) the removal
of a director, the notice must so state and in cases (1), (2) and (3) above
must be accompanied by, respectively, a copy or summary of the: (1) proposed
articles of amendment or a copy of the restated articles that identifies any
amendment or other change; (2) proposed plan of merger or share exchange; or
(3) proposed transaction for disposition of all or substantially all of the
corporations property. If the proposed corporate action creates dissenters
rights, the notice must state that stockholders and beneficial stockholders
are or may be entitled to assert dissenters rights, and must be accompanied
by a copy of Sections 180.1301 to 180.1331 (or successor provisions) of the
Wisconsin Business Corporation Law.

 



 

1.05. _ Fixing of Record Date._ The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the
Board, the President or the Corporate Secretary or any other officer
authorized by the Board of Directors, may fix in advance a date as the record
date for one or more voting groups for any determination of stockholders
entitled to notice of a stockholders meeting, to demand a special meeting, to
vote, or to take any other action, such date in any case to be not more than
seventy (70) days and, in case of a meeting of stockholders, dividend or stock
split, not less than ten (10) days prior to the meeting or action requiring
such determination of stockholders, and may fix the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to a share dividend or distribution. If
within thirty (30) days after the corporation receives one or more written
demands for a special stockholder meeting that purport to satisfy the
requirements of Section 180.0702(1)(b) of the Wisconsin Business Corporation
Law (or any successor provision) no record date has been fixed pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 1.05 for the determination of stockholders
entitled to demand such a stockholder meeting, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to demand such meeting shall be the date that the first
stockholder signed the demand. If no record date has been fixed pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 1.05 for the determination of stockholders
entitled (A) to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders prior to the
time that notice of the meeting is mailed or otherwise delivered to
stockholders, or (B) to consent to action without a meeting within thirty (30)
days after the corporation receives the first written consent to stockholder
action without a meeting, (a) the close of business on the day before the
first notice of the meeting is mailed or otherwise delivered to stockholders
or (b) the date that the first stockholder signed the first written consent to
stockholder action without a meeting, respectively, shall be the record date
for the determination of such stockholders. When a determination of
stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders has been made as
provided in this section, such determination shall be applied to any

 



      
 

 



 

postponement or adjournment thereof unless the Board of Directors fixes a new
record date and except as otherwise required by law. A new record date must be
set if a meeting is postponed or adjourned to a date more than 120 days after
the date fixed for the original meeting.

 



 

1.06. _ Quorum and Voting Requirements._ Except as otherwise provided in the
Articles of Incorporation or in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast by shares entitled to vote as a
separate voting group on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter at a
meeting of stockholders. If a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than
the election of directors, by a voting group is approved if the votes cast
within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the
action unless a greater number of affirmative votes is required by the
Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation, or any
other provision of these Bylaws. If the Articles of Incorporation or the
Wisconsin Business Corporation Law provide for voting by two (2) or more
classes or voting groups on a matter, action on that matter is taken only when
voted upon by each of those voting groups counted separately.

 



 

1.07. _ Conduct of Meetings._ The Chairman of the Board, or in his absence or
at his request, the President, and in the Presidents absence, a Vice
President, and in their absence, any person chosen by the stockholders present
shall call the meeting of the stockholders to order and shall act as
chairperson of the meeting, and the Corporate Secretary shall act as secretary
of all meetings of the stockholders, but, in the absence of the Corporate
Secretary, the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any other person to act
as secretary of the meeting.

 



 

1.08. _ Voting at Meetings. _ At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder
entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy appointed as provided in the
Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. The means by which a stockholder or the
stockholders authorized officer, director, employee, agent or attorney-in-
fact may authorize another person to act for the stockholder by appointing the
person as proxy include:

 



 

(1) Appointment of a proxy in writing by signing or causing the stockholders
signature to be affixed to an appointment form by any reasonable means,
including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.

 



 

(2) Appointment of a proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of
an electronic transmission of the appointment to the person who will be
appointed as proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service
organization or like agent authorized to receive the transmission by the
person who will be appointed as proxy. Every electronic transmission shall
contain, or be accompanied by, information that can be used to reasonably
determine that the stockholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of
the electronic transmission. Any person charged with determining whether a
stockholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic
transmission shall specify the information upon which the determination is
made.

 



      
 

 



 

An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an
electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of
election or the officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate
votes. An appointment is valid for 11 months unless a different period is
expressly provided in the appointment. An appointment of a proxy is revocable
unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that it is
irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. The presence of a
stockholder who has made an effective proxy appointment shall not of itself
constitute a revocation.

 



 

Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot unless so
determined by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the President
or the Corporate Secretary. Voting at meetings of stockholders shall be
conducted by one or more inspectors of election appointed by the Board of
Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Corporate
Secretary. However, no director or person who is a candidate for the office of
director shall be appointed as such inspector. The inspectors, or persons
representing the inspector if the inspector is an institution, before entering
upon the discharge of their duties, shall take and subscribe an oath
faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict
impartiality and according to the best of their ability.

 



 

1.09. _ Stockholder Unanimous Consent Without a Meeting._ Any action required
by the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or any provision of law to be taken
at a meeting of stockholders or any other action which may be taken at such a
meeting may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing setting forth the
action so taken shall be signed by all of the stockholders entitled to vote
with respect to the subject matter thereof and such consent shall have the
same force and effect as a unanimous vote.

 



 

1.10. _ Stockholder Waiver of Notice._ A stockholder may waive any notice
required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the Articles of
Incorporation or these Bylaws before or after the date and time stated in the
notice. The waiver shall be in writing and signed by the stockholder entitled
to the notice, shall contain the same information that would have been
required in the notice under the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law except
that the time and place of meeting need not be stated, and shall be delivered
to the corporation for inclusion in the corporate records. A stockholders
attendance at a meeting, in person or by proxy, waives objection to both of
the following:

 



 

(a) Lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the stockholder
at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon arrival objects to holding
the meeting or transacting business at the meeting.

 



 

(b) Consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within
the purpose described in the meeting notice, unless the stockholder objects to
considering the matter when it is presented.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE II.**

 

 **BOARD OF DIRECTORS**

 



 

2.01. _ Number._ The number of directors constituting the whole Board of
Directors shall be such number as shall be fixed from time to time by the
affirmative vote of the whole Board but in no event shall the number be less
than three. The number of directors at any time constituting the whole Board
shall not be reduced so as to shorten the term of any director then in office.
Directors need not be stockholders of the corporation.

 



 

2.02. _Term of Office._ The directors shall hold office until the next annual
meeting of stockholders at which their respective terms of office shall expire
and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

 



 

2.03. _ Election and Tenure._ Unless action is taken without a meeting under
these Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by
the shares entitled to vote in the election at a stockholders meeting at which
a quorum is present. Each director shall hold office until the end of such
directors term and until such directors successor has been elected, or until
such directors prior death, resignation or removal. A director may resign at
any time by filing a written resignation with the Corporate Secretary of the
corporation.

 



 

2.04. _ Removal._ If cumulative voting for directors is not authorized by the
Articles of Incorporation, any director or directors may be removed from
office by the stockholders if the number of votes cast to remove the director
exceeds the number cast not to remove him or her, taken at a meeting of
stockholders called for that purpose (unless action is taken without a meeting
under Section 1.09 of these Bylaws), provided that the meeting notice states
that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the
director. The removal may be made with or without cause unless the Articles of
Incorporation or these Bylaws provide that directors may be removed only for
cause. If a director is elected by a voting group of stockholders, only the
stockholders of that voting group may participate in the vote to remove that
director.

 



 

2.05. _ Vacancies._ Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors, including
a vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by
the stockholders or the Board of Directors. If the directors remaining in
office constitute fewer than a quorum of the Board, the directors may fill a
vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of all directors remaining in
office. Each director so elected shall hold office for a term expiring at the
next annual stockholders meeting.

 



 

2.06. _ Regular Meetings._ Regular meetings of the Board of Directors and any
committee thereof shall be held at such time and place, either within or
without the State of Wisconsin, as may from time to time be fixed by the Board
or such committee without other notice than the schedule prepared by the
Corporate Secretary or the resolution or other action of the Board or
committee establishing the time and place of such regular meetings.

 



      
 

 



 

2.07. _ Special Meetings._ Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be
called by or at the request of the Board of Directors, the Executive
Committee, the Chairman of the Board, the President, any committee designated
by the Board with specific authority to do such or any two (2) directors.
Special meetings of any committee may be called by or at the request of the
foregoing persons or the chairman of the committee. The persons calling any
special meeting of the Board of Directors or committee may fix any place,
either within or without the State of Wisconsin, as the place for holding any
special meeting called by them, and if no other place is fixed the place of
meeting shall be the principal business office of the corporation.

 



 

2.08. _ Meetings by Telephone or Other Communication Technology._ (a) Any or
all directors may participate in a regular or special meeting of the Board of
Directors or in a committee meeting by, or conduct the meeting through the use
of, telephone or any other means of communication by which either: (i) all
participating directors may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting
or (ii) all communication during the meeting is immediately transmitted to
each participating director, and each participating director is able to
immediately send messages to all other participating directors.

 



 

(b) If a meeting will be conducted through the use of any means described in
paragraph (a), all participating directors shall be informed that a meeting is
taking place at which official business may be transacted. A director
participating in a meeting by any means described in paragraph (a) is deemed
to be present in person at the meeting.

 



 

2.09. _ Notice of Meetings._ Notice of each meeting of the Board of Directors
(unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to Section 2.06 of these Bylaws)
shall be given by written notice delivered personally or mailed or given by
telephone or telegram to each director at his business address or at such
other address as such director shall have designated in writing filed with the
Corporate Secretary, in each case not less than 6 hours prior thereto. If
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the
United States mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid. If notice be
given by telegram, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when the
telegram is delivered to the telegraph company; if by telephone, at the time
the call is completed. Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given to
any director of the corporation under the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or
any provision of law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time, whether
before or after the time of meeting, by the director entitled to such notice,
shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. The attendance of a
director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting,
except where a director attends a meeting and objects thereat to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the Board need be specified in the notice or
waiver of notice of such meeting.

 



 

2.10. _ Quorum._ Except as otherwise provided by the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law or these Bylaws, a majority of the number of directors as
provided in or pursuant to Section 2.01 shall constitute a quorum of the Board
of Directors, and a majority of the number of directors appointed to serve on
a committee shall constitute a quorum of the committee. If at any meeting of
the Board of Directors or any committee thereof there shall be less than a
quorum present, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting
from time to time, without notice other

 



      
 

 



 

than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall have been obtained,
when any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the
meeting as first convened had there been a quorum.

 



 

2.11. _ Manner of Acting._ The affirmative vote of a majority of the directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof unless the affirmative vote of a
greater number is otherwise required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation
Law, the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws or any provision of law.

 



 

2.12. _ Committees._ The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by the
affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors then in office, may create
one or more committees, each committee to consist of two (2) or more directors
appointed by the Board of Directors to serve as members of the committee,
which to the extent provided in the resolution as initially adopted, and as
thereafter supplemented or amended by further resolution adopted by a like
vote, may exercise the authority of the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no committee may: (a) authorize distributions; (b) approve or
propose to stockholders action that the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law
requires be approved by stockholders; (c) fill vacancies on the Board of
Directors or any of its committees, except that the Board of Directors may
provide by resolution that any vacancies on a committee shall be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining committee members; (d) amend
the Articles of Incorporation; (e) adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws; (f) approve
a plan of merger not requiring stockholder approval; (g) authorize or approve
reacquisition of shares, except according to a formula or method prescribed by
the Board of Directors; or (h) authorize or approve the issuance or sale or
contract for sale of shares, or determine the designation and relative rights,
preferences and limitations of a class or series of shares, except within
limits prescribed by the Board of Directors.

 



 

Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, members of any committee
shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors
may elect one or more of its members as alternate members of any such
committee who may take the place of any absent member or members at any
meeting of such committee, upon request by the Chairman of the Board or upon
request by the chairperson of such meeting. Each such committee shall fix its
own rules (consistent with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the
Articles of Incorporation and these Bylaws) governing the conduct of its
activities and shall make such reports to the Board of Directors of its
activities as the Board of Directors may request. Unless otherwise provided by
the Board of Directors in creating a committee, a committee may employ
counsel, accountants and other consultants to assist it in the exercise of
authority.

 



 

The provisions of Section 2.09 shall also apply to notice and waiver of notice
of meetings of any committee of the Board of Directors.

 



 

2.13. _ Compensation._ The Board of Directors, by affirmative vote of a
majority of the directors then in office, and irrespective of any personal
interest of any of its members, may (a) establish reasonable compensation of
all directors for services to the corporation as directors, officers or
otherwise, and the manner and time and payment thereof, (b) provide for
reasonable pensions, disability or death benefits, and other benefits or
payments, to directors, officers and

 



      
 

 



 

employees and to their estates, families, dependents or beneficiaries on
account of prior services rendered by such directors, officers and employees
to the corporation, and (c) provide for reimbursement of reasonable expenses
incurred in the performance of directors duties.

 



 

2.14. _ Presumption of Assent._ A director who is present and is announced as
present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof at which
action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to
the action taken unless (a) the director objects at the beginning of the
meeting or promptly upon his or her arrival to holding the meeting or
transacting business at the meeting, or (b) the directors dissent or
abstention from the action taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting, or
(c) the director delivers his or her written notice of dissent or abstention
to the presiding officer of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or to
the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting, or (d) the
director dissents or abstains from an action taken, minutes of the meeting are
prepared that fail to show the directors dissent or abstention and the
director delivers to the corporation a written notice of that failure promptly
after receiving the minutes. Such right to dissent or abstain shall not apply
to a director who voted in favor of an action.

 



 

2.15. _ Director Unanimous Consent Without a Meeting._ Any action required or
permitted by the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws or any provision of
law to be taken at a Board of Directors meeting or committee meeting may be
taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all members of the Board or
committee. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents
describing the action taken, signed by each director and retained by the
corporation. Action taken hereunder is effective when the last director signs
the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date. A
consent signed hereunder has the effect of a unanimous vote taken at a meeting
at which all directors or committee members were present, and may be described
as such in any document.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III.**

 

 **OFFICERS**

 



 

3.01. _ Appointment._ The officers of the corporation shall include a Chairman
of the Board, a President, one or more Vice Presidents, and a Corporate

may be appointed by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer. Any

3.02. _ Resignation and Removal._ An officer shall hold office until he or she

corporation accepts the later effective date. Any officer may be removed from
office by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole Board of Directors
and, unless restricted by the Board of Directors, any officer or assistant
officer appointed by the Chief Executive Officer may be removed by the Chief
Executive Officer, at any time, with or without cause and notwithstanding the
contract rights, if any, of the person removed. Except as provided in the
preceding sentence, the resignation or

 



       
 

 



 

removal is subject to any remedies provided by any contract between the
officer and the corporation or otherwise provided by law. Appointment shall
not of itself create contract rights.

 



 

3.03. _ Vacancies._ A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation,
removal or otherwise, may be filled by the Board of Directors or the Chief
Executive Officer, as appropriate. The Board of Directors or the Chief
Executive Officer, as appropriate, may, from time to time, omit to appoint one
or more officers or may omit to fill a vacancy, and in such case, the
designated duties of such officer, unless otherwise provided in these Bylaws,
shall be discharged by the Chief Executive Officer or such other officers as
he or she may designate.

 **ARTICLE IV.**

 

 **CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES AND THEIR TRANSFER**

 



 

4.01. _ Stock Certificates and Facsimile Signatures._ The certificates for
shares of stock of the corporation shall be signed either manually or by
facsimile signature by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice
President, and by the Corporate Secretary or an Assistant Corporate Secretary
of the corporation, or any other officer or officers that the Board of
Directors designates, and may be sealed with the seal of the corporation.

 



 

The certificates for shares shall be countersigned and registered either
manually or by facsimile signature in such manner, if any, as the Board of
Directors may from time to time prescribe. The transfer agent and the
registrar may, but need not be, the same person or agency. In the event that
the corporation or its agent is acting in the dual capacity of transfer agent
and registrar, a single manual or facsimile signature may be used.

 



 

In case any such person acting as an officer, transfer agent or registrar, who
has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such
certificate, shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or
registrar, before such certificate is issued, it may be used by the
corporation with the same effect as if such person had not ceased to be such
at the date of its issue.

 



 

4.02. _ Transfer of Stock._ The shares of stock of the corporation shall be
transferable on the books of the corporation upon request by the holders
thereof or by duly authorized attorney, upon surrender and cancellation of
certificates for a like number of shares of the same class and series of
stock, with duly executed assignment and power of transfer endorsed thereon or
attached thereto, and with such proof of the authenticity of the signature as
the corporation or its agents may reasonably require.

 



 

Prior to due presentment of a certificate for shares for registration of
transfer the corporation may treat the registered owner of such shares as the
person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notifications and otherwise to
have and exercise all the rights and powers of an owner. Where a certificate
for shares is presented to the corporation with a request to register for
transfer, the corporation shall not be liable to the owner or any other person
suffering loss as a result of such registration of transfer if (a) there were
on or with the certificate the necessary endorsements, and (b) the corporation
had no duty to inquire into adverse claims or has discharged any such duty.
The corporation may require reasonable assurance that said endorsements are
genuine and effective and in compliance with such other regulations as may be
prescribed by or under the authority of the Board of Directors.

 



 

4.03. _ Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates._ Where the owner claims that
his certificate for shares has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, a new
certificate shall be issued in place thereof if the owner (a) so requests
before the corporation has notice that such shares have been acquired by a
bona fide purchaser, (b) files with the corporation a sufficient indemnity
bond and (c) satisfies such other reasonable requirements as may be prescribed
by or under the authority of the Board of Directors.

 



      
 

 



 

4.04. _ Shares Without Certificates._ The Board of Directors may authorize the
issuance of any shares of any of its classes or series without certificates.
The authorization does not affect shares already represented by certificates
until the certificates are surrendered to the corporation. Within a reasonable
time after the issuance or transfer of shares without certificates, the
corporation shall send the stockholder a written statement that includes (1)
all of the information required on share certificates and (2) any transfer
restrictions applicable to the shares.

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE V.**

 

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

5.01. _ Mandatory Indemnification._ The corporation shall indemnify to the
fullest extent permitted by law any person who is or was a party or threatened
to be made a party to any legal proceeding by reason of the fact that such
person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another
enterprise, against expenses (including attorney fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in
connection with such legal proceeding.

 



 

5.02. _ Certain Definitions._ As used in this Article V, (a) "indemnify"

fullest extent to which indemnity may lawfully be provided by, pursuant to or
consistently with, the provisions of Sections 180.0850 to 180.0859 of the
Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (or any successor provisions) or any other
applicable law, whether statutory or otherwise, (c) "person" includes the
persons heirs, executors and administrators, (d) "legal proceeding" means any

in any capacity that involves services or duties with respect to the plan or
its participants or beneficiaries and (ii) action reasonably believed to be in
the interest of such participants or beneficiaries shall be deemed reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation.

 



 

5.03. _ Legal Enforceability._ The rights provided to any person by the terms
of this Article V shall be legally enforceable against the corporation by such
person, who shall be presumed to have relied on the provisions of this Article
V in undertaking or continuing any of the positions with the corporation or
other enterprise referred to in Section 5.01.

 



 

5.04. _ Limitation on Modification or Termination._ No modification or
termination of this Article V shall be effected which would impair any rights
hereunder arising at any time out of events occurring prior to such
modification or termination.

 



 

5.05. _ Non-Exclusive Bylaw._ This Article V is not intended to be exclusive
and accordingly shall not be construed as impairing in any way the power and
authority of the corporation, to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent legally permissible without regard to this Article V, in its discretion
to indemnify or agree to indemnify, or to purchase insurance indemnifying, any
employee, agent or other person.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI.**

 

 **OTHER INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS**

 



 

6.01. _ Indemnification for Successful Defense._ Within twenty (20) days after
receipt of a written request pursuant to Section 6.03, the corporation shall
indemnify a director or officer, to the extent he or she has been successful
on the merits or otherwise in the defense of a proceeding, for all reasonable
expenses incurred in the proceeding if the director or officer was a party
because he or she is a director or officer of the corporation.

 



 

6.02. _ Other Indemnification._ (a) In cases not included under Section 6.01,
the corporation shall indemnify a director or officer against all liabilities
and expenses incurred by the director or officer in a proceeding to which the
director or officer was a party because he or she is a director or officer of
the corporation, unless liability was incurred because the director or officer
breached or failed to perform a duty he or she owes to the corporation and the
breach or failure to perform constitutes any of the following:

 



 

(1) A willful failure to deal fairly with the corporation or its stockholders
in connection with a matter in which the director or officer has a material
conflict of interest.

 



 

(2) A violation of criminal law, unless the director or officer had
reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no

(3) A transaction from which the director or officer derived an improper
personal profit.

 



 

(4) Willful misconduct.

 



 

(b) Determination of whether indemnification is required under this Section
or Article V shall be made pursuant to Section 6.05.

 



 

(c) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or
conviction, or upon a plea of no contest or an equivalent plea, does not, by
itself, create a presumption that indemnification of the director or officer
is not required under this Section.

 



 

6.03. _ Written Request._ A director or officer who seeks indemnification
under Article V or Sections 6.01 or 6.02 shall make a written request to the
corporation.

 



 

6.04. _ Nonduplication._ The corporation shall not indemnify a director or
officer under Sections 6.01 or 6.02 if the director or officer has previously
received indemnification or allowance of expenses from any person, including
the corporation, in connection with the same proceeding. However, the director
or officer has no duty to look to any other person for indemnification.

 



      
 

 



 

6.05. _ Determination of Right to Indemnification._ (a) Unless otherwise
provided by the Articles of Incorporation or by written agreement between the
director or officer and the corporation, the director or officer seeking

following means for determining his or her right to indemnification:

 



 

(1) By a majority vote of a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of
directors not at the time parties to the same or related proceedings. If a
quorum of disinterested directors cannot be obtained, by majority vote of a
committee duly appointed by the Board of Directors and consisting solely of
two (2) or more directors who are not at the time parties to the same or
related proceedings. Directors who are parties to the same or related
proceedings may participate in the designation of members of the committee.

 



 

(2) By independent legal counsel selected by a quorum of the Board of
Directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in sub. (1) or, if unable
to obtain such a quorum or committee, by a majority vote of the full Board of
Directors, including directors who are parties to the same or related
proceedings.

 



 

(3) By a panel of three (3) arbitrators consisting of one arbitrator selected
by those directors entitled under sub. (2) to select independent legal
counsel, one arbitrator selected by the director or officer seeking
indemnification and one arbitrator selected by the two (2) arbitrators
previously selected.

 



 

(4) By an affirmative vote of shares represented at a meeting of stockholders
at which a quorum of the voting group entitled to vote thereon is present.
Shares owned by, or voted under the control of, persons who are at the time
parties to the same or related proceedings, whether as plaintiffs or
defendants or in any other capacity, may not be voted in making the
determination.

 



 

(5) By a court under Section 6.08.

 



 

(6) By any other method provided for in any additional right to
indemnification.

 



 

(b) In any determination under (a), the burden of proof is on the corporation
to prove by clear and convincing evidence that indemnification under Article V
or Section 6.02 should not be allowed.

 



 

(c) A written determination as to a directors or officers indemnification
under Article V or Section 6.02 shall be submitted to both the corporation and
the director or officer within 60 days of the selection made under (a).

 



 

(d) If it is determined that indemnification is required under Article V or
Section 6.02, the corporation shall pay all liabilities and expenses not
prohibited by Section 6.04 within ten (10) days after receipt of the written
determination under (c). The corporation shall also pay all expenses incurred
by the director or officer in the determination process under (a).

 



      
 

 



 

6.06. _ Advance of Expenses._ Within ten (10) days after receipt of a written
request by a director or officer who is a party to a proceeding, the
corporation shall pay or reimburse his or her reasonable expenses as incurred
if the director or officer provides the corporation with all of the following:

 



 

(1) A written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she has
not breached or failed to perform his or her duties to the corporation.

 



 

(2) A written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to
repay the allowance to the extent that it is ultimately determined under
Section 6.05 that indemnification under Article V or Section 6.02 is not
required and that indemnification is not ordered by a court under Section
6.08(b)(2). The undertaking under this subsection shall be an unlimited
general obligation of the director or officer and may be accepted without
reference to his or her ability to repay the allowance. The undertaking may be
secured or unsecured.

 



 

6.07. _ Limitations on Indemnification._ (a) Regardless of the existence or
rights under these Bylaws and additional rights to indemnification under any
agreement with the corporation, the corporation shall not indemnify a director
or officer, or permit a director or officer to retain any allowance of
expenses, unless it is determined by or on behalf of the corporation that the
director or officer did not breach or fail to perform a duty he or she owes to
the corporation which constitutes conduct under Section 6.02(a)(1), (2), (3)
or (4). A director or officer who is a party to the same or related
proceedings for which indemnification or an allowance of expenses is sought
may not participate in a determination under this subsection.

 



 

(b) Sections 6.01 to 6.12 do not affect the corporations power to pay or
reimburse expenses incurred by a director or officer in any of the following
circumstances.

written agreement between the director or officer and the corporation, a
director or officer who is a party to a proceeding may apply for
indemnification to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of
competent jurisdiction. Application shall be made for an initial determination
by the court under Section 6.05(a)(5) or for review by the court of an adverse
determination under Section 6.05(a) (1), (2), (3), (4) or (6). After receipt

V or Sections 6.01 or 6.02.

 



 

(2) That the director or officer is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, regardless of
whether indemnification is required under Article V or Section 6.02.

entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall pay the directors or
officers expenses incurred to obtain the court-ordered indemnification.

The corporation shall indemnify an employee of the corporation who is not a
director or officer of the corporation, to the extent that he or she has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of a proceeding, for all
reasonable expenses incurred in the proceeding if the employee was a party
because he or she was an employee of the corporation. In addition, the
corporation may indemnify and allow reasonable expenses of an employee or
agent who is not a director or officer of the corporation to the extent
provided by the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, by general or
specific action of the Board of Directors or by contract.

 



 

6.10. _ Insurance._ The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of an individual who is an employee, agent, director or officer of the
corporation against liability asserted against or incurred by the individual

expenses to the individual against the same liability under Article V or
Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.06, 6.07 and 6.09.

securities brokers or dealers, or investment companies or investment advisers.

 



 

6.12. _ Liberal Construction._ In order for the corporation to obtain and
retain qualified directors, officers and employees, the foregoing provisions
shall be liberally administered in order to afford maximum indemnification of
directors, officers and, where Section 6.09 of these Bylaws applies,
employees. The indemnification above provided for shall be granted in all
applicable cases unless to do so would clearly contravene law, controlling
precedent or public policy.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII.**

 

 **CONTRACTS, CHECKS, NOTES, BONDS, ETC.**

 



 

7.01. _ Contracts._ The Board of Directors may authorize any officer or
officers, agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute or deliver
any document or instrument, whether of conveyance or otherwise, in the name of
and on behalf of the corporation, and such authorization may be general or
confined to specific instances.

 



 

7.02. _ Checks, Drafts, Etc._ All checks and drafts on the corporations bank
accounts and all bills of exchange and promissory notes, and all acceptances,
obligations and other instruments for the payment of money, shall be signed
or, in the case of wire transfers, shall be authorized by such officer or
officers, employee or employees or agent or agents as shall be thereunto
authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors; provided that checks
drawn on the corporations bank accounts may bear the facsimile signature of
such officer or officers, employee or employees, or agent or agents as the
Board of Directors shall authorize; and provided further that in the case of
notes, bonds or debentures issued under a trust instrument of the corporation
and required to be signed by two officers of the corporation, the signatures
of either or both of such officers may be in facsimile if specifically
authorized and directed by the Board of Directors of the corporation and if
such notes, bonds or debentures are required to be authenticated by a
corporate trustee which is a party to the trust instrument. In case any such
officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such
instrument shall have ceased to be such officer before such instrument is
issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if such
officer had not ceased to be such at the date of its issue.

 **FISCAL YEAR**

 



 

The fiscal year of the corporation shall begin on the first day of January in
each year and shall end on the thirty-first day of December following.

 **CORPORATE SEAL**

 



 

The Board of Directors may provide a corporate seal which may be circular in
form and have inscribed thereon the name of the corporation and the state of
incorporation and the words "Corporate Seal."

 



 

 **ARTICLE X.**

 

 **EFFECT OF HEADINGS**

 



 

The descriptive headings and references to Articles and Sections in these
Bylaws were formulated, used and inserted herein for convenience only and

provisions hereof.

 **ARTICLE XI.**

 

 **AMENDMENTS**

 



 

11.01. _ By Stockholders._ These Bylaws may be amended or repealed and new
Bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders by the vote provided in Section 1.06
of these Bylaws except as specifically provided below or in the Articles of
Incorporation. If authorized by the Articles of Incorporation, the
stockholders may adopt or amend a Bylaw that fixes a greater or lower quorum
requirement or a greater voting requirement for stockholders or voting groups
of stockholders than otherwise is provided in the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law. The adoption or amendment of a Bylaw that adds, changes or
deletes a greater or lower quorum requirement or a greater voting requirement
for stockholders must meet the same quorum requirement and be adopted by the
same vote and voting groups required to take action under the quorum and
voting requirement then in effect.

 



 

11.02. _ By Directors._ Except as the Articles of Incorporation may otherwise
provide, these Bylaws may also be amended or repealed and new Bylaws may be
adopted by the Board of Directors by the vote provided in Sections 2.10 and
2.11, but (a) no Bylaw adopted by the stockholders shall be amended, repealed
or readopted by the Board of Directors if such Bylaw provides that it may not
be amended, repealed or readopted by the Board of Directors and (b) a Bylaw
adopted or amended by the stockholders that fixes a greater or lower quorum
requirement or a greater voting requirement for the Board of Directors than
otherwise is provided in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law may not be
amended or repealed by the Board of Directors unless the Bylaw expressly
provides that it may be amended or repealed by a specified vote of the Board
of Directors. Action by the Board of Directors to adopt or amend a Bylaw that
changes the quorum or voting requirement for the Board of Directors must meet
the same quorum requirement and be adopted by the same vote required to take
action under the quorum and voting requirement then in effect, unless a
different voting requirement is specified as provided by the preceding
sentence. A Bylaw that fixes a greater or lower quorum requirement or a
greater voting requirement for stockholders or voting groups of stockholders
than otherwise is provided in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law may not
be adopted, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors.

 



 

11.03. _ Implied Amendments._ Any action taken or authorized by the
stockholders or by the Board of Directors, which would be inconsistent with
the Bylaws then in effect but is taken or authorized by a vote that would be
sufficient to amend the Bylaws so that the Bylaws would be consistent with
such action, shall be given the same effect as though the Bylaws had been
temporarily amended or suspended so far, but only so far, as is necessary to
permit the specific action so taken or authorized.
