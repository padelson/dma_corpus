22 destroyed certificate or instrument the applicable portion of the Final

thereby. 2.10 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, those Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and are held by a Dissenting Stockholder shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Final Merger
Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such rights, such holder's
Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and
become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
portion of the Final Merger Consideration, if any, to which such holder is
entitled, without interest thereon. Purchaser shall be entitled to retain any
portion of the Final Merger Consideration not paid on account of such
Dissenting Shares pending resolution of the claims of such Dissenting
Stockholders, and the Equity Holders shall not be entitled to any portion of
such retained Final Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Purchaser:
(i) prompt notice of any demands with respect to any appraisal of Shares
received by the Company, including withdrawals of any demands, and any other
instruments or notices served or otherwise delivered pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time in connection therewith;
and (ii) the opportunity to participate (at Purchaser's own expense) in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for appraisal or
other instruments or notices. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal of Shares or offer to settle any such demands. 2.11
Letters of Transmittal. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall deliver to each Equity Holder a stock power accompanied by a
Letter of Transmittal, for use in effecting the surrender of those
certificates representing the Shares in exchange for the applicable portion of
the Final Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 2.12
Undistributed Payment Funds. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
undistributed to Equity Holders as of the date that is 270 days after the date
of this Agreement shall be delivered to Purchaser upon demand, and Equity
Holders who have not theretofore surrendered the certificates representing the
Shares shall thereafter look only to Purchaser for satisfaction of their
claims for the Final Merger Consideration payable with respect to the Shares
previously represented by such certificates without any interest thereon. 2.13
Escheat. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Purchaser nor any other Person shall be liable to any Equity Holder or to any
other Person for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar applicable Law. Any Final
Merger Consideration or other amounts  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme030.jpg) 

23 remaining unclaimed by Equity Holders three years after the Effective Time
(or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any applicable Governmental Body)
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Purchaser free and clear of any Lien. 2.14 Guaranty by Guarantor. (a)
Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Sellers (i)
the payment by Purchaser of the Final Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable by Purchaser to the Equity Holders pursuant to this Agreement
when and to the extent the same shall become due and payable, and (ii) the
performance by Purchaser of each agreement, condition, covenant, obligation
and undertaking of Purchaser under this Agreement and all agreements ancillary
thereto or executed in connection therewith, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). If
Purchaser shall fail to pay any amounts due under this Agreement when and to
the extent the same shall become due and payable, or shall fail to perform any
of the Guaranteed Obligations in the manner provided in the document giving
rise to such Guaranteed Obligation, Guarantor will, upon written demand from
the Equity Holder Representative, promptly pay or cause to be paid such amount
to the Equity Holders or to cause the performance of such Guaranteed
Obligation, as the case may be. The Guaranteed Obligations under this guaranty
shall constitute an absolute and unconditional present and continuing
guarantee of payment and performance to the extent provided herein and not of
collectability, and shall not be contingent upon any attempt by the Equity
Holders to enforce payment or performance by Purchaser. (b) The Guaranteed
Obligations under this guaranty are absolute and unconditional and shall
remain in full force and effect without regard to (i) any agreement or
modification to any of the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement
which may hereafter be made relating thereto, in each case in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, except to the extent agreed to in writing by the
Company or the Equity Holder Representative, as the case may be; (ii) any
insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation, reorganization or the like
of Guarantor or Purchaser at any time; or (iii) absence of any notice to, or
knowledge by, Guarantor of the existence or occurrence of any of the matters
or events set forth in the foregoing subdivisions (i) and (ii). Guarantor
shall directly and unconditionally assume all payment and performance
Guaranteed Obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement or otherwise. (c)
Guarantor unconditionally waives (i) any and all notice of default, non-
performance or non-payment under this Agreement and (ii) all notices which may
be required by statute, rule of law or otherwise to preserve intact any rights
of the Equity Holders against Guarantor, including, any demand, presentment or
protest, or proof of notice of non- payment under this Agreement. ARTICLE III

Transmittal duly completed and delivered to the Company at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, together with appropriate documentation, into

25 (e) At the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, pay the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent for

Payment Agent cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amount payable pursuant
to Section 3.1(b). The aggregate amount of cash so deposited with the Payment
Agent, together with any amounts deposited pursuant to Section 3.3(b) is
referred to as the "Payment Fund." The Payment Agent will be instructed to
invest the funds included in the Payment Fund not otherwise distributed
pursuant to Section 3.1(b) in a cash balance money market deposit account
only. Any interest or other income resulting from the investment of such funds
shall be the property of, and will be paid to, Purchaser. (l) In calculating
the consideration payable under this Section 3.1, the Payment Agent, Purchaser
and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on the representations and warranties
contained in Section 5.4 and the Closing Certificate. Notwithstanding anything
else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the
aggregate Final Merger Consideration payable by Purchaser, Merger Sub,
Guarantor or the Surviving Corporation to the holders of equity interests in
the Company (including the holders of Company Options and Company Warrants) in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
exceed such consideration payable in accordance with this Article III assuming
such representations, warranties and Closing Certificate are correct (taking
into account any post-Closing adjustment under Section 3.2). 3.2 Purchase
Price Adjustments. (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than seventy-
five (75) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared
and delivered to Equity Holder  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme033.jpg) 

26 Representative the Closing Statement. The preparation of the Closing
Statement shall be for the sole purpose of determining differences in (i)
Final Cash from Estimated Cash and (ii) Final Net Working Capital from
Estimated Net Working Capital. (b) If the Equity Holder Representative
disagrees with Purchaser's calculation of Cash or Closing Net Working Capital
delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(a), the Equity Holder Representative may,
within thirty (30) Business Days after delivery of the Closing Statement,
deliver a notice to Purchaser stating that the Equity Holder Representative
disagrees with such calculation and specifying in reasonable detail those
items or amounts as to which the Equity Holder Representative disagrees and
the basis therefor. (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered
pursuant to Section 3.2(b), the Equity Holder Representative and Purchaser
shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Cash and/or
Closing Net Working Capital. If, during such period, the Equity Holder
Representative and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they shall
promptly thereafter engage the Independent Accountant and cause the
Independent Accountant to review this Agreement and the disputed items or
amounts for the purpose of calculating Cash and/or Closing Net Working Capital
(it being understood that in making such calculation, the Independent
Accountant shall (x) be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator and
(y) shall not have any authority to interpret any provision of this Section
3.2 or any other provision of this Agreement). Each of Purchaser and the
Equity Holder Representative agree that it and each of its Affiliates shall
not engage, or agree to engage the Independent Accountant to perform any
services other than as the Independent Accountant pursuant hereto until the
Closing Statement and Final Cash and Final Net Working Capital have been
finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.2; provided that this shall not
prohibit a portfolio company of the ACAS Parties from engaging the Independent
Accountant in the ordinary course operation of the business of such portfolio
companies. Each of Purchaser and the Equity Holder Representative agrees to
execute, if requested by the Independent Accountant, a reasonable engagement
letter. If either the Purchaser or the Equity Holder Representative shall fail
to enter into such an engagement letter within ten (10) Business Days after it
is first proposed by the Independent Accountant, the other party may enter
into such letter and bind both the Purchaser and the Equity Holder
Representative so long as their obligations and rights thereunder are
substantially the same. Purchaser and the Equity Holder Representative shall
cooperate with the Independent Accountant and promptly (but in any event on
such timetable as the Independent Accountant shall promulgate) provide all
documents and information reasonably requested by the Independent Accountant.
In making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall consider only
those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and the Purchaser's
calculation of Cash and Closing Net Working Capital as to which the Equity
Holder Representative has disagreed in its notice of disagreement duly
delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(b) and may not assign a value greater than
the greatest positive or negative adjustment requested by a party and in no
event shall Final Cash or Final Net Working Capital be less than Purchaser's
calculation of Cash or Closing Net Working Capital delivered pursuant to
Section 3.2(a) or more than the Equity Holder Representative's calculation of
Cash or Closing Net Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(b). The
Independent Accountant shall deliver to the Equity Holder Representative and
Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than thirty
(30) days from the date of engagement of the Independent Accountant),  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme034.jpg) 

27 a report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and
binding upon the Equity Holder Representative, the Equity Holders and
Purchaser, shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is binding on
Purchaser, the Equity Holder Representative and the Equity Holders, and none
of Purchaser, the Equity Holder Representative or the Equity Holders shall
seek further recourse to courts or other tribunals, other than to enforce such
report. Judgment may be entered to enforce such report in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be allocated to and borne by the Equity Holders (with the
amount to be borne by the Equity Holders to be borne in accordance with their
respective Ownership Percentages) and Purchaser based on the inverse of the
percentage that the Independent Accountant's determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Independent Accountant. For example, should the
items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Independent Accountant
awards $600 in favor of the Equity Holder's position, 60% of the costs of its
review would be borne by Purchaser and 40% of the costs would be borne by the
Equity Holders. (d) The Equity Holder Representative, Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause their respective representatives
to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the
calculation of Cash and Closing Net Working Capital and in the conduct of the
review referred to in this Section 3.2 (including Section 3.2(c)), including
the making available to the extent reasonably requested of books, records,
work papers and personnel. (e) Upon determination of Final Cash and Final Net
Working Capital, Purchaser and the Equity Holder Representative shall
determine Final Merger Consideration. If Final Merger Consideration exceeds
Initial Merger Consideration, Purchaser shall pay to the Equity Holder
Representative, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 3.2(f),
the amount of such excess. If Initial Merger Consideration exceeds Final
Merger Consideration, Purchaser shall be paid first from the Holdback Amount,
in the manner as provided in Section 3.2(f), the amount of such excess. If the
Initial Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger Consideration in an
amount greater than the Holdback Amount, the Purchaser shall be paid (i) the
Holdback Amount plus, (ii) from the Escrow Account, the difference of (A) the
Initial Merger Consideration minus (B) the Final Merger Consideration minus
(C) the Holdback Amount, in the manner as provided in Section 3.2(f). (f) Any
payment pursuant to Section 3.2(e) shall be made at a mutually convenient time
and place within five (5) Business Days after Final Merger Consideration has
been determined by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Any payment
by Purchaser shall be made to the Equity Holder Representative and shall be
received by the Equity Holder Representative on behalf of the Equity Holders
and shall thereafter be distributed by the Equity Holder Representative to the
Equity Holders in accordance with their respective Ownership Percentages (less
any amounts required to be withheld pursuant to applicable federal, state and
local withholding Laws). With respect to any payment to be made to Purchaser
from the Holdback Amount, the Equity Holder Representative, as agent on behalf
of the Equity Holders, shall make any such payment to Purchaser in accordance
with Section 3.2(e). With respect to any payment to be made to Purchaser from
the Escrow Account, the Equity Holder Representative, as agent on behalf of
the Equity Holders, shall direct and cause the Escrow Agent to make any such
payment to Purchaser in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, subject to the  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme035.jpg) 

28 Section 3.3(a). All payments under this Section 3.2 shall be without
interest, except that any amounts not paid when required by this Section 3.2
shall bear interest from the date due pursuant to this Section 3.2(f) to, and
including, the date of payment at the Interest Rate. Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed. 3.3 Escrow and Holdback Arrangements. (a) On the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall pay the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer to
the Escrow Account of immediately available funds in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. Each Equity Holder shall be deemed to have a subaccount in
the Escrow Account in an amount equal to such Equity Holder's Ownership
Percentage of the Escrow Amount (the "Escrow Subaccount"). Any payment to be
made by or on behalf of the Equity Holders pursuant to Section 3.2(f), Section
10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b) shall be paid by release of funds to the Purchaser
or Purchaser Indemnified Party (as the case may be) from the Escrow Amount by
the Escrow Agent within five (5) Business Days after the date joint notice of
any sums due and owing is given by Purchaser and the Equity Holder
Representative or pursuant to a final and non-appealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction, and shall accordingly reduce the Escrow Amount.
Payment from the Escrow Account in respect of claims pursuant to Section
10.2(a) shall be made from each Equity Holder's Escrow Subaccount in an amount
equal to such Equity Holder's Ownership Percentage of such indemnified Loss;
provided that no recovery shall be made from the Escrow Account in respect of
any Equity Holder's Ownership Percentage of an indemnifiable Loss once such
Equity Holder's Escrow Subaccount has been reduced to zero. Payment from the
Escrow Amount in respect of claims pursuant to Section 10.2(b) for which an
Equity Holder is responsible for a Loss shall be paid from such Equity
Holder's Escrow Subaccount to the extent of amounts therein. (b) Following the
determination of the Final Cash and Final Net Working Capital and the payment,
if any, from the Holdback Amount pursuant to Section 3.2(e) (or the
determination pursuant to Section 3.2(e) that no such payment from the
Holdback Amount is required), the Equity Holder Representative shall promptly
pay to the Payment Agent (on behalf of each of the Equity Holders) the
remaining balance of the Holdback Amount, if any, to the Payment Agent in
accordance with Section 3.2(e) and Section 3.2(f) for further distribution by
the Payment Agent to each of the Equity Holders (less any amount required to
be withheld pursuant to applicable federal, state and local withholding Laws)
that has delivered a Letter of Transmittal to the Payment Agent an amount
equal to the product of (i) the respective Equity Holder's Ownership
Percentage and (ii) the Holdback Amount minus such amount as was paid out of
the Holdback Amount, if any, to the Purchaser in accordance with Section
3.2(e) and Section 3.2(f). Notwithstanding any other terms herein the Holdback
Amount may not be used for any other payment obligations herein other than to
satisfy the Equity Holders' obligations to the Purchaser under Section 3.2(e)
and Section 3.2(f). (c) Following the latest to occur of (i) the making of any
payment required to be made by or to Purchaser as provided under Section 3.2
(or the determination pursuant to Section 3.2 that no such payment is
required) and (ii) the final distribution of all applicable amounts pursuant
to Section 3.3(a) that the Equity Holders shall be obligated to indemnify
pursuant to Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b) (provided, that if, on the
Expiration Date, no claim  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme036.jpg) 

29 for indemnification under Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b) by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties has been made and remains outstanding, then the
date for purposes of this clause (ii) shall be the first day following such
Expiration Date), Purchaser and the Equity Holder Representative shall jointly
and promptly direct the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Equity Holder
Representative, for distribution by the Equity Holder Representative to the
Equity Holders in accordance with the amount remaining in each such Equity
Holder's respective Escrow Subaccount (less any amounts required to be
withheld pursuant to applicable federal, state and local withholding Laws), in
each case the remainder of the Escrow Amount. If, on the Expiration Date,
either or both of (A) a dispute remains regarding any payment required to be
made to Purchaser as provided under Section 3.2(f) or (B) an indemnification
claim or claims has been made by a Purchaser Indemnified Party under Section
10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b) and such claim(s) remain outstanding on such date,
but in the case of both (A) and (B) Purchaser's good faith estimate of the
amount of indemnification to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are
entitled in respect of such disputes and claim(s) is less than the remainder
of the Escrow Amount on such date, then Purchaser and the Equity Holder
Representative shall jointly and promptly direct the Escrow Agent to
distribute to the Equity Holder Representative, for distribution by the Equity
Holder Representative to the Equity Holders in accordance with the amount
remaining in each such Equity Holder's respective Escrow Subaccount (less any
amount required to be withheld pursuant to applicable federal, state and local
withholding Laws), an amount from the Escrow Account equal to (x) such
remainder of the Escrow Amount on such date minus (y) such good faith estimate
of the amount of indemnification to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
are entitled in respect of such disputes and claim(s). Thereafter, as Section
3.2 disputes, indemnification claims and application of the Escrow Amount to
the applicable obligations hereunder become no longer applicable, Purchaser
and the Equity Holder Representative shall jointly and promptly direct the
Escrow Agent to distribute to the Equity Holder Representative, for
distribution by the Equity Holder Representative to the Equity Holders in
accordance with the amount remaining in each such Equity Holder's respective
Escrow Subaccount (less any amount required to be withheld pursuant to
applicable federal, state and local withholding Laws) such applicable amounts
from the Escrow Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Equity Holder
Representative shall report and withhold any Taxes as it determines may be
required by any Law or regulation in effect at the time of any distribution.
For the avoidance of doubt, despite having amounts so withheld, any Equity
Holders subject to withholding shall be treated as though they had received
the full amounts to which they were otherwise entitled under this Section
3.3(b). 3.4 Administrative Expense Account. The Equity Holder Representative
shall hold the Aggregate Administrative Expense Amount in the Administrative
Expense Account as a fund from which the Equity Holder Representative shall
pay any fees, expenses or costs it incurs in performing its duties and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Company Documents (including
the Escrow Agreement and the Letters of Transmittal) by or on behalf of the
Equity Holders, including fees and expenses incurred pursuant to the
procedures and provisions set forth in Sections 3.2 and 10.4 and Article XI
and legal and consultant fees, expenses and costs for reviewing, analyzing and
defending any claim or process arising under or pursuant to this Agreement.
Payments may be drawn by the Equity Holder Representative in respect of the
Administrative Expense Percentage of each Equity Holder's liability for such
fees, expenses and costs, provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that each
Equity Holder (including the ACAS Parties) shall bear any such fees, expenses
and costs in accordance with such Equity Holder's Ownership Percentage. Any
payments made from the Administrative Expense Account  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme037.jpg) 

30 shall reduce the portion of the Aggregate Administrative Expense Amount
contributed by each Equity Holder to the Administrative Expense Account in
accordance with its Administrative Expense Percentage. Following the latest to
occur of (i) the making of any payment required to be made by or to Purchaser
as provided under Section 3.2(e) (or the determination pursuant to Section
3.2(e) that no such payment is required) and (ii) the final distribution of
all applicable amounts pursuant to Section 3.3(a) that the Equity Holders
shall be obligated to indemnify pursuant to Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b)
(provided that if on the Expiration Date no claim for indemnification under
Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b) by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties has
been made and remains outstanding, then the date for purposes of this clause
(ii) shall be the first day following such Expiration Date), the Equity Holder
Representative shall distribute to each Equity Holder the remainder of such
Equity Holder's contribution to the Aggregate Administrative Expense Amount
from the Administrative Expense Account. The Equity Holder Representative
shall report and withhold any Taxes as it determines may be required by any
Law or regulation in effect at the time of any distribution. 3.5 Tax Treatment
of Payments. Any payments made with respect to adjustments made pursuant to
Section 3.2 and any indemnity payments made pursuant to Article X shall be
deemed to be, and each of the Equity Holders and the Purchaser shall treat
such payments as, an adjustment to the Final Merger Consideration for federal,
state, local and foreign income Tax purposes to the extent permitted by Law.
3.6 Tax Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable to the Sellers under this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith
under the Code or any provision of Law relating to Taxes, as determined by
Purchaser and all such withheld amounts shall be remitted to the applicable
Taxing Authorities promptly following the date of payment. Despite having
amounts so withheld, the applicable Option Holders and Warrant Holders shall
be treated as though they had received the full amounts to which they are
otherwise entitled. ARTICLE IV CLOSING AND TERMINATION 4.1 Closing Date. The
Closing shall take place by electronic mail and overnight courier service, or
by physical exchange of documentation at the offices of American Capital, Ltd.

31 4.2 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated on any date
prior to the Closing as follows: (a) at the election of the Company or
Purchaser on or after December 31, 2013 (the "Termination Date"), if the
Closing shall not have occurred by the close of business on such date,
provided that the terminating party is not in breach in any material respect
of any of its obligations hereunder; (b) by mutual written consent of the
Company and Purchaser; (c) by the Company or Purchaser if there shall be in
effect a final non-appealable Order of a Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby; it being agreed that, subject to the
last sentence of Section 8.4(b) hereof, the parties hereto shall promptly
appeal any adverse determination which is not non-appealable (and pursue such
appeal with reasonable diligence); provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 4.2(c) shall not be available to a
party if such Order was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform
any of its obligations under this Agreement; (d) by the Company, if the
Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement, if (i) any of the
representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall
be inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement, or shall have become
inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement, such that
the condition set forth in Section 9.2(a) would not be satisfied; or (ii) any
of the covenants of Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall have been
breached such that the condition set forth in Section 9.2(b) would not be
satisfied; provided, however, that if an inaccuracy in any of the
representations and warranties of Purchaser as of a date subsequent to the
date of this Agreement or a breach of a covenant by Purchaser is curable by
Purchaser within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Company notifies
Purchaser in writing of the existence of such inaccuracy or breach (the
"Purchaser Cure Period"), then the Company may not terminate this Agreement
under this Section 4.2(d) as a result of such inaccuracy or breach prior to
the expiration of the Purchaser Cure Period, provided that Purchaser, during
the Purchaser Cure Period, continues to exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach (it being understood that the
Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.2(d) with
respect to such inaccuracy or breach if such inaccuracy or breach is cured
prior to the expiration of the Purchaser Cure Period); or (e) by Purchaser, if
the Purchaser is not then in material breach of this Agreement, if (i) any of
the representations and warranties of Sellers or the Company contained in this
Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement, or shall have
become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement, such
that the condition set forth in Section 9.1(a) would not be satisfied; (ii)
any of the covenants of Sellers or the Company contained in this Agreement
shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 9.1(b)
would not be satisfied; or (iii) any Material Adverse Effect shall have
occurred, or any event or other change, event, effect, claim, circumstance or
matter shall have occurred or any change, event, effect, claim, circumstance
or matter shall exist that, in combination with any other changes, events,
effects, claims, circumstances or matters that have occurred or shall exist,  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme039.jpg) 

32 would reasonably be expected to have or result in a Material Adverse
Effect; provided, however, that, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) only, if
an inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of Sellers or the
Company as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement or a breach of a
covenant by Sellers or the Company is curable by the applicable Person within
fifteen (15) Business Days after Purchaser notifies the Company in writing of
the existence of such inaccuracy or breach (the "Company Cure Period"), then
Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 4.2(e) as a
result of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the expiration of the Company
Cure Period, provided that the applicable party, during the Company Cure
Period, continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
inaccuracy or breach (it being understood that Purchaser may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.2(e) with respect to such inaccuracy
or breach if such inaccuracy or breach is cured prior to the expiration of the
Company Cure Period). 4.3 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of
termination and abandonment by Purchaser or the Company, as applicable,
pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be
given to the other party or parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and
the Merger shall be abandoned, without further action by Purchaser, Merger
Sub, the Company or the Sellers. 4.4 Effect of Termination. (a) In the event
that this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Sections 4.2 and
4.3, then, except as provided in this Section 4.4, Section 8.6, Section 8.10
and Article XII, each of the parties shall be relieved of their duties and
obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of such termination
and such termination shall be without liability to Purchaser, Merger Sub, the
Company or any Seller; provided that all obligations of the parties set forth
in Section 4.4(b) and the Confidentiality Agreement, including the
restrictions on Purchaser's ability to solicit personnel of the Company, shall
be extended to a period of three (3) years from the date of this Agreement.
(b) During the period from the date hereof through the earlier of (i) the
Closing and (ii) the date that is three (3) years following the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof, Purchaser shall not directly or
indirectly, through any Affiliate, officer, director, agent or otherwise,
solicit the employment of or employ or retain as a consultant any employee of
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries who is a management or key employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary as of the date hereof or at any time during such
period (provided that the solicitation or hiring of such employees (A) through
the use of general solicitations, including through media advertisements, job
boards or employment search firms in the ordinary course of business that are
not targeted at such employees, (B) if such employee's employment has been
terminated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C) if such
employee's employment has been terminated by the employee if neither
Purchaser, nor any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, solicited such
person except pursuant to a general solicitation which was not directed
specifically to any such employee, shall be deemed not to violate the
foregoing provisions). Furthermore, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 4.2 hereof (other than due to a breach by the Sellers or the
Company), Purchaser shall not oppose or seek to prevent or frustrate any
transaction or agreement that the Company or any of the Subsidiaries may
propose or enter into relating to the sale of all or any portion of the
Company to any third party. Nothing in this Section 4.4(b) is intended to, nor
shall it be construed as, a waiver or  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme040.jpg) 

33 discharge of any of the rights and obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement of the parties thereto. (c) Nothing in this Section 4.4 shall
relieve the Sellers, Purchaser or Merger Sub of any liability for a breach of
any of its covenants or agreements or Willful Breach of its representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement prior to the date of termination.
The damages recoverable by the non-breaching party shall include all
attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by such party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. ARTICLE V REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

commencing immediately after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, the Subsidiaries and any of their successors or assigns
to, indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
individuals who  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme064.jpg) 

57 on or prior to the Closing Date were directors or officers of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnitees") with respect to
all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the
request of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries at any time prior to the
Closing Date. Purchaser agrees, for and on behalf of itself and the Surviving
Corporation, the Subsidiaries or any of their successors or assigns, that all
rights of the Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in
the respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable
organizational documents of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries as now in
effect, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be
amended, or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of the Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In
addition, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
any expenses of any Indemnitee under this Section 8.7, as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it shall ultimately be determined that such officer or director is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. (b)
Purchaser, from and after the Closing Date, shall cause (i) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions
no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of certain
liabilities of directors, officers, employees and agents and indemnification
than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Company and (ii) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws or comparable organizational documents of each
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to contain the current provisions
regarding indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents which
provisions in each case shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees. (c) Each of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnitee shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense of any Legal Proceeding as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith. (d) For the six-year period commencing
immediately after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain,
and Purchaser shall cause the Company to maintain, in effect the directors'
and officers' liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date (such
coverage to be on terms and conditions and for an amount not materially less
favorable to the Company's and the Subsidiaries' directors and officers
currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the
date hereof). (e) The provisions of this Section 8.7: (i) are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract or otherwise. (f) In the event that the
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme065.jpg) 

58 the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary (as the case may be) shall
assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 8.7. (g) The
obligations of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, each Subsidiary or any of
their successors or assigns under this Section 8.7 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this
Section 8.7 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 8.7 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.7). (h) Purchaser and Merger
Sub hereby acknowledge that the Indemnitees may have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by ACAS and
its Affiliates (other than the Company and Subsidiaries) (collectively, the
"ACAS Indemnitors"). Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby agree that from and after
the Closing Date (i) the Surviving Corporation, the Subsidiaries and any of
their successors or assigns are the indemnitors of first resort (i.e., its
obligations to Indemnitees are primary and any obligation of the ACAS
Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by any Indemnitee are secondary), (ii) the
Surviving Corporation, the Subsidiaries and any of their successors or assigns
shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by any
Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments,
penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent legally
permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement and the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary (or
any other agreement between the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary and
any Indemnitee), without regard to any rights an Indemnitee may have against
the ACAS Indemnitors and (iii) it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and
releases the ACAS Indemnitors from any and all claims against the ACAS
Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in
respect thereof. Purchaser and Merger Sub further agree that no advancement or
payment by the ACAS Indemnitors on behalf of an Indemnitee with respect to any
claim for which an Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Surviving
Corporation shall affect the foregoing and the ACAS Indemnitors shall have a
right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement
or payment to all of the rights of recovery of an Indemnitee against the
Surviving Corporation. Purchaser and Merger Sub agree that the ACAS
Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section
8.7(h). (i) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this
Section 8.7 shall not override or otherwise impair a Purchaser Indemnified
Party's right to seek indemnification in accordance with Article X, and, if
any Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under
Article X (without regard to the limitations contained in Article X) with
respect to the same matter, no Indemnitee will be entitled to be exculpated,
indemnified or reimbursed, or receive advancement of any expenses, under the
organizational documents of the Company, the Subsidiaries or Purchaser, this
Agreement or otherwise, with respect to such matter.  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme066.jpg) 

59 8.8 Pre-Closing Estimates. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser (i) Payoff Letters,
signed by an authorized officer, specifying the Debt Payoff Amounts as of
Closing, along with evidence of the release and discharge of all Liens
relating to Indebtedness set forth on Schedule 1.2, (ii) the Closing
Certificate, and (iii) the Estimated Closing Statement. 8.9 Preservation of
Records. Purchaser agrees that it shall, and Purchaser agrees that it shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to preserve and keep the records held by it,
them or their Affiliates relating to the respective businesses of the Company
and the Subsidiaries for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date and
shall make such records and personnel available to the Equity Holder
Representative, during regular business hours upon reasonable advance notice
and under reasonable circumstances, as may be reasonably required by the
Equity Holder Representative in connection with any insurance claims, legal
proceedings or Tax audits against or governmental investigations of the
Sellers, Equity Holder Representative or any of their Affiliates, any
evaluation of any claim for indemnification hereunder or in order to enable
the Sellers and Equity Holder Representative to comply with their respective
obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document or
instrument contemplated hereby. The Equity Holder Representative shall be
entitled, to make copies of such records to which it is entitled to access
pursuant to this Section 8.9. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no such investigation or examination shall be permitted to the extent that it
would result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or conflict with any
confidentiality obligations to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is
bound. In the event the Purchaser wishes to destroy such records prior to that
time, Purchaser shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to the
Equity Holder Representative and the Equity Holder Representative shall have
the right at its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to
Purchaser within that ninety (90) day period, to take possession of the
records within one-hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice.
8.10 Publicity. (a) None of the Sellers, the Company or Purchaser shall issue
any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval
of Purchaser and the Equity Holder Representative, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers,
the Company and Purchaser may issue any press release or public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby if, in the
sole judgment of the Company, the Equity Holder Representative or Purchaser,
as applicable, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the
applicable rules of any stock exchange on which the Sellers, the Company or
Purchaser lists securities, provided that, to the extent required by
applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult
with the other party with respect to the timing and content thereof. (b)
Except for communications and disclosures required in connection with
obtaining the necessary consents, approvals, Payoff Letters, financing and
other documentation to satisfy the conditions to Closing or necessary to
implement the provisions of this Agreement, each of Purchaser, the Company and
the Sellers agree that the terms of this Agreement shall not be  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme067.jpg) 

60 disclosed or otherwise made available to the public, except where the
disclosure, availability or filing of such terms or this Agreement is required
by, or advisable under, applicable Law. (c) Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Section 8.10 to the contrary, the ACAS Parties and their duly
authorized representatives may disclose the terms of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby in a manner consistent with such Person's
past disclosure practices in connection with its dispositions of portfolio
investments without the prior written agreement of any party hereto, provided
that the party intending to make such release shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with Purchaser with respect to the timing and
content thereof. 8.11 Employment and Employee Benefits. (a) Employees.
Purchaser covenants and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to continue the employment of the employees of the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries who remain employed immediately prior to and
following the Closing at no less than the same salary or hourly wage rate in
effect immediately prior to the Closing until December 31, 2014; provided that
nothing in this Section 8.11(a) shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee (as defined
below) during such period. Such individuals who continue their employment with
Purchaser following the Closing Date are hereinafter referred to as the
"Continuing Employees." (b) Benefits. (i) Purchaser shall cause to be
maintained for each of the Continuing Employees until December 31, 2014, or
such longer period of time as is required by Law, benefit plans, programs,
arrangements and policies that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company Benefit Plans, programs, arrangements and policies of the Company
provided to such employees as of the Closing Date (other than equity
compensation and severance arrangements); provided that nothing in this
Section 8.11(b) shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
continue the employment of any Continuing Employee during such period. (ii)
For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under the
employee benefit plans of Purchaser providing benefits to Continuing Employees
(the "Purchaser Plans"), Purchaser shall credit each Continuing Employee with
his or her years of service with the Company, the Subsidiaries and any
predecessor entities, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service under any
similar Company Benefit Plan. The Purchaser Plans shall not deny Continuing
Employees coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions and, in the event
Purchaser moves employees to different benefit programs prior to January 1,
2015, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to credit such Continuing
Employees for any deductibles paid under an applicable Company Benefits Plan
in the year of initial participation in the Purchaser Plans (unless such
Continuing Employees become eligible for the applicable Purchaser Plans on the
first day of a year).  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme068.jpg) 

61 (c) COBRA. Purchaser shall cause continuation coverage under the COBRA to
be provided to each individual who is or becomes an "MandA qualified
beneficiary" (as defined in Treas. Reg. § 54-4980B-9) in connection with the
occurrence of the Merger to the extent elected by such individual. (d) WARN.
For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries to, provide any required notice
under the WARN Act, or any similar law, and to otherwise comply with any such
Law with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the
WARN Act or similar Law) or similar event affecting the employees of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. (e) Deferred Compensation
Plan. No later than the Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall take all action necessary to terminate the DelStar Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") and to cause all benefits
under the Deferred Compensation Plan to be paid, all in accordance with
Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B). Each Continuing Employee who was
eligible for the Deferred Compensation Plan as of the date of this Agreement
will be eligible to participate in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
maintained by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates effective as the later of (i)
January 1, 2014, and (ii) as promptly as administratively practicable
following the Closing. (f) 280G. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
submit to its stockholders for approval (in a manner satisfactory to
Purchaser) by such number of holders of Shares as is required pursuant to
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that the
Company and Purchaser reasonably determine may, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such that such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code and that the deduction of such payments and/or
benefits will not be limited by the application of Section 280G of the Code
and the applicable regulations thereunder. The Company will provide Purchaser
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all calculations and
documents prepared in connection with the foregoing and will make such
modifications thereto as are reasonable requested by Purchaser. (g) No Third
Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third
party beneficiary rights in any employee or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in any other Person that is not a party
to this Agreement. Nothing herein shall constitute or shall be construed as an
amendment to, the establishment of, or as precluding or requiring the
amendment or termination of, any particular Company Benefit Plan or other
employee benefit plan or arrangement. 8.12 Control of Business. Purchaser
acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its and their
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives,
successors and assigns that the operation of the Company remains in the
dominion and control of the Company until the Closing and that until the
Closing none of the foregoing Persons will contact or otherwise communicate
with any director, officer or employee of the Company in  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme069.jpg) 

62 connection with or regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, except
as specifically contemplated or permitted by this Article VIII or as otherwise
consented to in advance by an officer of the Company; provided, that Purchaser
will be entitled to maintain communication and contact with any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary with whom it has had
authorized contact prior to the date hereof. 8.13 Jointly Privileged
Information. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, prior to
the Closing, ACAS and each other Seller shall be permitted to make photocopies
of any email, document and other records of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries containing attorney-client privileged information where the
attorney-client privilege is held jointly between one or more of the Company
and any Subsidiary on the one hand, and any of the ACAS Parties or any such
other Sellers on the other hand ("Jointly Privileged Information"). From and
after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary to
provide to ACAS and each such other Seller all copies (including electronic,
digital, or otherwise) of any Jointly Privileged Information requested by ACAS
or such other Seller that is inadvertently not copied prior to the Closing.
ACAS and each such other Seller agrees that any photocopies made of any email,
document and other record pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 8.13
shall be returned to the Company promptly following the determination by ACAS
or such other Seller that such email, document or other record does not
contain Jointly Privileged Information. 8.14 Notification. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of any event,
condition, fact or circumstance (a) that would make the timely satisfaction of
any of the conditions set forth in Article IX impossible or unlikely, (b)
which, if existing or occurring prior to the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth in a Schedule hereto, or (c) which would
have been required to be set forth in a Schedule hereto if the Knowledge of
the Company on the Closing Date were the Knowledge of the Company on the date
hereof. No such notification shall be deemed to supplement or amend the
Disclosure Schedule in any respect for the purpose of: (i) determining the
accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by the Company or
any Seller in this Agreement; or (ii) determining whether any of the
conditions set forth in Article IX has been satisfied. 8.15 Related Party
Accounts and Agreements. On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to: (a) cancel all loans or other accounts
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
Related Person, on the other hand; (b) terminate the Stockholders Agreement;
(c) terminate the Investment Banking Agreement; and (d) take all actions
necessary to terminate all rights and obligations under all Contracts,
business relationships or commitments between the Company or its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any Related Person, on the other hand (together with the
Stockholders Agreement and the Investment Banking Agreement, the "Related
Party Agreements"). Following the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of
its Affiliates (including Purchaser and its Affiliates), on the one hand, nor
any Seller or any other Related Person, on the other hand, shall have any
Liability to the other with respect to any Related Party Agreement 8.16
Release. Each Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (collectively for
purposes of this Section 8.16, the "Releasing Parties") hereby consents to the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and each other agreement,
document or instrument referred  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme070.jpg) 

63 to in or contemplated by this Agreement. Effective as of the Closing, each
of the Releasing Parties hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and completely
releases, acquits and forever discharges each of the Releasees (as defined
below) from and against any and all Claims, whether at law or in equity, that
such Releasing Party may have had in the past, may now have or may have in the
future against any of the Releasees, directly or indirectly relating to or
arising out of any events, matters, causes, things, acts, omissions or conduct
occurring or existing at any time up to and including the Closing Date or
relating directly or indirectly to such Releasing Party's current or former
employment or consulting relationship with the Company or its Subsidiaries or
current or former status as a director, stockholder, optionholder,
warrantholder or debtholder of the Company or its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that such Releasing Party is not releasing (i) any rights available
to it under this Agreement or any agreement entered into by such Releasing
Party in connection with the Closing or (ii) if (and only if) Seller is an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any claims made
under directors' and officers' liability insurance policies or (iii) if (and
only if) Seller is a Continuing Employee, any claims for accrued cash
compensation and benefits and reimbursement of business expenses in the
Ordinary Course of Business. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) "Releasees"
means the Company, the Subsidiaries, Purchaser, and all of Purchaser's
Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, members, affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and
assigns, and (b) "Claim" means and includes all past, present and future
disputes, claims, controversies, demands, rights, obligations, liabilities,
actions and causes of action of every kind and nature, including: (i) any
unknown, inchoate, unsuspected or undisclosed claim; and (ii) any claim, right
or cause of action based upon any breach of any express, implied, oral or
written contract or agreement. 8.17 Certain Restrictive Covenants. During the
period from the date hereof through the date that is two (2) years following
the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), each Seller shall not, directly or
indirectly, as agent, employee, consultant, distributor, representative,
stockholder, manager, partner or in any other capacity: (a) employ or engage,
or recruit or solicit for employment or engagement any employee of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries who is an Equity Holder (provided that the
solicitation or hiring of such employees (i) through the use of general
solicitations, including through media advertisements, job boards or
employment search firms in the ordinary course of business that are not
targeted at such employees, or (ii) if such employee has ceased to be employed
or retained by the Company or its Subsidiaries for at least six (6) months
prior to such solicitation or hiring, shall be deemed not to violate the
foregoing provisions); or (b) make (or cause to be made) to any Person any
disparaging or derogatory or otherwise negative or false comments or
statements concerning the Company, the Subsidiaries or Purchaser, or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, partners, shareholders or
agents (or any of their products or services or respective business reputation
or personal reputation). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in
Section 8.17 shall prohibit an ACAS Party portfolio company from, at any time
during the Restricted Period, without use of any confidential or proprietary
information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, soliciting or hiring
any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that,
during the Restricted  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme071.jpg) 

64 Period, (1) the ACAS Parties shall not cause their respective portfolio
companies to hire Mark Abrahams; and (2) the ACAS Parties shall cause Dustin
Smith not to hire any employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries who
is an Equity Holder. 8.18 Restrictions on Competition and Interference. During
the Restricted Period, each Seller listed on Schedule 8.18 shall not, directly
or indirectly, through any Affiliate, officer, director, agent or otherwise:
(a) interfere or attempt to interfere with the relationship of the Company,
its Subsidiaries, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates with any
Specified Business Contact, or encourage, induce, attempt to induce, solicit
or attempt to solicit (on his, her or its own behalf or on behalf of any other
Person) any Specified Business Contact to terminate or adversely modify its
business relationship with the Company, its Subsidiaries, Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates; or (b) in any Restricted Area, own, manage,
engage in, operate, control, work for, consult with, render services for, do
business with, maintain any interest in (proprietary, financial or otherwise)
or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, any
business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or
otherwise, engaged in by the Company or its Subsidiaries on or at any time
within the 12-month period prior to the Closing Date and any business actually
proposed to be engaged in by the Companies as of the Closing (as evidenced by
specific strategic or other plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing Date) (a "Restricted Business"); provided, however, that the
restrictions contained in this Section 8.18 shall not restrict the acquisition
of less than 2% of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded
company engaged in a Restricted Business. As used herein, "Restricted Area"
shall mean the entire world. (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Specified
Business Contact" shall mean any Person that has or is expected to have, or at
any time during the 12-month period prior to the Closing had, a business
relationship with any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or prior to
the Closing Date (or as to whom a Seller obtains or obtained confidential
information concerning the business relationship or potential business
relationship between such Person and the Company, its Subsidiaries, Purchaser
or any of their respective Affiliates). 8.19 Tolling. The period of time
during which the restrictions set forth in Sections 8.17 and 8.18 hereof will
be in effect will be extended for a given Seller by the length of time during
which such Seller is in breach of the terms of those provisions as determined
by any court of competent jurisdiction. 8.20 Drag-Along. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the drag-along provisions set
forth in Section 3.6 of the Stockholders Agreement. ARTICLE IX CONDITIONS TO

a final determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares is made by a
court of competent jurisdiction in connection with any such exercise of
appraisal rights, then the only portion of such fair value to be included in
calculation of the Losses incurred as a result of such exercise is the amount,
if any, by which such fair value exceeds what otherwise would have been
payable by Purchaser with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
Section 3.1 hereof had they not been Dissenting Shares). (b) Subject to
Sections 10.5 and 10.6 hereof, each of the Sellers hereby agrees, severally

expected to give rise to Losses that may be indemnifiable under this Section
10.2 (it being understood and agreed that any reasonable out-of-pocket fees,
costs or expenses incurred in connection with such mitigation shall themselves
constitute Losses, to the extent the Losses mitigated would have been
indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 10.2). 10.3 Indemnification by
Purchaser and Surviving Corporation. (a) Subject to Sections 10.5 and 10.6
hereof, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation hereby jointly and severally

Parties the amount of, any and all Losses based upon, resulting from or in

connection with such mitigation shall themselves constitute Losses, to the
extent the Losses mitigated would have been indemnifiable pursuant to this
Section 10.3). 10.4 Indemnification Procedures. (a) A claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be
asserted by notice to (i) the Equity Holder Representative, in respect of a
claim for which indemnification is sought under Section 10.2(a), (ii) to the
applicable Seller, in respect of a claim  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme077.jpg) 

70 for which indemnification is sought under Section 10.2(b), and (iii) to
Purchaser, in respect of a claim for which indemnification is sought under
Section 10.3, in each case prior to expiration of the applicable survival
period for the provision or obligation forming the basis thereof. (b) In the
event of any Indemnification Claim, the indemnified party subject to such
claim shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of such
Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge to be forwarded to (i) the
Equity Holder Representative, in respect of an Indemnification Claim for which
payment may be sought under Section 10.2(a), (ii) to the applicable Seller, in
respect of an Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under
Section 10.2(b), and (iii) to Purchaser, in respect of an Indemnification
Claim for which payment may be sought under Section 10.3. The failure of the
indemnified party (or the Equity Holder Representative, in the case of an
Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under Section 10.3) to
give reasonably prompt notice of any such Indemnification Claim shall not
release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party's obligations with
respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced
as a result of such failure. The indemnifying party (or, in the case of an
Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under Section 10.2(a),
the Equity Holder Representative) shall have the right, at its sole option and
expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party (or the Equity Holder Representative, in
the case of an Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under
Section 10.3), and to defend against, negotiate or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it
hereunder. The indemnifying party (or, in the case of an Indemnification Claim
for which payment may be sought under Section 10.2(a), the Equity Holder
Representative) shall not be entitled to assume control of an Indemnification
Claim and the indemnifying party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the indemnified party if (A) the Indemnification Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment or allegation, or (B) the Indemnification Claim seeks injunctive or
other equitable relief, or which, if adversely determined, would impair in any
material respect the financial condition, business, operations, reputation or
prospects of the indemnified party. All expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the foregoing shall be
paid by the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party (or, in the case of
an Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under Section
10.2(a), the Equity Holder Representative) elects to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder, it shall within
thirty (30) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Indemnification Claim so
requires) notify the indemnified party (or the Equity Holder Representative,
in the case of an Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under
Section 10.3) of its intent to do so and acknowledge in writing without
qualification its indemnification obligation; provided that if the Equity
Holders are the indemnifying party or parties on behalf of which the Equity
Holder Representative defends against, negotiates, settles or otherwise deals
with such Indemnification Claim, the attorneys' fees and other Losses incurred
by the Equity Holder Representative in connection therewith shall be paid from
the Administrative Expense Account and shall accordingly reduce (by the amount
thereof) the Administrative Expense Account in accordance with Section 3.3(a).
If the indemnifying party (or, as applicable, the Equity Holder
Representative) elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified
against hereunder, the indemnified party (or the Equity Holder Representative,
in the case of an Indemnification Claim  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme078.jpg) 

71 for which payment may be sought under Section 10.3) may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim and its
costs of doing so shall constitute Losses for purposes of Section 10.2 or
10.3. If the indemnifying party (or, as applicable, the Equity Holder
Representative) shall assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim, the
indemnified party (or the Equity Holder Representative, in the case of an
Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under Section 10.3) may
participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Indemnification
Claim; provided, however, that such Person shall be entitled to participate in
any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying
party (but subject to Section 10.5 and 10.6) if, (i) so requested by the
indemnifying party (or, in the case of an Indemnification Claim for which
payment may be sought under Section 10.2(a), the Equity Holder Representative)
to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified
party (or the Equity Holder Representative, in the case of an Indemnification
Claim for which payment may be sought under Section 10.3), a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party that would make such separate representation advisable; and provided,
further, that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more
than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified
parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The parties hereto agree
to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation
or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 10.4 to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party (including,
in the case of an Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under
Section 10.2(a), the Equity Holder Representative) nor the indemnified party
(including the Equity Holder Representative, in the case of an Indemnification
Claim for which payment may be sought under Section 10.3) shall, without the
written consent of the Equity Holder Representative or Purchaser as applicable
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle
or compromise any Indemnification Claim or permit a default or consent to
entry of any judgment unless the claimant and such party provide to such other
party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of the
Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer
solely for money damages is made by the applicable third party claimant, and
the indemnifying party (or, in the case of an Indemnification Claim for which
payment may be sought under Section 10.2(a), the Equity Holder Representative)
notifies the indemnified party (including the Equity Holder Representative, in
the case of Indemnification Claim in for which payment may be sought under
Section 10.3) in writing of such Person's willingness to accept the settlement
offer and issue a full release of both the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party and, subject to the applicable limitations of Sections 10.5
and 10.6, pay the amount called for by such offer, and the indemnified party
(or, as applicable, the Equity Holder Representative) declines to accept such
offer, the indemnified party (or the Equity Holder Representative, in the case
of an Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under Section
10.3) may continue to contest such Indemnification Claim, free of any
participation by the indemnifying party (or, as applicable, the Equity Holder
Representative) at its own expense, and the amount of any ultimate liability
with respect to such Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying party has an
obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount
of the settlement offer that the indemnified party (or the Equity Holder
Representative, in the case of an Indemnification Claim for which payment may
be sought under Section 10.3) declined to accept plus any other Losses of the
indemnified party (or, as applicable, the Equity Holder Representative)
relating to such Indemnification Claim through the date of its rejection of
the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of the  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme079.jpg) 

72 indemnified party with respect to such Indemnification Claim (but in any
case, subject to Section 10.5 and 10.6). (c) After any final decision,
judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a
settlement shall have been consummated, or the indemnified party (or the
Equity Holder Representative, in the case of a claims for indemnification for
which payment may be sought under Section 10.3) and the indemnifying party
(or, in the case of a claim for indemnification for which payment may be
sought under Section 10.2(a), the Equity Holder Representative) shall have
arrived at an agreement with respect to a claim for indemnification hereunder,
the indemnified party (or, as applicable, the Equity Holder Representative)
shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by
the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter.
(d) Following the determination of any applicable amount that the Equity
Holders shall be obligated to indemnify pursuant to Section 10.2(a), the
Equity Holder Representative shall promptly direct, in accordance with Section
3.3, the Escrow Agent to distribute to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified
Party such amount in satisfaction of such obligations. 10.5 Certain
Limitations on Indemnification. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Article X, neither the Equity Holders nor Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation shall have any indemnification obligations for Losses under
Section 10.2(a)(i), Section 10.2(b)(i) or Section 10.3(a)(i), (i) for any
individual item, or group of items arising out of the same or series of
similar facts, conditions or events, where the aggregate amount of Losses
relating thereto is less than the Sub-Basket and where the aggregate amount of
Losses relating thereto is equal to or exceeds the Sub-Basket, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified parties, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to indemnification for the full amount of such individual item (or
group of items as set forth above), subject to clause (ii) below, and (ii)
unless the aggregate amount of all Losses on a cumulative basis suffered by
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may
be, exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent of such excess. In no
event shall the aggregate indemnification for which the Equity Holders are
obligated under Section 10.2(a)(i) and Section 10.2(b)(i) exceed the Cap. The
limitations on indemnification set forth in this Section 10.5(a) shall not
apply to Losses based upon or resulting from the failure of any of the
Fundamental Representations of the Company or of the Sellers or the Specified
Representations to be true and correct in all respects at and as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date. (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no Equity Holder shall be liable, other than with respect to fraud,
for any amount in excess of the proceeds of the Final Merger Consideration
entitled to be received by such Equity Holder pursuant to Section 3.1. Other
than with respect to fraud, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' first recourse
for indemnification by the Equity Holders under Section 10.2(a) and Section
10.2(b) shall be by application to the Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, and thereafter, the Purchaser shall have recourse, at
its sole discretion, to any and all of the Equity Holders in accordance with
each such Equity Holder's Ownership Percentage in an amount up to the Cap,
provided that to the extent that the Escrow Amount shall have first been
exhausted, the foregoing limitation shall not apply  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme080.jpg) 

73 to (i) Losses based upon or resulting from the failure of any of the
Fundamental Representations of the Company or of the Sellers or the Specified
Representations to be true and correct in all respects as of the date hereof
and as of the Closing Date or (ii) claims for indemnification under Sections
10.2(a)(ii) through (vi) or Section 10.2(b)(ii). (c) No Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall make any claim for indemnification under this Article X in respect
of any amount to extent that it is specifically reflected in and taken into
account as a Current Liability in the calculation of Net Working Capital,
including any adjustment to the Final Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.2. 10.6 Calculation of Losses. (a) The amount of any Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this Article X shall (i) be net of any Tax
benefits actually recognized as a cash reduction in Taxes by the indemnified
party and amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance
policies or otherwise with respect to such Losses (net of any Tax or expenses
incurred in connection with such recovery), (ii) be net of any amounts
recovered by the indemnified party from Collateral Sources, (iii) take into
account all increases in Taxes payable by the indemnified party as a result of
the receipt of the indemnity payment, and (iv) to the extent not previously
taken into account in computing the amount of the Loss, all increases in Taxes
payable by the indemnified party for all affected taxable years and periods as
a result of the event giving rise to such Loss. If amounts are recovered from
a Collateral Source after an indemnifying party makes a payment to or on
behalf of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article X, the net proceeds
thereof shall promptly be remitted to the Indemnifying Party that made such
payment. The parties acknowledge and agree that no right of subrogation to any
rights of any party hereunder shall accrue or inure to the benefit of any
Collateral Source. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in
this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person
for any punitive damages of such other Person, except to the extent payable to
a third party. 10.7 Materiality. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and
agree that, except for the representations set forth in Section 5.8(b), solely
for the purpose of determining the amount of the applicable Losses (and not,
for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining whether a breach has
occurred) qualifications as to materiality or material adverse effect (or any
similar qualification) in any representation, warranty or covenant set forth
herein or in any other document contemplated by this Agreement ("Materiality
Qualifiers") shall be ignored. 10.8 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the
Closing, other than with respect to any fraud claim, the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy for any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged
breach or failure to be true and correct, of any representation or warranty or
any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, shall be indemnification in
accordance with this Article X. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties
hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, other than
with respect to any fraud claim, any and all other rights, claims and causes
of action (including rights of contribution, if any) known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may
have against the Equity  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme081.jpg) 

74 Holders, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
arising under or based upon any Law to the extent arising out of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section
10.7 shall not operate to interfere with or impede the operation of the
provisions of Article III concerning the (i) resolution of certain disputes
relating to the Final Merger Consideration between the parties and/or by an
Independent Accountant and (ii) the rights of the parties to seek equitable
remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief). ARTICLE XI TAX
MATTERS 11.1 Tax Returns. (a) The Equity Holder Representative shall, at its
own expense, control the preparation of all Tax Returns for the Company and
the Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and the
appropriate officer(s) of the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the
Equity Holder Representative in such preparation and shall sign and timely
file same; provided such returns are prepared in accordance with applicable
Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Equity Holder Representative may prepare,
and the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries shall file, amended Tax
Returns and claims for refund in order to carry back any net operating loss or
net capital loss arising in the final Pre-Closing Tax Period. All Tax Returns
that Seller prepares or causes to be prepared in accordance with this
paragraph (a) shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past
practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, election made
or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or
methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods
(including positions, elections or methods that would have the effect of
deferring income to periods ending after the Closing Date or accelerating
deductions to periods ending on or before the Closing Date). Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to impose upon Equity Holder Representative the
obligation to prepare or file any Tax Return, and the parties hereto expressly
agree, as between the parties, that the Company remains obligated to discharge
its legal obligation to timely file all Tax Returns for any period. (b) Except
as provided in Section 11.1(a) above, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation
shall have the exclusive authority and obligation to prepare and timely file,
or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries; provided, however, that (i) Purchaser and
the Surviving Corporation shall provide the Equity Holder Representative with
draft income Tax Returns for the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries
required to be prepared by Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
this Section 11.1(b) for an Overlap Period at least twenty (20) Business Days
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns together with a statement
setting forth the amount of Tax for which the Equity Holders are responsible
pursuant to Section 11.2(b) (a "Tax Statement"), (ii) at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns, the
Equity Holder Representative shall notify Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation of the existence of any reasonable objection the Equity Holder
Representative may have to any material items set forth on such draft Tax
Returns or Tax Statement, and (iii) if, after consulting in good faith,
Purchaser and the Equity Holder Representative are unable to resolve such
objection(s),  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme082.jpg) 

75 such objection(s) shall be referred to an independent accounting firm
mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Equity Holder Representative for
resolution on a basis consistent with the past practices of the Company and
the Subsidiaries with respect to such items. If such independent accounting
firm is unable to make a determination with respect to any disputed item
within five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of the Tax
Return in question, then Purchaser may file such Tax Return on the due date
therefor without such determination having been made and without the Equity
Holder Representative's consent. Notwithstanding the filing of such Tax
Return, such independent accounting firm shall make a determination with
respect to any disputed item, and the amount of Taxes for which the Equity
Holders are responsible under Section 11.2 shall be as determined by such
independent accounting firm. The fees and expenses of such independent
accounting firm shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by the Equity
Holders. 11.2 Payment of Taxes. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
Article X of this Agreement, each Equity Holder shall be responsible and
liable for the timely payment of its Ownership Percentage of any and all Taxes
imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary, and any Taxes for which the Company
or any Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a member
of an affiliated group (including Taxes for which the Company or any
Subsidiary may be liable pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or similar
provisions of state, local or foreign law as a result of having been a member
of an affiliated group and any Taxes resulting from the Company or any
Subsidiary ceasing to be a member of any affiliated group) for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything herein to the contrary,
the Equity Holders shall not be liable for the payment of Taxes that are
Excluded Taxes. In addition, each Equity Holder shall pay the Company its
Ownership Percentage of any Taxes set forth on a Tax Statement (to the extent
that the Equity Holders are liable therefor and to the extent not already paid
by the Equity Holders on or before the Closing Date) on or prior to the day
that is three (3) Business Days prior to the due date of such Taxes; provided
that if the amount determined by the independent accounting firm pursuant to
Section 11.1(b) to be the responsibility of the Equity Holders is less than
the amount paid in the aggregate by the Equity Holders pursuant to this
sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the amount of such excess to the
Equity Holder Representative for the benefit of the Equity Holders. Any such
payment shall thereafter be distributed by the Equity Holder Representative to
the Equity Holders in accordance with their respective Ownership Percentages.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Equity Holder's reimbursement obligations
shall not be subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth in
Section 10.5. (b) All Taxes and Tax Liabilities (other than Excluded Taxes)
with respect to the income, property or operations of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries that relate to an Overlap Period shall be apportioned between
the Equity Holders, on the one hand, and Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation, on the other hand, as follows: (i) Taxes, other than those
referred to in clause (ii) below, shall be apportioned by means of a closing
of the books and records of the Company as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, provided, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be apportioned between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such period, and (ii) property  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme083.jpg) 

76 Taxes and ad valorem Taxes shall be apportioned between such two periods in
proportion to the number of days in each such period. Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation and the Equity Holders shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, elect with the relevant Taxing Authority to treat for all
purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period of the Company
and the Subsidiaries. No election under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-
76(b)(2)(ii) to ratably allocate income to an Overlap Period shall be made.
For the avoidance of doubt, all cancellation payments in respect of Options
and Warrants, all employee bonus payments and other compensation payments, and
all deductions attributable to Debt Payoff Amounts, repayments of
Indebtedness, unamortized debt issuance expenses and Transaction Expenses
together with any other properly deductible items arising in connection with
the Merger and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein paid
by the Company or the Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date
(collectively, "Merger Expenses") shall, to the extent allowable under
applicable Law, be treated as incurred and deductible in a Pre-Closing Tax
Period and shall be reported on the Company's federal income Tax Return for
the taxable period that includes the Closing Date to the extent allowable by
Law. Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall file consolidated and
combined income Tax Returns with the Surviving Corporation and shall treat the
taxable year of the Surviving Corporation as ending on the Closing Date to the
extent allowable under applicable Law. Such final income Tax Returns shall
include the election provided by Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 I.R.B.
746, with respect to all eligible success-based fees that would not be payable
absent the closing of the Merger. Three (3) Business Days prior to Closing,
the Company shall deliver to Purchaser its reasonable good faith estimate of
the Merger Expenses. 11.3 Controversies; Tax Benefits. (a) Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly notify the Equity Holder Representative
upon receipt by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser (including the
Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries) of written notice of any Tax
Matter. The Equity Holder Representative, at the Equity Holders' sole expense
(as to which each Equity Holder shall be liable for its Ownership Percentage),
shall have the authority (and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide the Equity Holder Representative's tax advisors with the
appropriate powers of attorney) to represent the interests of the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax Matter before the
IRS, any other Taxing Authority, any other Governmental Body or any court and
shall have the sole right to control the defense, compromise or other
resolution of any Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Tax
Returns and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for
additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of,
or relating to, a Tax Matter that Equity Holder Representative agrees with
Purchaser that, as between Purchaser and Equity Holders, Equity Holders shall
be liable for any Losses relating to Taxes that result from such Tax Matter.
The Equity Holder Representative shall keep Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status
and nature of any Tax Matter. The Equity Holder Representative shall, in good
faith, allow Purchaser to make comments to the Equity Holder Representative
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding. The Equity
Holder Representative shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any
Tax Matter with any Taxing Authority that would materially adversely affect
the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries without
the prior written  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme084.jpg) 

77 consent of the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. (b) Purchaser shall have the sole
right to control any audit or examination by any Taxing Authority, initiate
any claim for refund or amend any Tax Return, and contest, resolve and defend
against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other
adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, the income, assets or operations of
the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending
after the Closing Date, except for an Overlap Period or any Tax Return that
would materially adversely affect the Equity Holders as to which Purchaser and
the Surviving Corporation shall (i) keep the Equity Holder Representative
fully and timely informed with respect to such proceedings (by provision of
information to the Equity Holder Representative), (ii) in good faith, allow
the Equity Holder Representative to make comments to the Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such
proceeding, (iii) allow the Equity Holder Representative to participate at its
own expense in any such proceeding, and (iv) not enter into any settlement or
compromise without the prior written consent of the Equity Holder
Representative, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed.
(c) If, following the Closing, it is established in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 11.3(c) and Section 11.3(d) that
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries realized a Tax
Benefit, Purchaser shall pay, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to pay, to the Equity Holder Representative, for the benefit of the Equity
Holders, an amount that is equal to the amount of such Tax Benefit. Any such
payment with respect to a Tax Benefit shall be paid to the Equity Holder
Representative within thirty (30) days following the day when Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries realizes the Tax Benefit, and
thereafter the payment shall be distributed by the Equity Holder
Representative to the Equity Holders in accordance with their respective
Ownership Percentages. A Tax Benefit will be considered to be realized (A) on
the date on which a cash Tax Refund attributable to Merger Expenses is
received by the Company, or (B) to the extent that the Merger Expenses do not
generate a cash Tax Refund but rather reduce liability for Taxes, on the due
date (including any extensions actually filed) of the Tax Return that reflects
such change in liability for Taxes; provided, however, that the Company shall
elect, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, to receive a cash Tax
Refund with respect to such Tax Benefit rather than applying an available
refund as a credit against future Tax liabilities. A Tax Benefit shall be
deemed to be realized in a taxable year if, and to the extent that, the
Purchaser's, the Surviving Corporation's or such Subsidiary's cumulative
liability for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by excluding the
relevant Tax Benefit, exceeds the Purchaser's, the Surviving Corporation's or
such Subsidiary's actual liability for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated
by taking into account the relevant Tax Benefit, and by assuming that the
Surviving Corporation recognizes all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit prior to recognizing any deduction or loss with respect to
such Tax Benefit. Any deductions taken into account in determining the Tax
Benefits under this Section 11.3(c) shall not be taken into account in
provisions of this Agreement relating to Section 11.3(e) or Section 10.6(a).
Equity Holders shall refund to the Purchaser, Surviving Corporation, or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, any Tax Benefit that has been paid by the
Purchasers, the Surviving Corporation, or such Subsidiaries to the Equity
Holder Representative if there is a subsequent determination by a taxing
authority that such Tax Benefit was improperly realized. Within thirty (30)
days following the filing of the Surviving Corporation's U.S. Pre-  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme085.jpg) 

78 Closing Tax Returns, Purchaser shall file or caused to be filed U.S.
federal and state income tax refund claims (including for previously paid
estimated Taxes) carrying back any losses generated by the Merger Expenses to
each open Taxable year for which a claim may properly be made under applicable
Law, to the extent such amounts are not recovered pursuant to Section 6425 of
the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser's obligations under
this Section 11.3(c) shall only apply with respect to any taxable periods
occurring within three (3) years from the date of this Agreement. (d) If a Tax
Benefit payment is due pursuant to Section 11.3(c) for any taxable year, on or
prior to five days following the date on which the Surviving Corporation files
its U.S. federal income Tax Return for such taxable year, Purchaser will
deliver to the Equity Holder Representative an explanation and calculation of
the Tax Benefit for that taxable year, along with copies of the relevant
portions of Tax Returns which demonstrate the effective Tax rate and
realization of a Tax Benefit and such other information as the Equity Holder
Representative may reasonably request. In the event of any disagreement
between the Equity Holder Representative and the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the calculation of the Tax Benefit, such disagreement shall be
resolved by a nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Accountants")
mutually agreed upon by the Equity Holder Representative and the Surviving
Corporation and any such determination by the Accountants shall be final and
binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of the Accountants shall be
borne equally by the Surviving Corporation and the Equity Holders (with the
amount to be borne by the Equity Holders to be borne in accordance with their
respective Ownership Percentages). (e) Except to the extent that such Tax
Refunds result from a deduction included in the calculation of a Tax Benefit
as provided for in Section 11.3(c), any Tax Refunds that are received by the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that are attributable to any
Pre- Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of the Equity Holders and
shall be forwarded by Purchaser to the Equity Holder Representative on behalf
of such Equity Holders, except to the extent that (A) such Tax Refund arises
as a result of a carryback of a loss or other Tax Benefit attributable to a
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, or (B) the facts
and circumstances that gave rise to such Tax Refund result in an increased Tax
liability for a period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall, if the Equity Holder Representative so requests and at the
Equity Holders' expense, cause the relevant entity (Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary or any successor) to file for and obtain any Tax
Refunds to which the Equity Holder Representative is entitled hereunder.
Purchaser shall forward to the Equity Holder Representative on behalf of the
Equity Holders any such Tax Refund promptly after the Tax Refund is received
(net of any costs incurred in obtaining such Tax Refund, including any Taxes
due thereon), and the Equity Holder Representative shall distribute such Tax
Refund to the Equity Holders in accordance with their respective Ownership
Percentages. (f) In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
Section 11.3 and Section 10.4, the provisions of this Section 11.3 shall
govern. 11.4 Amended Tax Returns; Carrybacks. Neither the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries shall file or cause to be
filed any amended Tax Return or  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme086.jpg) 

79 claim for refund for any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written
consent of the Equity Holder Representative, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 11.5 Prior Tax Agreements. Each
Equity Holder shall terminate or cause to be terminated any and all of the Tax
Sharing Arrangements, allocation, indemnification or similar agreements,
arrangements or undertakings in effect, written or unwritten, on the Closing
Date as between such Equity Holders or any predecessor or Affiliate thereof,
on the one hand, and the Surviving Corporation and any of the Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, for all Taxes imposed by any Taxing Authority, regardless of
the period in which such Taxes are imposed, and there shall be no continuing
obligation to make any payments under any such agreements, arrangements or
undertakings. 11.6 Post-Closing Access and Cooperation. After the Closing
Date, each of Equity Holder Representative and Purchaser shall (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to): (a) timely sign and deliver such
certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate to establish an
exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports
with respect to, Taxes described in Section 12.1 (relating to sales, transfer
and similar Taxes); (b) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns
which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance
with paragraph Section 11.1 and in connection therewith, provide the other
party with any necessary powers of attorney; (c) cooperate fully in preparing
for and defending any audits of, or disputes with taxing authorities
regarding, any Tax Returns of the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary;
(d) make available to the other and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary; and (e) furnish the other with
copies of all correspondence received from any Taxing Authority in connection
with any Tax audit or information request with respect to any such taxable
period. Purchaser agrees that it shall, from and after the Closing Date, cause
the Surviving Corporation to preserve (in no worse a condition and fashion as
they were at the time of Closing) all books and records of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries for the period contemplated by and otherwise
subject to the terms of Section 8.9 hereof. ARTICLE XII MISCELLANEOUS 12.1
Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes. All sales, use, transfer, intangible,
recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges, of any nature
whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the transactions contemplated by

by Purchaser.  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme087.jpg) 

80 12.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
parties shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement, document
and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. 12.3 Equity Holder
Representative. (a) By virtue of the adoption and approval of this Agreement,
each Equity Holder hereby irrevocably appoints the Equity Holder
Representative as such Equity Holder's representative, attorney-in-fact and
agent, with full power of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of
such Equity Holder in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and to act on behalf of such Equity Holder in any amendment of or
litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement, including defending,
negotiating, settling or otherwise dealing with claims under Article X hereof,
and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and to
execute all such documents, as such Equity Holder Representative shall deem
necessary or appropriate in conjunction with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (subject to the foregoing limitation),
including the power: (i) to take all action necessary or desirable in
connection with the waiver of any condition to the obligations of the Company
or the Equity Holder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) to negotiate, execute and deliver all ancillary agreements,
statements, certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments and other documents required or permitted to be given
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (it being understood that such Equity Holder shall execute and
deliver any such documents which the Equity Holder Representative agrees to
execute); (iii) to give and receive all notices and communications to be given
or received under this Agreement and to receive service of process in
connection with any claims under this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iv) to deal with the Administrative Expense Account and
the Escrow Account in accordance with Section 3.3, Section 3.4 and Article X;
(v) to receive and disburse any amounts to be paid to Equity Holders under
this Agreement; and (vi) to take all actions which under this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby may be taken by the Equity Holders and to
do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the Equity
Holders which the Equity Holder Representative deems necessary or appropriate
in his sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby as fully and completely as such Equity
Holder could do if personally present. (b) The Equity Holder Representative
will not be liable to the Equity Holders for any act taken or omitted by it as
permitted under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme088.jpg) 

81 hereby, except if such act is taken or omitted in bad faith or involves
fraud or willful misconduct. The Equity Holder Representative will also be
fully protected against the Equity Holders in relying upon any written notice,
demand, certificate or document that it in good faith believes to be genuine
(including facsimiles thereof). (c) The Equity Holders agree, in accordance
with their respective Ownership Percentages, to indemnify the Equity Holder
Representative for, and to hold the Equity Holder Representative harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without bad faith, fraud or
willful misconduct on the part of the Equity Holder Representative, arising
out of or in connection with the Equity Holder Representative's carrying out
its duties under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including costs and expenses of successfully defending Equity Holder
Representative against any claim of liability with respect thereto. The Equity
Holder Representative may consult with counsel of its own choice and will have
full and complete authorization and protection for any action taken and
suffered by it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such
counsel. (d) In furtherance, and not in limitation, of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 12.3, each Equity Holder executing and delivering a
Letter of Transmittal shall provide the Equity Holder Representative with the
power (including as representative, attorney-in-fact and agent, with full
power of substitution to act in the name, place and stead thereof) to
similarly take such actions or refrain from taking such actions on behalf of
such Equity Holder as provided to the Equity Holder Representative by the
Equity Holders pursuant hereto. (e) If ACAS becomes unable or unwilling to
serve as Equity Holder Representative, such other Person or Persons as may be
designated by a majority of the Equity Holders, based on each Equity Holder's
Ownership Percentage, shall succeed as the Equity Holder Representative. (f)
The grant of authority to the Equity Holder Representative provided for in
this Section 12.3, (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable
and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy and liquidation of any of the
Equity Holders, and (ii) shall survive the Closing. (g) Purchaser shall be
entitled conclusively and absolutely to rely, without inquiry, upon any action
of the Equity Holder Representative as the action of each Equity Holder in all
matters referred to in this Section 12.3. 12.4 Submission to Jurisdiction;
Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) The parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or
state court located within the County of New Castle, State of Delaware, over
any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action proceeding related
thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme089.jpg) 

82 hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by the delivery of a
copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.7. (c) THE
PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OR IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT,
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTIES WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. 12.5 Entire Agreement; Amendments
and Waivers. (a) This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits hereto)
and the Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding and
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof. (b) This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or changed, and
any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific
reference to this Agreement signed by Equity Holder Representative or
Purchaser, as applicable. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
12.6 Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts negotiated, made and performed in such State without
giving effect to the choice of law

receipt), (ii) when sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of

Brian Fahrney and Michael Heinz 12.8 Severability. If any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being
enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms or provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible. Each of the restrictions and covenants contained herein
(including those set forth in Section 8.17 and 8.18) is independent and
severable. It is the intention of the parties hereto that if any of the
restrictions or covenants contained herein (including those set forth in
Section 8.17 and 8.18) is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a
length of time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way
construed to be unreasonable or to any extent invalid, such provision shall
not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such
provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform such sections to
provide for a covenant having a reasonable and enforceable geographic area,
time period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as
shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable Law. 12.9 Conflicts and
Privilege. Purchaser and the Company (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries) agree that, notwithstanding any current or prior representation
of the Company and the Subsidiaries by AandP, Weil and OMM, AandP, Weil and OMM
shall be allowed to represent any Seller, the Equity Holder Representative or
any of their Affiliates in any matters and disputes (or any other matter),
including in any matter or dispute adverse to Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary that relates to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (a "Dispute") and Purchaser and the Company (on behalf of itself and
the Subsidiaries) hereby (i) waive any claim they have or may have that AandP,
Weil or OMM has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from
engaging in such representation and (ii) agrees that, in the event that a
Dispute arises after the Closing between Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary and any Seller, the Equity Holder Representative or any of their
Affiliates, AandP, Weil and OMM may represent such Seller, the Equity Holder
Representative or Affiliate in such Dispute even though the interests of such
Seller, the Equity Holder Representative or Affiliate may be directly adverse
to Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiaries and even though AandP, Weil or OMM
may have represented the Company or the Subsidiaries in a matter substantially
related to such Dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Purchaser, the
Company or the Subsidiaries; provided, however, that that no such
representation shall be a waiver of any  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme093.jpg) 

86 attorney-client privilege between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and AandP, Weil or OMM, on the other hand, and each of the
Equity Holder Representative and the Sellers shall cause AandP, Weil and OMM
acting as its respective counsel to not take any actions or engage in any
representation that would effect or be deemed to be such a waiver. Following
the Closing, Purchaser agrees that it will not (i) request from the AandP, Weil
or OMM, the Equity Holder Representative or the Sellers or (ii) use or
intentionally access any of the communications among AandP, Weil or OMM, the
Company or any Subsidiary, and/or any Seller relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Communications") in connection with any Dispute or
potential Dispute; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
prevent Purchaser from requesting, using or accessing any Communications in
connection with document production requests or discovery in any Legal
Proceeding so long as such Communications would not be subject to an attorney-
client privilege if they were being requested in a Legal Proceeding by an
unrelated third party and such Communications are produced or required to be
produced in response to such document production requests or discovery.
Following the Closing, the Equity Holder Representative and the Sellers shall
be permitted to use the Communications in connection with the defense of any
Dispute with Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that
such use does not waive any applicable privileges or protections that can or
may be asserted to prevent disclosure of any Communications to any third
party. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 12.9 or in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable privileges or
protections that can or may be asserted to prevent disclosure of any
Communications to any third party, and neither the Equity Holder
Representative nor any Seller shall take any action, or cause AandP, Weil or OMM
to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to waive any such
privilege or protection as to any third party. 12.10 Binding Effect;
Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No
assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be
made by either the Company, the Sellers or Purchaser, directly or indirectly
(by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the required
consents shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and Merger
Sub may, at their respective election and, solely in the case of Purchaser,
without relieving any of its obligations or liabilities hereunder, assign
their respective rights hereunder, in whole or in part, to an Affiliate of
Purchaser without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and,
following the Closing, Purchaser and Merger Sub may freely assign any or all
of their respective rights under this Agreement (including its indemnification
rights under Article X), in whole or in part, to any other Person without
obtaining the consent or approval of any other party hereto or any other
Person. No assignment of any obligations hereunder, other than by Merger Sub,
shall relieve the parties hereto of any such obligations. Upon any such
permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser or Merger
Sub shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise
requires. 12.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile), each of which will be deemed to be an
original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be
deemed to constitute one and the same agreement, and shall become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties.  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme094.jpg) 

87 12.12 Termination of Agreements. Effective upon the Closing, each of the
Company and the Sellers agree that the Stockholders Agreement shall be
terminated in its entirety and no party thereto shall have any further rights,
duties, liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever with respect to,
in connection with or otherwise arising under the Stockholders Agreement. With
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Company and the Sellers hereby waives compliance with the Stockholders
Agreement, to the extent that any Section would require any action on the part
of the Company or the Sellers on or prior to the Closing Date. 12.13 Specific
Performance. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the breach of this
Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the other party hereto and that
neither party will have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the respective
obligations of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Sellers and the Purchaser
under this Agreement shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance
issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive
relief may be applied for (without bond) and granted in connection therewith.
Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in
addition to any other remedies which any party may have under this Agreement
or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the
Sellers and the Equity Holder Representative hereby agree that, in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by any Seller of any covenant or obligation
set forth in Section 8.18 or Section 8.19, (a) Purchaser and its Affiliates
will suffer irreparable harm which cannot adequately be compensated by
monetary damages; and (b) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be entitled,
without proof of actual damages, in addition to and without limiting any other
remedy that may be available to it, to obtain: (i) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation; and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. 12.14 No Third Party Beneficiaries. No Person other than
the parties hereto and the Equity Holders shall have any rights, remedies, or
benefits under any provision of this Agreement, other than Section 8.7 and
Article X (to the extent provided therein). 12.15 Conflicts Between
Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that to the
extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are in any way inconsistent
with or in conflict with any term, condition or provision of any other
agreement, certificate, document or instrument contemplated hereby, this
Agreement shall govern and control. 12.16 Consents. Purchaser agrees and
acknowledges that, following the Closing, the Equity Holders and the Equity
Holder Representative shall have no liability whatsoever to Purchaser (and
Purchaser shall not be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any material consents that may have been or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and are expressly set forth on Schedule 5.3(a) or Schedule 5.3(b).
12.17 Time of the Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth
or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.  

   

 ![](ex21delstarmergeragreeme095.jpg) 

88 12.18 Non-Recourse. Following the Closing, no claims or causes of action
may be brought or maintained against any past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any party hereto (including
any person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a party
hereto) which is not otherwise expressly identified as a party hereto, and no
recourse shall be brought or granted against any of the foregoing in such
capacities, in each case, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of any party hereto set forth or contained in this
Agreement or any exhibit or Schedule hereto or any certificate delivered
hereunder. ** REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK **
