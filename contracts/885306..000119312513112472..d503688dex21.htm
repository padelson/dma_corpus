by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this
Article. Indemnitee&#146;s expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing Indemnitee&#146;s right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified
by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder it shall be a defense that the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">8. <U>Limitations</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds
of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to
the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">9. <U>Subsequent Amendment</U>. No amendment, termination or
