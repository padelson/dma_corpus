Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery).  Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together

be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration

be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) and the Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of

Agent pursuant to this _Section 1.3_  (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") which remains

shares of Company Stock prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied
with this _Article I_ shall thereafter look only to Buyer and only as general
creditors thereof for payment of their claim for cash representing unclaimed
Merger Consideration associated with such holders Certificates.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) None of Buyer, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to
any Person in respect of cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to twelve
months after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any cash in respect of which such Certificate would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, become the property of Buyer, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange
Fund, as directed by Buyer on a daily basis. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Buyer.

  

#### 

  

## _Section 1.4_ _ __Transfer Taxes; Withholding Taxes_. All sales, use,
property and other transfer Taxes payable as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Buyer. Buyer or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Buyer or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all

## purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

## 

  

## _Section 1.5_ _ __No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company
Stock_. The Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of
any Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Certificate.

  

## 

  

## _Section 1.6_ _ __Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred
Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock shall thereafter be made. Subject
to the last sentence of _Section 1.3(d)_ hereof, if after the Effective Time
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this  _Article I_.

  

## 

  

## _Section 1.7_ _ __Stock Options_.

  

## 

  

#### (a) At the Effective Time, all outstanding options which have vested (or
vest as a result of the Merger) granted pursuant to the Company Stock Option
Plans shall be cancelled and each holder of a cancelled option shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration for the cancellation of such option, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously subject to such option and (y) the excess, if any, of
Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock previously subject to such option (such product is
herein referred to as the "Option Cancellation Expense"). At the Effective

provision shall be made for discharging all obligations under all outstanding
unexercised Warrants by providing that each holder of a Warrant shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration for the exercise of such Warrant, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously subject to such Warrant and (y) the excess, if any,
of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of
Common Stock previously subject to such Warrant (such product is herein
referred to as the "Warrant Cancellation Expense").

## _Section 1.8_ _ __Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 1.2(b)_
hereof, shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
and perfected appraisal rights under Title 3, Subtitle 2, of the MGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Title 3,
Subtitle 2, of the MGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall effectively withdraw or lose his, her
or its right to appraisal and payment under the MGCL, such holders shares of

## Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive Merger Consideration as set forth in _Section
1.2(a)_ hereof, and such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Buyer prompt notice of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the MGCL by a holder of Dissenting
Shares and received by the Company. The Company and Buyer shall jointly

Subsidiaries own or have the defensible right to use, whether
through ownership, licensing or otherwise, all Intellectual Property
currently used in the operation of the businesses of each of the Company

"). Except as set forth in Section 3.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule:
(A) to the Companys Knowledge, no written claim of invalidity or conflicting
ownership rights with respect to any Material Intellectual Property has been
made by a third party and no such Material Intellectual Property is the
subject of any pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened action,
suit, claim, investigation, arbitration or other proceeding; (B) no Person
has given written notice to the Company or any Company Subsidiary that the
use of any Material Intellectual Property by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any licensee is infringing or has infringed any domestic or
foreign patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, or copyright or design
right, or that the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any licensee has
misappropriated or improperly used or disclosed any trade
secret, confidential information or know-how; (C) the making, using,
selling, manufacturing, marketing, licensing, reproduction, distribution or

intellectual property right of any third party, and does not and will not
involve the misappropriation or improper use or disclosure of any trade
secrets, confidential information or know-how of any third party; (D) to the
Companys Knowledge, there exists no prior act or current conduct or use by
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any third party that would void or
invalidate any Material Intellectual Property; and (E) the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by
the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby will not breach, violate or conflict with any instrument or agreement
concerning any Material Intellectual Property, will not cause the forfeiture
or termination or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any of
the Material Intellectual Property or impair in any material respect the
right of the Surviving Entity to make, use, sell, license or dispose of, or
to bring any action for the infringement of any Material Intellectual
Property. In addition, the matters disclosed on Section 3.16 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

## _Section 3.17_ _ __Taxes_. Except as set forth in Section 3.17 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule,

  

## 

  

#### (a) The Company Operating Partnership and their Subsidiaries have
properly completed and filed on a timely basis and in correct form all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company, the Company Operating
Partnership and their Subsidiaries (each such entity, a " _Taxpayer_ ") on or
prior to the date hereof. All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all material respects. An extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return that has not been filed has not been requested or granted. All Taxes of
any Taxpayer due and payable have been timely paid or are being contested in
good faith. The unpaid Taxes of all of the Taxpayers as of December 31, 2002
do not exceed the reserve for tax liability (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and tax
income) set forth

  



  

21      
   



  

#### or included in the Company Balance Sheet.  All unpaid Taxes of all of
the Taxpayers that have accrued since December 31, 2002 have been adequately
provided for on the books and records of the Taxpayers.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) No material issues have been raised (and are currently pending) in
writing by any taxing authority in connection with any Tax Return of any
Taxpayer. No waivers of statutes of limitation with respect to any material
Tax Returns of any Taxpayer have been given by or requested from the
applicable Taxpayer. All deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a
result of any examinations have been fully paid or are being contested and an
adequate reserve therefor has been established and is fully reflected on the
books and records of all of the Taxpayers.  No Taxpayer has received written
notice from any governmental agency in the past five (5) years in a
jurisdiction in which such entity does not file a Tax Return stating that
such entity is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) There are no liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet
due and payable) on any of the assets of any Taxpayer.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) No Taxpayer is a party to or bound by (nor will any such Taxpayer
become a party to or bound by) any tax-indemnity, tax-sharing or tax-
allocation agreement. No Taxpayer is bound under any agreement with any
holder of Company OP Units that provide any tax protections, including any
agreements that would restrict any Taxpayers ability to sell properties
or to repay or refinance any debt. As of the date hereof, no limited partner
of the Company Operating Partnership has raised, or to the Knowledge of
the Company threatened to raise, a material claim against the Company or
the Company Operating Partnership for any breach of any tax protection
agreement or any similar arrangement.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) None of the assets of any Taxpayer is property required to be
treated as being owned by any other Person pursuant to the "safe harbor
lease" provisions of former Section 168(f)(8) of the Code. None of the assets
of any Taxpayer directly or indirectly secures any debt the interest on which
is tax-exempt under Section 103(a) of the Code.  None of the assets of any
Taxpayer is "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of
the Code.

  

#### 

  

#### (f) Neither the Company nor any predecessors of the Company by merger or
consolidation has within the past three years been a party to a transaction
intended to qualify under Section 355 of the Code or under so much of Section
356 of the Code as relates to Section 355 of the Code.

  

#### 

  

#### (g) Commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1994 through its
taxable year ended December 31, 2002, the Company has been subject to
taxation as a REIT within the meaning of the Code and has satisfied the
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years. From January 1, 2003 until
the date hereof the Company has been subject to taxation as a REIT within the
meaning of the Code and has satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT
for such period. The Company has not taken or omitted to take any action
that could reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the Internal
Revenue Service to its status as REIT, and no such challenge is pending or,
to the Companys Knowledge, threatened. Each Company Subsidiary, including
the Company Operating Partnership, which files tax returns as a

  



  

22      
   



  

#### partnership for federal income tax purposes has since its acquisition by
the Company been classified for federal income Tax purposes as a partnership
(or a disregarded entity) and not as a corporation or an association or
"publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(a) of the
Code that is treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes under
Section 7704(a) of the Code. Each other Company Subsidiary has been and
continues to be treated as a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning
of Section 856(i) of the Code or as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the
meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code for federal and state income
Tax purposes. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds any asset
the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of
the Code as a result of an election under Notice 88-19 or the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Code Section 337.

  

#### 

  

#### (h) Since its formation, the Company has not incurred and does not
expect to incur through the Closing Date any liability for Taxes under
Section 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code.

of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary,

Employee Benefit Plans and provide benefits to the employees of the Company
that are substantially similar in all material respects, on a plan-by-plan
basis, to the Company Employee Benefit Plans in which such employees
participated prior to the Closing Date. With respect to any such plan which is
an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and any other
service based benefits (including vacations) in which the employees of the
Company may participate, solely for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits but not for purposes of
accrual of benefits (except in the case of accrued vacation, sick or personal
time), service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as
service with the Surviving Entity. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Surviving Entity shall not treat any Company employee as a "new" employee
for purposes of any pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements or similar provision under any health
or other welfare plan, and will make appropriate arrangements with its
insurance carrier(s), to the extent applicable, to ensure such result.

  

#### 

  

## _Section 5.13_ _ __Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  

## 

  

#### (a) The organizational documents of the Surviving Entity shall contain
the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the Company
Charter and Company By-laws on the date of this Agreement, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time
were directors or officers of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in
respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), unless such modification is required by Law.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) The Company and, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
officers and directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, expenses,
claims, damages, liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement of, with
the approval of the Surviving Entity (which approval shall not unreasonably
be withheld), or otherwise incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ "), based in whole or in part
by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Company and arising out of actions, events or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), in each case to the fullest
extent permitted under the Laws of the State of Maryland (" _Maryland Law_ ")
(and shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such
action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted under Maryland Law, upon receipt from the Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced of the undertaking to repay such advances contemplated
by Section 2-418(f) of Maryland Law).

  



  

41      
   



  

#### (c) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any Claim is brought
against any Indemnified Party after the Effective Time (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain
the Companys regularly engaged independent legal counsel or other
independent legal counsel satisfactory to them, provided that such other
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Entity, (ii) the
Surviving Entity shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received and
(iii) the Surviving Entity will use its reasonable commercial efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter, _provided_ , that the
Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any settlement of any Claim effected
without its written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this _Section 5.13_ upon learning of any such Claim
shall notify the Surviving Entity (although the failure so to notify the
Surviving Entity shall not relieve the Surviving Entity from any
liability which the Surviving Entity may have under this _Section 5.13_ ,
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Surviving
Entitys position with respect to such claim). The Indemnified Parties as a
group may retain no more than one law firm (in addition to local counsel) to
represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct (as determined by counsel to the
Indemnified Parties), an actual conflict between the interests of any two or
more Indemnified Parties, in which event such additional counsel as may be
required may be retained by the Indemnified Parties.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained in effect liability insurance
policies for directors and officers on terms not less favorable than those in
effect on the date hereof in terms of coverage and amounts (" _D andO
Insurance_"), to the extent that such DandO Insurance can be maintained
annually at a cost to the Surviving Entity not greater than one hundred and
fifty percent (150%) of the annual premium for the Company directors and
officers liability insurance as of the Closing Date; provided that if such
insurance cannot be so maintained or obtained at such annualized costs, the
Surviving Entity shall maintain or obtain as much of such insurance on an
annual basis as can be so maintained or obtained at a cost equal to
one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the annual premium for the
Company directors and officers liability insurance as of the Closing Date.
At the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall purchase DandO Insurance, on
the terms and subject to the limitations decribed in the foregoing sentence,
for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary thereof.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) Each Indemnified Party shall have rights as a third party
beneficiary under this _Section 5.13_ as separate contractual rights for his
or her benefit and such right shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Party,
its heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving
Entity and its successors and assigns. If requested by an Indemnified Party,
the Surviving Entity shall enter into an indemnity agreement with such
Indemnified Party evidencing the Surviving Entitys obligations under this
_Section 5.13_.

  

#### 

  

#### (f) In the event any claim is made against any Indemnified Party that is
covered or potentially covered by DandO Insurance, the Surviving Entity shall
not take any action or fail to take any action that would forfeit,
jeopardize, restrict or limit the insurance coverage available for such claim
until the final disposition thereof. The provisions of this _Section 5.13(f)_
 (i) shall survive the closing of the Merger, are intended to benefit
the Company, the Surviving Entity and each Indemnified Party (each of whom
and their heirs and legal representatives shall

  



  

42      
   



  

be entitled to enforce this _Section 5.13(f)_ against the Surviving Entity),
and the Surviving Entity shall pay all reasonable legal fees and
disbursements (if any) incurred by or on behalf of any such person in
successfully enforcing its rights under this _Section 5.13_ and (ii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

## 

  

#### (a) All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Company, the Company Operating Partnership or any of their
subsidiaries set forth in Section 5.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date,
no such entity shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder for
amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) From and after the date hereof through the Effective Time, the
Company shall use efforts in accordance with Section 5.8(a) to maintain its
qualification as a REIT.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) The applicable parties shall file all forms required by Section 1060
of the Code (and any applicable State or local equivalent).

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Buyer and the Company agree to allocate the consideration paid for
the purchased assets (i.e., the purchase price plus any debt assumed by
Buyer) as detailed in Section 5.14 of the Buyers Disclosure Schedule for all
purposes.

  

#### 

  

## _Section 5.15_ _ __Resignations_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall
cause the directors and officers of each of the Company Subsidiaries to
submit their resignations from such positions, effective as of the Effective
Time, as requested by Buyer.

Operating Partnership Agreement by the requisite vote of holders of Company
OP Units, concurrently with the Effective Time, the Company, as the general
partner of the Company Operating Partnership, shall use efforts in accordance
with Section 5.8(a) to cause the Company Operating Partnership Agreement to
be amended and restated substantially in the form set forth on _Exhibit C_
hereto (the " _Amendment and Restatement of the Company Operating Partnership
Agreement_ "). Buyer agrees that at the Effective Time, it shall execute the
Amendment and Restatement of the Company Operating Partnership Agreement as
the General Partner succeeding to the rights, interests and obligations of
the Company.

  

## 

  

## _Section 5.17_ _ __Estoppel Certificates_. To assist Buyer in connection
with (a) its efforts to secure financing for the transactions contemplated
hereby and (b) the operations of the Surviving Entity after the Closing Date,
the Company agrees to use efforts in accordance with Section 5.8(a) to
procure estoppel certificates from certain major tenants as reasonably
requested by Buyer in writing (which writing shall identify the specific
tenants). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
Buyers obligation to effect the Merger and the transactions contemplated
herein are not subject to the procurement of any estoppel certificates
contemplated by this _Section 5.17_.

  



  

43      
   



  

## _Section 5.18_ _ __Company Charter Amendment_. The Company shall use
efforts in accordance with Section 5.8(a) to cause an amendment to the
Company Charter substantially in the form set forth on _Exhibit D_  hereto
(the " _Company Charter Amendment_ ") to be approved by the holders of a
majority of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock at the
