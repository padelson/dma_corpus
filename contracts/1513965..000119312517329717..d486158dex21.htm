NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_Section_ __ _ 5.8_.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of SXE GP, AMID GP or their respective members, (i) the SXE
Partnership Agreement shall remain unchanged and shall continue in effect
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
and (ii) all limited partners of SXE immediately prior to the Effective Time

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT ON UNITS

 

Section 2.1 _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of SXE GP, SXE, AMID GP, AMID or the
holder of any securities of SXE:

(a) _Conversion of Common Units_. Subject to  _Section 2.1(c)_ , _Section
2.2(h)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, (i) each Common Unit issued and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Common Units held by
Southcross Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries) shall be converted into the
right to receive 0.160 (the "Exchange Ratio") AMID Units (the "Merger
Consideration"), and (ii) each Common Unit, Subordinated Unit and Class B
Convertible Unit issued and outstanding held by Southcross Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries, as of the Effective Time, shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration
will be delivered in exchange for such cancelled SXE Securities.

(b) _Cancellation of SXE Incentive Distribution Rights_. The SXE Incentive
Distribution Rights outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange for such cancelled
SXE Incentive Distribution Rights. 

(c) _Cancellation of SXE-Owned Units_. Any SXE Securities that are owned upon
consummation of the Holdings Contribution and immediately prior to the
Effective Time by AMID, SXE or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange for such canceled SXE Securities.

(d) _Conversion of the Membership Interests in Merger Sub_. The membership
interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into Common Units of SXE (as the Surviving
Entity), representing 100% of the aggregate partnership interest (as defined
in the DRULPA) of all limited partners in the Surviving Entity, and AMID
shall be admitted as the only limited partner of the Surviving Entity. At the
Effective Time, the books and records of SXE (as the Surviving Entity) shall
be revised to reflect the admission of AMID as the only limited partner of
the Surviving Entity and the simultaneous withdrawal of all other SXE Limited
Partners.

 



3 (e) _Certificates_. All Common Units converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) (a
"Certificate") or evidence of units in book-entry form ("Book-Entry Units")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Common Units
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, any distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(g)_ to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Unit
in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ , without interest, and the right to be
admitted as an AMID Limited Partner. AMID GP hereby consents to the admission
(as an AMID Limited Partner) of each SXE Unitholder who is issued AMID Units
in accordance with this _Article II_ , upon the proper surrender of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Unit representing Common Units. Upon such surrender
of the Certificate or Book-Entry Unit and the recording of the name of such
Person as a limited partner of AMID on the books and records of AMID, such
Person shall automatically and effective as of the Effective Time be admitted
as an AMID Limited Partner and be bound by the AMID Partnership Agreement as
such. By its surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Unit, or by its
acceptance of AMID Units, as applicable, a SXE Unitholder confirms its
agreement to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the AMID
Partnership Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, AMID shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to SXE (the "Exchange Agent") for the
purpose of exchanging Certificates or Book-Entry Units for the Merger
Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but
in no event more than five business days following the Effective Time,
AMID will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
record of Common Units as of the Effective Time (and, to the extent
commercially practicable, to make available for collection by hand, during
customary business hours commencing immediately after the Effective Time, if
so elected by such holder of record), whose Common Units were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) in such forms as SXE and AMID may reasonably agree, including, as
applicable, instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Units to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the
Merger Consideration.

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, AMID shall cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common
Units whose Common Units were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration an amount of AMID Units (which shall be in non-certificated
book-entry form) issuable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Units pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Following the Effective
Time, AMID agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time
as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(g)_, any AMID Units sufficient to pay any Merger
Consideration and any that may be payable from time

 



4  to time following the Effective Time. All cash or book-entry units
representing AMID Units deposited with the Exchange Agent or representing AMID
Units to be delivered pursuant to _Section 2.2(h)_ shall be referred to in
this Agreement as the "Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
issued or paid pursuant to this _Article II_ out of the Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(c) _Exchange_. Each holder of Common Units that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a Book-Entry Unit or a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto and a
Certificate and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the
number of AMID Units representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of AMID
Units that such holder has the right to receive in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article II_ and/or (y) a check denominated in U.S. dollars
in the amount of cash, if any, that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this _Article II_. The Merger Consideration shall be paid as
promptly as practicable by mail after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the
Book-Entry Unit or Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with
the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration or on any unpaid distributions payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Units. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate
or Book-Entry Unit shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. The Merger
Consideration paid upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Units shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Common Units, as the case may be, formerly represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Units.

(d) _Other Payees_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit is registered, it shall
be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate
or Book-Entry Unit shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar
Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Unit or establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration on the books of SXE of transfers of Common Units.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Units representing Common Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Units,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Units are presented to
the Exchange Agent or AMID, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this _Article II_.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Common Unitholders 12 months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to AMID, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged such holders

 



5  Common Units for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 2.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to AMID for delivery
of the Merger Consideration as applicable, in respect of such holders Common
Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AMID and SXE shall not be liable to any
Common Unitholder for any Merger Consideration duly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by Common Unitholders immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of,
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of AMID free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Distributions_. No distributions with respect to AMID Units issued in the
Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-
Entry Units until such Certificates or Book-Entry Units are surrendered as
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. Following such surrender, subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the record holder of the AMID Units, if any, issued in
exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all distributions payable
in respect of any such AMID Units with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not
previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the distributions
payable with respect to such AMID Units with a record date after the Effective
Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of
distributions in respect of AMID Units, all AMID Units to be issued pursuant
to the Merger shall be entitled to distributions pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(h) _No Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
AMID Units shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Book-Entry Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, all
fractional AMID Units that a holder of Common Units converted pursuant to the
Merger would otherwise be entitled to receive as Merger Consideration (after
taking into account all Certificates or Book-Entry Units delivered by such
holder) will be aggregated and then, if a fractional AMID Unit results from
that aggregation, be rounded up to the nearest whole AMID Unit.

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by AMID, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as AMID may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Common Units represented by
such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. AMID and the Exchange Agent shall deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to a Common Unitholder such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding is required, such
deduction and withholding shall be taken in AMID Units). To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this

 



6  Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Common Units, as
applicable, in respect of whom such withholding was made. If withholding is
taken in AMID Units, AMID and the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having
sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value
of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash
proceeds to the appropriate Tax authority.

 

(k) _Tax Characterization of the Merger_. The Parties hereby acknowledge that,
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the Merger will be treated as an
"assets-over" partnership merger transaction under Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby, SXE will be
the terminating partnership and AMID will be the resulting partnership and,
as a result, the Merger will qualify in part for nonrecognition of gain or
loss pursuant to Section 721 of the Code and will be characterized as a
disguised sale transaction described in Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code with
respect to the cash consideration, if any, and any liabilities assumed in the
transaction (other than "qualified liabilities" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.707-5(a)(6) to the extent provided in the Treasury
Regulations) (the "Section 707 Consideration"). Each Party agrees to prepare
and file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance with the foregoing
and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on any such Tax Return,
or in the course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
U.S. federal income Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws
following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
final administrative decision by an applicable Governmental Authority.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of the SXE LTIP_ _Units_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each award of SXE LTIP Units that is then outstanding shall
be fully vested and settled in the form of Common Units, provided that SXE
shall withhold a portion of the Common Units that would otherwise be delivered
upon vesting an amount equal to any applicable federal, state and local
taxes, and the holder of such Common Units shall receive the consideration
provided under _Section 2.1(a)_ above. Any tandem dividend equivalent right
issued in connection with an award of SXE LTIP Units shall be settled as soon
as administratively feasible following the Effective Time. As of the Effective
Time, AMID shall assume such plans for purposes of employing such plans to
make grants of equity based awards on AMID Units following the Closing.

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article II_
to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in _Section_
__ _ 5.2_), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
number of outstanding Common Units or AMID Units shall have been changed into
a different number of units or a different class by reason of the occurrence
or record date of any unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, split-up, unit distribution, unit combination,
exchange of units or similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such unit dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, unit
distribution, unit combination, exchange of units or similar transaction and
to provide the holders of Common Units the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 2.5 _No Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

other applicable power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its

qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location

the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the SXE Entities and, assuming due authorization, execution

reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights and remedies generally and by
general principles of equity (whether applied in a Proceeding or at law or in
equity).

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the SXE Entities
nor the consummation by the SXE Entities of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by the SXE Entities with any of the terms or provisions
of this Agreement, will (i) assuming that the SXE Unitholder Approval is

contract or other agreement (including any SXE Material Contract), instrument
or obligation (each, a "Contract") or SXE Permit (including any Environmental
Permit) to which SXE or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected or

material asset of SXE or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of
_clauses (ii)(x)_ and _(ii)(y)_ , for such violations, conflicts, losses,

Effect.

Section 3.5 _SXE SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

(a) SXE and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports, schedules,
forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other
statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31, 2014
(collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis on
Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the "SXE SEC Documents"). The SXE
SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of the SXE
SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other SXE SEC Documents), or, if amended, as
finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), as the case
may be, applicable to such SXE SEC Documents, and none of the SXE SEC
Documents as of such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from
the SEC staff with respect to the SXE SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of SXE,
none of the SXE SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or
investigation.

 



11 (b) The consolidated financial statements of SXE included in the SXE SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of SXE and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners equity for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to SXE and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

(c) SXE has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to SXE, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed by SXE in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to SXEs principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by SXE in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. SXEs
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to SXEs auditors and the
audit committee of the SXE GP Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect SXEs
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
identified for SXEs auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and
(y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in SXEs internal controls. The
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of SXE have
made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act
and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to
the SXE SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
were complete and correct when made. The management of SXE has completed its
assessment of the effectiveness of SXEs internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2016, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of SXE, as of the date of
this Agreement there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer from giving the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance
sheet of SXE and its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017 (the "Balance Sheet

by SXE and publicly available prior to the 

 



12  date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred since
the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business and (iii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred under or in accordance with this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, neither
SXE nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether or not accrued or contingent), that would be required to be
reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of SXE prepared
in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than as have not and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
SXE Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Neither SXE nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among SXE and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, SXE in SXEs published financial statements or any
SXE SEC Documents.

Section 3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been a SXE Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, SXE and its Subsidiaries have carried on
and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither SXE
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in
_Section 5.2(a)_ that, if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time without the prior written consent of AMID, would violate
such provision.

 

Section 3.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or proceedings
pending (or, to the Knowledge of SXE, threatened) by any Governmental
Authority with respect to SXE or any of its Subsidiaries or actions, suits or

any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, at law or in
equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are no orders, judgments
or decrees of any Governmental Authority against SXE or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a SXE Material Adverse
Effect.

(a) SXE and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December 31, 2014
and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or organization have
been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any
applicable federal, state, local or foreign or provincial law,
statute, tariff, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction,
stipulation, determination, award or decree or agency requirement of or
undertaking to any

 



13  Governmental Authority, including common law (collectively, "Laws" and each,
a "Law"), except where such non-compliance, default or violation would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a SXE Material Adverse Effect.

(b) SXE and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits (including
Environmental Permits) necessary for SXE and its Subsidiaries to own, lease
and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as

have any of the SXE Permits would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a SXE Material Adverse Effect. All SXE Permits are in full force and effect,
except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a SXE Material Adverse Effect. No suspension
or cancellation of any of the SXE Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of
SXE, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a SXE Material Adverse Effect. SXE and its
Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2014 have not been, in violation
or breach of, or default under, any SXE Permit, except where such violation,
breach or default would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a SXE
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of
SXE, no event or condition has occurred or exists which would result in a
violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of
an obligation of SXE or any of its Subsidiaries under, any SXE Permit, or has
caused (or would cause) an applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse
to issue, renew or extend any SXE Permit (in each case, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both), except for violations, breaches, defaults,
losses, accelerations or failures that would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a SXE Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of SXE, each joint venture partner, joint
interest owner, consultant, agent, or representative of any of the foregoing

been) investigated by any Governmental Authority except, in each case of the
foregoing _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ , as would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a SXE Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.9  _Information Supplied_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of AMID set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.9_, none
of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on behalf of
SXE specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the

other obligations, to the SXE Brokers in connection with the Merger or any
other transaction on behalf of SXE and its Affiliates.

to which SXE is a party or otherwise bound.

21  or has made any express or implied representation or warranty with respect
to SXE GP, SXE or its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information

this Agreement, the AMID Entities represent and warrant, jointly and
severally, to the SXE Entities as follows:

Section 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

(a) Each of AMID, AMID GP and their respective Subsidiaries is a legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, formed or organized, as applicable,
and has all requisite partnership, corporate, limited liability company or
other applicable power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on AMID (a
"AMID Material Adverse Effect").

(b) Each of AMID, AMID GP and their respective Subsidiaries is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed,
qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have an AMID Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) All the outstanding partnership interests, limited liability company
interests, shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
material Subsidiary of AMID that are owned directly or indirectly by AMID have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable

Section  4.2 _Capitalization_.

set forth above in this _Section 4.2(a)_ , or (B) as otherwise permitted by 
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, as of the date of this Agreement there are not, and
as of the Effective Time there will not be, any AMID Partnership Interests or
other limited partnership interests, voting securities or other

Section 4.3 _Authority;_ _Noncontravention_ _; Voting Requirements_.

 

(a) Each of the AMID Entities has all necessary power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger. The execution, delivery and performance by the
AMID Entities of this Agreement, the Holdings Contribution Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including
the Merger, have been duly authorized and approved by all requisite
partnership or limited liability company action on the part of each of the
AMID Entities. At a meeting duly called and held, the AMID GP Board
unanimously approved this Agreement, the Holdings Contribution Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger and the
Holdings Contribution, and no other entity action on the part of the AMID
Entities is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by
the AMID Entities of this Agreement and the Holdings Contribution Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger and the Holdings Contribution. This Agreement and
the Holdings Contribution Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by
the applicable AMID Entities and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Holdings Contribution Agreement by the
other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of the applicable AMID Entities, enforceable against each
of them in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights and remedies generally and by general principles of equity
(whether applied in a Proceeding or at law or in equity).

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of each of this Agreement and the
Holdings Contribution Agreement by the AMID Entities, nor the consummation by
the AMID Entities of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, nor
compliance by the AMID Entities with any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement, will (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the
AMID Charter Documents, the AMID GP Charter Documents, or any of the AMID
Subsidiary Documents, (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and
approvals referred to in _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ are obtained and the filings
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ are made, (x) violate any Law, judgment,

constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of
termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the

 



24  creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of,
AMID or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract or AMID Permit (including any Environmental
Permit) to which AMID or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected or
(iii) result in the exercisability of any right to purchase or acquire any
material asset of AMID or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of
_clauses (ii)(x)_ and _(ii)(y)_ , for such violations, conflicts, losses,
defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or Liens as, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an AMID
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) None of the AMID Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries holds
any limited partner interests, capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests of SXE or any of its Subsidiaries, or holds any securities or rights
convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or evidencing the right to
subscribe for any such limited partner interests, shares of capital stock,
voting securities or equity interests, or any rights, warrants, options,
calls, commitments or any other agreements of any character to purchase or
acquire any such limited partner interests, shares of capital stock, voting
securities or equity interests or any securities or rights convertible into,
exchangeable or exercisable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for, any
such limited partner interests, shares of capital stock, voting securities or
equity interests.

Section 4.4  _Governmental Approvals_. Except for (i) filings required under,

Securities Act, including the filing of the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement with the SEC, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (iii) filings required

approvals of, or filings, declarations or registrations with, any Governmental
Authority are necessary for the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by AMID and the consummation by AMID of the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than such other consents, approvals, filings,
declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an
AMID Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.5 _AMID SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) AMID and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports, schedules,
forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other
statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31, 2014
(collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis on
Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the "AMID SEC Documents"). The
AMID SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of the
AMID SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other AMID SEC Documents), or, if amended, as
finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such AMID SEC Documents,
and none of the AMID SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order

 



25  to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect
to the AMID SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of AMID, none of the AMID SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of AMID included in the AMID SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of AMID and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners equity for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to AMID and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 

(c) AMID has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to AMID, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed by AMID in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to AMIDs principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by AMID in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. AMIDs
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to AMIDs auditors and the
audit and risk committee of the AMID GP Board (x) all significant deficiencies
in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect
AMIDs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and
have identified for AMIDs auditors any material weaknesses in internal
controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in AMIDs internal
controls. The principal executive officer and the principal financial officer
of AMID have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the
Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with
respect to the AMID SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications were complete and correct when made. The management of AMID has
completed its assessment of the effectiveness of AMIDs internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2016, and such assessment
concluded that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of AMID, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are no facts or circumstances that would
prevent its principal executive officer and principal financial officer from
giving the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

 



26 (d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet
of AMID and its Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date (including the
notes thereto) included in the AMID SEC Documents filed by AMID and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and
obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither AMID nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of AMID prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) Neither AMID nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among AMID and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, AMID in AMIDs published financial statements or any
AMID SEC Documents.

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been an AMID Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, AMID and its Subsidiaries have carried on
and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither
AMID nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in
_Section 5.2(b)_ that, if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time without the prior written consent of SXE, would violate
such provision.

 

Section 4.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or proceedings
pending (or, to the Knowledge of AMID, threatened) by any Governmental
Authority with respect to AMID or any of its Subsidiaries or actions, suits or
proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of AMID, threatened) against AMID or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, at law or in
equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are no orders, judgments
or decrees of any Governmental Authority against AMID or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse
Effect.

Section  4.8 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

(a) AMID and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December 31, 2014
and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or organization have
been, in compliance

 



27  with and are not in default under or in violation of any applicable Laws,
except where such non-compliance, default or violation would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect.

(b) AMID and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits (including
Environmental Permits) necessary for AMID and its Subsidiaries to own, lease
and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as
they are now being conducted (the "AMID Permits"), except where the failure
to have any of the AMID Permits would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect. All AMID Permits are in full force
and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the AMID Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of AMID, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse
Effect. AMID and its Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2014 have
not been, in violation or breach of, or default under, any AMID Permit, except
where such violation, breach or default would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of AMID, no event or condition has occurred or
exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a
benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of AMID or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any AMID Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend
any AMID Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 4.8(a)_ , AMID, each of its
Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of AMID, each joint venture partner,
joint interest owner, consultant, agent, or representative of any of the
foregoing (in their respective capacities as such), (i) has not violated the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any other U.S. and foreign anti-
corruption Laws that are applicable to AMID or its Subsidiaries; (ii) has
not, to the Knowledge of AMID, been given written notice by any Governmental
Authority of any facts which, if true, would constitute a violation of the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other U.S. or foreign anti-
corruption Laws by any such person; and (iii) to the Knowledge of AMID, is not
being (and has not been) investigated by any Governmental Authority except, in
each case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect.

Section  4.9 _Information Supplied_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of SXE set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.9_, none
of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on behalf of
AMID specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC or at the time
it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (b) the
Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to SXE Unitholders, and
at the time of the SXE Unitholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances

 



28  under which they are made, not misleading. The Registration Statement and
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, AMID makes no representation or warranty with
respect to information supplied by or on behalf of SXE for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in any of the foregoing documents.

 

Section 4.10 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) All Tax Returns that were required to be filed by or with respect to AMID
or any of its Subsidiaries have been duly and timely filed (taking into
account any extension of time within which to file) and all such Tax Returns
are true, complete and accurate in all material respects. All items of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit or other items required to be included in
each such Tax Returns have been so included. All Taxes owed by AMID or any of
its Subsidiaries that are or have become due have been timely paid in full or
an adequate reserve for the payment of such Taxes has been established.

 

(b) There are no audits, examinations, investigations or other legal
proceedings pending or threatened with respect to Taxes or with respect to

individually or $1,000,000 in the aggregate, and do not include any equitable
remedies or other restrictions binding on SXE beyond such cash settlement; or

written consent or denial of consent with respect thereto within five Business
Days after such request is sent to the Designated AMID Representatives, AMID
shall be deemed to have consented to such action; provided that if AMID

(b) Except (i) as expressly permitted by this Agreement, (ii) as set forth in
_Section 5.2(b)_ of the AMID Disclosure Schedule, (iii) as required by
applicable Law or (iv) as consented to in writing by SXE (which consent shall

Schedule, (iii) as required by applicable Law, or (iv) as consented to in
writing by SXE (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, AMID shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to:

 

(i) (A) Except for (y) distributions by a direct or indirect Subsidiary of
AMID to its parent or (z) AMIDs regular quarterly distributions and

a material way the rights of holders of its securities or the securities of
any other Party hereto;

consummation of the transactions set forth in this Agreement or (B) adversely
affect in a material way the rights of holders of the securities of any Party
hereto;

(vi) change its fiscal year or any material method of Tax accounting, (B)
make, change or revoke any material Tax election, (C) take any action or fail

less than 90% of the gross income of AMID for any calendar quarter since its

(vii) agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) SXE and SXE GP shall, and SXE shall cause its Subsidiaries and use
reasonable best efforts to cause SXEs and its Subsidiaries respective
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to a SXE Alternative Proposal, request the return or destruction of
all confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on
behalf of SXE or its Subsidiaries and immediately prohibit any access by any
Person (other than AMID and its Representatives) to any physical or electronic
data room relating to a possible SXE Alternative Proposal. Except as permitted
by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, (x) SXE and SXE GP shall not, and SXE shall
cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
confidential information) or knowingly induce or take any other action
intended to lead to any inquiries or any proposals that constitute the
submission of a SXE Alternative Proposal, (ii) grant approval to any Person
under clause (iii) of the provision in the definition of "Outstanding" in the
SXE Partnership Agreement, (iii) enter into any confidentiality agreement,
merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, unit purchase
agreement, asset purchase agreement or unit exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement relating to a SXE Alternative

 



41  Proposal or (iv) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to AMID, the SXE Board
Recommendation or publicly recommend the approval or adoption of, or publicly
approve or adopt, or propose to publicly recommend, approve or adopt, any SXE
Alternative Proposal and (y) within ten business days of receipt of a written
request of AMID following the receipt by SXE of any SXE Alternative Proposal,
SXE shall publicly reconfirm the SXE Board Recommendation; _provided that_
AMID shall not be permitted to make such request on more than one occasion in
respect of each SXE Alternative Proposal and each material modification to a
SXE Alternative Proposal, if any (the taking of any action described in
_clause_ __ _ (x)(iv)_ or the failure to take the action described in _clause
(y_ ) being referred to as an "SXE Adverse Recommendation Change"). Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by SXEs Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by SXE unless such violation is
committed without the Knowledge of SXE and SXE uses its reasonable best
efforts to promptly cure such violation once SXE is made aware of such
violation.

 

(b) In addition to the other obligations of SXE set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 5.3_, SXE shall promptly advise AMID, orally and in writing, and in no
event later than 48 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, SXE
in respect of any SXE Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to
AMID, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry
or other contact and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with
such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter
shall promptly keep AMID reasonably informed of all material developments
affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or
requests (and SXE shall promptly provide AMID with copies of any additional
written materials received by SXE or that SXE has delivered to any third
party making a SXE Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior
to obtaining the SXE Unitholder Approval, the SXE GP Board (upon the
recommendation of the SXE Conflicts Committee) may effect a SXE Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a SXE Designated Proposal or a SXE
Changed Circumstance if the SXE GP Board, after consultation with SXE GPs
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that
the failure to take such action would not be in the best interest of SXE and
would be inconsistent with its duties under the SXE Partnership Agreement and
applicable Law and:

 

(i) if the SXE GP Board intends to effect such SXE Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a SXE Designated Proposal:

 

(A) such SXE Alternative Proposal is bona fide, in writing and has not been
withdrawn or abandoned;

 

(B) the SXE GP Board has determined, after consultation with SXE GPs outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that such SXE Alternative Proposal
constitutes a SXE Designated Proposal;

 



42 (C) SXE has provided prior written notice to AMID in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 8.9_ (the "SXE Designated Proposal Notice") of the SXE GP
Boards intention to effect a SXE Adverse Recommendation Change, and such SXE
Designated Proposal Notice has specified the identity of the Person making
such SXE Alternative Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such SXE
Alternative Proposal, and complete copies of any written proposal or offers
(including proposed agreements) received by SXE in connection with such
SXE Alternative Proposal;

(D) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the SXE
Designated Proposal Notice as determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.9_ and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth
calendar day following the date of such delivery (the "SXE Designated Proposal
Notice Period"), SXE shall (1) negotiate with AMID in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
SXE GP Board not to effect a SXE Adverse Recommendation Change; and (2) keep
AMID reasonably informed with respect to the status and changes in the
material terms and conditions of such SXE Alternative Proposal or other change
in circumstances related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that any material
revisions to such SXE Alternative Proposal (it being agreed that any change
in the form, amount or timing of payment of consideration in such SXE
Alternative Proposal shall be deemed a material revision) shall require
delivery of a subsequent SXE Designated Proposal Notice and a subsequent SXE
Designated Proposal Notice Period in respect of such revised SXE Alternative
Proposal, except that such subsequent SXE Designated Proposal Notice Period
shall expire upon the later of (x) the end of the initial SXE Designated
Proposal Notice Period and (y) 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the
third calendar day following the date of the delivery of such subsequent SXE
Designated Proposal Notice; and

 

(E) the SXE GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms of this
Agreement offered in writing by AMID and, at the end of the SXE Designated
Proposal Notice Period, shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with SXE GPs financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
(i) such SXE Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a SXE Designated
Proposal even if such revisions were to be given effect and (ii) failure to
effect a SXE Adverse Recommendation Change would not be in the best interest
of SXE and would be inconsistent with its duties under the SXE
Partnership Agreement and applicable Law even if such revisions were to be
given effect; or

(ii) if the SXE GP Board intends to effect such SXE Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a SXE Changed Circumstance:

 



43 (A) SXE has provided prior written notice to AMID in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 8.9_ (the "SXE Recommendation Change Notice") of the SXE GP
Boards intention to effect a SXE Adverse Recommendation Change, and such SXE
Recommendation Change Notice has specified the details of such SXE Changed
Circumstance and the reasons for the SXE Adverse Recommendation Change;

(B) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the SXE
Recommendation Change Notice as determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.9_ and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth
calendar day following the date of such delivery (the "SXE Recommendation
Change Notice Period"), SXE shall (i) negotiate with AMID in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the SXE GP Board not to effect a SXE Adverse Recommendation Change;
and (ii) keep AMID reasonably informed of any change in circumstances related
thereto; and

 

(C) the SXE GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms of this
Agreement offered in writing by AMID and, at the end of the SXE
Recommendation Change Notice Period, shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with SXE GPs financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to effect a SXE Adverse Recommendation Change would not
be in the best interest of SXE and would be inconsistent with its duties
under the SXE Partnership Agreement and applicable Law even if such revisions
were to be given effect.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent SXE or the SXE GP Board
from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
under the Exchange Act with respect to a SXE Alternative Proposal if the SXE
GP Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that its failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a
violation of applicable Law; _provided_ that any SXE Adverse Recommendation
Change may only be made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, a public statement that describes SXEs receipt of a SXE
Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not be deemed to be a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ or a SXE
Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section
5.4(d)), each of the AMID Entities, on the one hand, and the SXE Entities, on
the other hand, shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other in doing, all things, necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law to cause the conditions to the Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date) and to consummate and make

 



44  effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including preparing and filing promptly and fully with
any Governmental Authority all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of

recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain promptly
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date) and maintain all approvals,
consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,

other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seek
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or rescinded any injunction or restraining
order or other order that prohibits, prevents, restricts or otherwise
adversely affects the ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iv) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each Party
hereto (including by their respective Subsidiaries) agrees to make an
appropriate filing (if required) of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable and in any event within 10 business days after the date of
this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed to by the Parties
hereto) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by their respective
Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event no later
than the Outside Date); and (ii) SXE and AMID shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (y) if any state takeover statute or
similar Law becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that such transaction may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the transaction.

 

(c) Each of the Parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including by providing the other Parties documents, information and a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon in advance, and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental
Authority relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform the other
Party of (and supply to the other Party) any communication received by such
Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) consult with the other Party prior to
taking any material position with respect to the

 



45  filings under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, or in discussions with
or filings to be submitted to any Governmental Authority or prior to entering
into any agreement with any Governmental Authority, (iv) permit the other
Party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other Party in connection with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be submitted to any Governmental
Authority with respect to filings under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Law, (v) coordinate with the other Party in preparing and exchanging such
information and promptly provide the other Party (and its counsel) with
copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any
oral presentations) made by such Party with any Governmental Authority
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law and (iv) consult with the other Party in advance of any
meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person, and, to the
extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other Person, give the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
teleconferences. AMID shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any clearances required under any
Antitrust Law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental
Authority in connection with obtaining such clearances,  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that AMID shall consult in advance with SXE and in good faith take
SXEs views into account regarding the overall strategy. Subject to _Section
5.6(b)_ , the Parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_ in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

(d) AMID and SXE (including by causing their respective Subsidiaries) agree to
use their reasonable best efforts to (x) resolve any objections that a
Governmental Authority or other Person may assert under any Antitrust Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (y) avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
in each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable
and in any event no later than the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this _clause_ __ _ (d)_ shall not impose any requirement on AMID
or SXE to (i) to dispose, transfer, or separate any assets or operations, (ii)
limit AMIDs freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate
and control, SXE or any of their assets or businesses or any of AMIDs or its
Affiliates other assets or businesses or (iii) limit AMIDs ability to
acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership with respect to, SXE.

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by AMID and SXE. Thereafter, neither SXE nor AMID shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with
this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with the NYSE or other
national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
Party proposing to make such release (in which case such Party shall not
issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with

 



46  the other Party); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) SXE shall not be
required by this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ to consult with any other Party with
respect to a public announcement in connection with a SXE Adverse
Recommendation Change but nothing in this clause (a) shall limit any
obligation of SXE under _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3_;
provided, further, that each Party and their respective controlled affiliates
may make statements that are consistent with statements made in previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made by AMID or SXE in
compliance with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.5_.

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the other Party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records,
the right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in each case,
whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives. Each Party shall
furnish promptly to the other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule and
other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including
"comment letters") received by such Party from the SEC concerning compliance
with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the other Party may
reasonably request (including information necessary to prepare the Proxy
Statement). No Parties access hereunder shall include the collection or
analysis of samples, or any invasive or subsurface investigation of property
without the other Parties prior written consent, which consent may be
withheld or conditioned in the other Parties sole discretion. Except for
disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as
of March 9, 2017, between AMID and Southcross Holdings (as it may be amended
from time to time, the "AMID Confidentiality Agreement"), each Party and its
Representatives shall hold information received from the other Party pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of
the AMID Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) This _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall not require either Party to permit any
access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith
judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of
such Party would reasonably be expected to result in (A) any violation of any
contract or Law to which such Party or its Subsidiaries is a Party or is
subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such
Party or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be
undermined with respect to such information and such undermining of such
privilege could in such Partys good faith judgment (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) adversely affect in any material
respect such Partys position in any pending or, what such Party believes in
good faith (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)
could be, future litigation or (B) if such Party or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, are adverse Parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably
pertinent thereto; _provided_ that, in the case of  _clause (A)_ , the
Parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of
such information (including by entering into a joint-defense or similar
agreement) to the extent doing so (1) would not (in the good faith belief of
the Party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel))

 



47  reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such contract or Law
or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect
to such information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the
Party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which appropriately
designated Representatives of the other Party shall be provided access to such
information; _provided_ , further, that the Party being requested to disclose
the information shall (x) notify the other Party that such disclosures are
reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any
such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined, (y) communicate to the other Party in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to such notification and the subject matter of such information
(to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with the first proviso in
this _Section 5.6(b)_ ) and (z) in the case where such disclosures are
reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any
contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek consent from the
applicable third Party to any such contract with respect to the disclosures
prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly prohibited by the
terms of such contract).

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 5.6_ will modify any of the representations and warranties of the Parties
hereto.

 

(d) If the SXE Entities on the one hand or the AMID Entities on the other hand
exercise rights of access under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ or otherwise (the
"Inspecting Parties"), or conduct examinations or inspections under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_ or otherwise, then (i) such access, examination
and inspection will be at the Inspecting Parties sole risk, cost and expense
and such Inspecting Parties waive and release, on behalf of themselves and
each Person undertaking any such examination or inspection on their behalf,
all damages, losses, liabilities, fines, penalties and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) and other claims against the other Parties and
their partners and members and their Affiliates and the respective employees,
directors, officers, attorneys, contractors, Representatives and agents of
such Persons (collectively the "Inspection Indemnitees") arising in any way
therefrom or in any way related thereto and (ii) except to the extent of an
Inspection Indemnitees gross negligence or willful misconduct, the
Inspecting Parties will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Inspection
Indemnitees from and against any and all damages, losses, liabilities, fines,
penalties and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) and other
claims of any kind or character arising out of the granting of any such access
or the undertaking of any such examination or inspection. THE FOREGOING
RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES, LOSSES,

except (a) SXE or AMID may have liability as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.3_,
and (b) nothing shall relieve any Party hereto from any liability or damages
for any failure to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby when required pursuant to this Agreement or any Party from

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) In the event that (A) a SXE Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly
proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the time of,
the date of the SXE Unitholders Meeting (or, if the SXE Unitholders Meeting
shall not have occurred, and such SXE Alternative Proposal shall have not been
withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(i)_ [ _Outside Date_ ]), (B) this Agreement is terminated by
SXE or AMID pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ [ _Outside Date_ ] or _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed SXE Unitholder Vote_ ], and (C) SXE enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any SXE Alternative
Proposal within 12 months after the date this Agreement is terminated (whether
or not such SXE Alternative Proposal is the same SXE Alternative Proposal
referred to in  _clause_ __ _ (A)_), then SXE shall pay to AMID a
termination fee equal to $2,000,000, less any AMID Expenses previously paid by
SXE pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)_ (the "SXE Termination Fee"), upon the
earlier of the public announcement that SXE has entered into such definitive
agreement or the consummation of any such transaction; provided, that the
payment by SXE of the SXE Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.3_ shall not relieve SXE from any liability or damage resulting from a
Willful Breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ hereof or
fraud. For purposes of this _Section 7.3(a)_ , the term "SXE Alternative
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section_ __ _
8.13_, except that the references to "25% or more" shall be deemed to be
references to "50% or more."

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by AMID pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 7.1(c)(i)_ [ _SXE Adverse Recommendation Change_ ], then SXE shall pay
to AMID, within two business days after the date of termination, the SXE
Termination Fee.

 

(c) Any payment of the SXE Termination Fee shall be made in cash by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated in writing by AMID.

(d) In the event that SXE shall fail to pay the SXE Termination Fee required
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ when due, such fee shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a
rate equal to the legal rate of interest provided for in Section 2301 of Title
6 of the Delaware Code. In addition, if SXE shall fail to pay the SXE
Termination Fee when due, SXE shall also pay all of AMIDs reasonable costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect
such fee. The SXE Entities acknowledge that the provisions of this  _Section_
__ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and
that, without these agreements the AMID Entities would enter into this
Agreement. The Parties agree that in no event shall SXE be required to
pay the SXE Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



58 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
of termination of this Agreement by (i) either Party pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed SXE Unitholder Vote_ ] (or a termination by SXE
pursuant to a different provision of _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ at a time when this
Agreement was terminable pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed SXE
Unitholder Vote_ ]) or (ii) AMID pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ [ _SXE
Uncured Breach_ ], then SXE shall promptly, but in no event later than three
business days after receipt of an invoice (with supporting documentation)
therefor from AMID, pay AMIDs designee all of the reasonably documented out-
of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and
consultants) incurred by AMID and its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "AMID Expenses");
_provided, however_ , that in the event of a termination of this Agreement by
either Party pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed SXE Unitholder Vote_
] (or a termination by SXE pursuant to a different provision of _Section_ __
_ 7.1_ at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed SXE Unitholder Vote_ ]), SXE shall pay the AMID
Expenses up to a maximum amount of $500,000; provided, further, that that the
payment by SXE of the AMID Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.3(e)_ , (i)
shall not relieve SXE of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ except to the extent indicated in such Section
and (ii) shall not relieve SXE from any liability or damage resulting from a
Willful Breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ hereof
or fraud. In no event shall SXE have any obligation to make any such payment
if, at the time of such termination, this Agreement was terminable by SXE
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ [ _AMID Uncured Breach_ ].

amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after
receipt of the SXE Unitholder Approval by written agreement of the Parties
hereto; provided, however, that following approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereunder by the SXE Unitholders, there shall be no
amendment or change to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law would
require further approval by the SXE Unitholders or AMID Unitholders, as
applicable, without such approval;

 



59  provided further, however, that any amendment or supplement to this
Agreement must be approved by the SXE Conflicts Committee. Unless otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, whenever a determination, decision,

Subsidiaries nor the SXE GP Board may make or authorize any such waiver or
extension without the prior approval of the SXE Conflicts Committee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any SXE Entity or any
AMID Entity in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such Party.

 

Section 8.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of all other Parties except that (a) AMID may assign, in its sole

relieve AMID of any of its obligations hereunder, (b) SXE may assign, in its
sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of SXE, but no such assignment
shall relieve SXE of any of its obligations hereunder and (c) AMID may assign

effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties. The delivery of signed
counterparts by facsimile or email transmission which includes a copy of the
sending partys signature(s) is as effective as signing and delivering the

Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the Holdings Contribution Agreement, the Support Agreement, the SXE
Disclosure Schedule, the

 



60  AMID Disclosure Schedule and the AMID Confidentiality Agreement (a)
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and thereof and (b) shall not confer upon any
Person other than the Parties hereto any rights (including third-party
beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies hereunder, except for, in the

_Section_ __ _ 8.12_ and (ii) if and only if the Closing occurs, the right of

Section 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

(b) Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
Parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally
and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
8.7_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 



61 Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.8_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(x) either Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.
Each Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain, furnish
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.8_, and each
Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. The Parties
agree that in the event that AMID receives the SXE Termination Fee, AMID may
not seek any award of specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 8.8_.

Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy,
all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

Section 8.11 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of,
or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto

 



63  unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of
such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. All references in this Agreement to "transactions
contemplated hereby" includes the Merger, but does not include the Holdings
Contribution. References to the "other Party" from the perspective of an AMID
Entity, refers to the SXE Entities, and from the perspective of a SXE Entity,
refers to the AMID Entities.

 

(b) The Parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement with the assistance of counsel and, in the event
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as jointly drafted by the Parties hereto and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or interim drafts of this
Agreement.

(c) The Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement are arranged in sections
corresponding to those contained in this Agreement merely for convenience, and
the disclosure of an item in one section or subsection of such Disclosure
Schedules as an exception to any particular covenant, representation
or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect
to all other covenants, representations or warranties, notwithstanding the
presence or absence of an appropriate section or subsection of such Disclosure
Schedules with respect to such other covenants, representations or warranties
or an appropriate cross-reference thereto, in each case to the extent
relevancy of such disclosure to such other covenants, representations or
warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such
disclosed information is applicable thereto. Additionally, for each of the
Disclosure Schedules, the mere inclusion of an item in such Disclosure
Schedules as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the
inclusion of such information in such Disclosure Schedules, that such
information is required to be listed in such Disclosure Schedules or that such
item (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater
significance) represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance,
that such item has had, or is expected to result in, a SXE Material
Adverse Effect or a AMID Material Adverse Effect, that such item actually
constitutes noncompliance with, or a violation of, any Law, Permit or contract
or other topic to which such disclosure is applicable or that such item is
outside the ordinary course of business. The specification of any dollar
amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or
the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules is not intended
to imply that such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or are not
material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure Schedules in any
dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation,
item, or matter not described herein or included in a Disclosure Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Capitalized terms used in
the Disclosure Schedules, unless otherwise defined therein, shall have the
meanings assigned to them in this Agreement.

 



64 Section 8.12  _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney,
representative or affiliate of any Party hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates (unless such Affiliate is expressly a Party to this Agreement)
shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations
or liabilities of such Party arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
