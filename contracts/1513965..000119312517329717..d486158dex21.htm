AMID, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by AMID in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to AMID&#146;s principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AMID in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. AMID&#146;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to AMID&#146;s
auditors and the audit and risk committee of the AMID GP Board (x)&nbsp;all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect AMID&#146;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data and have identified for AMID&#146;s auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in AMID&#146;s internal controls.
The principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of AMID have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the AMID SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct when made. The management of AMID has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of AMID&#146;s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with
the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of AMID, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no facts
or circumstances that would prevent its principal executive officer and principal financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the
