and delivering any document) in the name and on behalf  of either the Company
or the Merger Sub in order to carry out and  effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   7   (ii) CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION.

the Surviving Corporation shall be amended  and restated at and as of the
Effective Time to read as did the  bylaws of the Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time  (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation
will remain  unchanged).   (iv) DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The directors of
the Merger Sub shall  become the directors of the Surviving Corporation at
and as of  the Effective Time, and the officers of the Surviving
Corporation  from and after the Effective Time shall be as set forth in 
Section 2(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.   (v) CONVERSION OF COMPANY
SHARES.   (A) At and as of the Effective Time, and without any action on 
the part of the Parties hereto or any holder of the Company  Shares, each
Company Share issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective
Time, by virtue of this Merger, shall be  converted automatically into the
right to receive one and seven  tenths (1.7) fully paid and nonassessable
Parent Shares (the  "Merger Consideration") subject to the terms and
provisions set  forth in this Section 2.   (B) Each Company Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time shall automatically
be redeemed and  canceled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and  each holder of a certificate representing any such Company Share  shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the  right to receive
the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of  fractional Parent Shares to
be issued or paid in consideration  therefor upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with  Section 2(d)(ix) hereof, without
interest.   (C) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company, if 
any, and each Company Share, if any, owned by Parent or Merger  Sub, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall  be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and  no payment or distribution
shall be made with respect thereto.   8   (vi) CONVERSION OF COMPANY STOCK
OPTIONS.   (A) At and as of the Effective Time, and without any action on 
the part of the holder thereof, each then outstanding option to  purchase
Company Shares shall be converted into an option to  purchase Parent Shares
in the manner set forth in Section 5(q);  provided, that in any event any
such conversion shall be in  accordance with the terms and conditions of all
applicable  Company Stock Option Plans, option agreements thereunder, and
all  other relevant documentation immediately prior to the Effective 
Time.   (B) The Company and its Board of Directors shall promptly take  all
actions necessary to ensure that following the Effective Time  no holder of
any options or other rights pursuant to, nor any  participant in or party to,
the Company Stock Option Plans or any  other Benefit Plan or other plan,
program, arrangement, agreement  or other commitment providing for the
issuance or grant of any  interest in respect of the capital stock of the
Company or any  Subsidiary of the Company will have any rights thereunder
to  acquire equity securities, or any right to payment in respect of  the
equity securities, of Parent, the Company, or the Surviving  Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries, except as provided  herein.   (vii) ADJUSTMENT
OF MERGER CONSIDERATION. Without limiting any of the  provisions of this
Agreement, the Merger Consideration shall be  adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse  split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of  securities convertible into Parent Shares or
Company Shares),  reorganization, recapitalization or other like change
with  respect to Parent Shares of Company Shares occurring after the  date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   (viii) CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK
OF THE MERGER SUB. At and as of the  Effective Time, each share of common
stock, $.01 par value per  share, of the Merger Sub shall be converted
automatically into  one share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of
the  Surviving Corporation and shall thereafter constitute all of the 
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving  Corporation. Each
stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing  ownership of any shares of Merger
Sub common stock shall, after  the Effective Time, evidence ownership of such
shares of capital  stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (ix) FRACTIONAL
SHARES. No certificates or scrip representing  fractional Parent Shares shall
be issued in connection with the  Merger, and such fractional interests will
not entitle the owner  thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In
lieu  thereof, each holder of Company Shares exchanged pursuant to  Section
2(d)(v) or of options or warrants exchanged pursuant to   9   Section
2(d)(vi) who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of  a Parent Share
(after aggregating all fractional Parent Shares to  have been otherwise
received by such holder) shall receive from  Parent an amount of cash
(rounded down to the nearest whole cent  and without interest) equal to the
product of such fractional  part of a Parent Share multiplied by the average
closing price  per Parent Share (rounded to the nearest cent) on the Nasdaq 
National Market (as reported in the Wall Street Journal, or, if  not reported
therein, any other authoritative source selected by  Parent) for the ten (10)
trading days ending on the date two (2)  trading days immediately prior to
(and excluding the date of) the  Effective Time.   (e) PROCEDURE FOR
PAYMENT.   (i) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall 
designate a bank or trust company to act as the Exchange Agent in  the Merger
(the "Exchange Agent").   (ii) PARENT TO PROVIDE PARENT SHARES. When and as
needed, Parent shall  make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance  with this Section 2, through such reasonable procedures as
Parent  may adopt, sufficient Parent Shares to be exchanged pursuant to 
Section 2(d).   (iii) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective
Time, the  Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of 
record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") that 
represented as of the Effective Time outstanding Company Shares  to be
exchanged pursuant to Section 2, a letter of transmittal  (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of  loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery  of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such  form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably  specify) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of  the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
Parent  Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, 
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and  validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and  such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such  instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to  receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the  number of whole Parent Shares and payment in
lieu of fractional  shares which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to  Sections 2(d)(v) and 2(d)(vi), after giving effect to any 
required Taxes, and the Certificate so surrendered shall  forthwith be
canceled. At any time following six (6) months after  the Effective Time, all
or any number of Parent Shares (and any  or all cash payable in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares)  deposited with or made available to the Exchange
Agent which  remain undistributed to the holders of the Certificates  
10   representing Company Shares, shall be delivered to Parent upon 
demand, and thereafter such holders of unexchanged Company Shares  shall be
entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned  property, escheat or
other similar Law) only as general creditors  thereof with respect to the
Parent Shares for payment upon due  surrender of their Certificates.   (iv)
DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or  other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time  with respect to
Parent Shares with a record date after the  Effective Time will be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered  Certificate with respect to the whole Parent
Shares represented  thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate
shall  surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable Law, following 
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the  record holder
of the certificates representing whole Parent  Shares issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, at the time  of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions  with a record date after the Effective Time
and payable between  the Effective Time and the time of such surrender with
respect to  such whole Parent Shares.   (v) TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If any
certificate for Parent Shares is  to be issued in a name other than the name
in which the  Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered,
it  will be a condition of the issuance thereof that (A) the  Certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and  otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person  requesting such exchange will have paid any
transfer or other  Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for  Parent Shares in a name other than the name of the registered  holder
of the Certificate surrendered or (B) established to the  satisfaction of
Parent, or any agent designated by Parent, that  such Taxes have been paid or
are not applicable.   (vi) NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, or the
Surviving  Corporation shall be liable to a holder of a Certificate for any 
Parent Shares (and any cash payable for fractional Parent Shares  or any
other amount due, if any) that was properly delivered to a  public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,  escheat or similar Law.  
(vii) WITHHOLDING OF TAX. Parent or the Exchange Agent will be  entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise  payable pursuant to

any Affiliate thereof) or the  Exchange Agent shall determine in good faith
they are required to  deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment  under the Code, or any provision of federal, state, local or

all rights pertaining to such Company  Shares. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the  Company shall be closed, and thereafter there
shall be no further  registration of transfers of Company Shares on the
records of the  Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
the  holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of Company Shares 
outstanding shall cease to have any rights with respect to such  Company
Shares except as otherwise provided for herein. If, after  the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving  Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged  as provided in this Section
2.   (ix) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any 
Certificates evidencing Company Shares shall have been lost,  stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange  for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates, upon the making  of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, such Parent  Shares and cash for fractional shares, if
any, as may be required  pursuant to this Section 2; provided, however, that
Parent may,  in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance 
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed  Certificates to
deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably  direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against  Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect
to the Certificates  alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   (x)

on any such property which have  been removed or closed, have been removed or
closed in accordance with  applicable Environmental Laws.   For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Environmental Laws" means  the common law and all
applicable federal, state, local, and foreign  Laws, rules, regulations,
codes, or Orders issued, promulgated,  approved, or entered thereunder
relating to pollution or protection of  human health and safety or the
environment (including, without  limitation, ambient air, indoor air, surface
water, ground water, land  surface, subsurface strata, and natural resources
such as wetlands,  flora, fauna), including without limitation, Laws relating
to  emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases of Hazardous 
Materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the  manufacture,
processing, generation, distribution, use, treatment,  storage, disposal,
transport, or handling of Hazardous Materials. For  purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Hazardous Materials" means any  pollutant, contaminant,
toxic, hazardous or extremely hazardous  substance, constituent or waste, or
any other constituent, waste,   22   chemical, compound, material or
substance, including without  limitation, petroleum or any petroleum product,
including crude oil or  any fraction thereof, subject to regulation by or
that can give rise  to liability under any Environmental Law. For purposes of
this  Agreement, the term "Environmental Permit" means any permit, license,

tests, and data in the possession or control of the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the existence of  Hazardous Materials at facilities
or properties currently or formerly  owned, operated, leased or used by the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or in any way concerning compliance by
the Company and  any of its Subsidiaries with, or liability of any of them,
under, any  Environmental Law.   (n) TAKEOVER STATUTES. The Board of
Directors of the Company has taken all  appropriate and necessary actions
such that Parent and the Merger Sub  will not be prohibited from entering
into a "business combination"  with the Company as an "interested
stockholder" (in each case as such  term is used in Section 48-103-205 of the
Tennessee Business  Combination Act) as a result of the execution and
delivery of this  Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.  No other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," or  other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation as in
effect on the  date hereof is applicable to the Company, the Company Shares,
the  Merger, or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No 
takeover statute or similar Law and no provision of the Charter or  bylaws,
or other organizational documents or governing instruments of  the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any material agreement to  which any of them is a
party (a) would or would purport to impose  restrictions which might
adversely affect or delay the consummation of  the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (b) as a result of  the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  or the acquisition of
securities of the Company or the Surviving  Corporation by Parent or Merger
Sub (i) would or would purport to  restrict or impair the ability of Parent
to vote or otherwise exercise  the rights of a Stockholder with respect to
securities of the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries that may be acquired or
controlled by  Parent or (ii) would or would purport to entitle any Person to
acquire  securities of the Company or the Parent (except for the Parent
Shares  issued as Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2
hereof).   (o) TAX MATTERS. With respect to Taxes except as set forth in
Section 3(o)  of the Company Disclosure Schedule:   (i) To the best
Knowledge of the Company, the Company has filed,  within the time and in the
manner prescribed by Law, all returns,  declarations, reports, estimates,
information returns, and   23   statements (the "Returns") required to be
filed under applicable  Law, and all such Returns are true, correct, and
complete. The  Company has within the time and in the manner prescribed by
Law,  paid all Taxes that are due and payable with respect to it and  its
consolidated group. The Company has established on the  balance sheet dated
as of the Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End  reserves, charges, and accruals
that are adequate for the payment  of all Taxes not yet due and payable that
are attributable to  periods ending on such date. There are no Liens for
Taxes upon  the assets of the Company except for Liens for Taxes not yet 
delinquent.   (ii) To the best Knowledge of the Company, no action, suit, 
proceeding, investigation, claim or audit has formally commenced  and no
written notice has been given that such audit or other  proceeding is pending
or threatened with respect to the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries or any
group of corporations of which  any of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
been a member in  respect of any Taxes, and all deficiencies proposed as a
result  of such actions, suits, proceedings, investigations, claims or 
audits have been paid, reserved against or settled. There are no  outstanding
waivers or comparable consents regarding the  application of the statute of
limitations with respect to any Tax  or Return that have been requested or
given by or that relate to  the Company.   (iii) The Company and, if
applicable, its agents and contracted  service providers, have complied in
all respects with all  applicable Laws relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes  and have, within the time and in the manner prescribed
by  applicable Law, withheld, collected, and paid over to the proper 
Authority all amounts required to be so withheld, collected, and  paid over
under all applicable Laws.   (iv) The Company and its Subsidiaries have not
made any payments, are  not obligated to make any payments, and are not a
party to any  agreements that under any circumstances could obligate any of 
them to make any payments, that will not be deductible under  Section 280G of
the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has made an
election under Section 341(f) of the  Code. None of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will be required  to include any material amount in taxable
income for any taxable  period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing
Date as a  result of a change in the method of accounting for a taxable 
period ending prior to the Closing Date, any "closing agreement"  as
described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding  provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Laws) entered into prior  to the Closing Date,
any sale reported on the installment method  that occurred prior to the
Closing Date, or any taxable income  attributable to any amount that is
economically accrued prior to  the Closing Date.   24   (p) INSURANCE;
BONDS. Section 3(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule  contains a list of,
and the Parent has been furnished true and  complete copies of, all material
insurance policies and fidelity bonds  covering the Company\'s assets,
business, properties, operations,  employees, officers, and directors, and
other matters for which the  Company carries insurance. Section 3(p) of the
Company Disclosure  Schedule describes any self-insurance arrangement by or
affecting the  Company, including any reserves established thereunder,
covering any  years in which there are outstanding claims (the earliest of
such  years referred to as the "Company Base Year"). Except as set forth in 
Section 3(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no claim by  any
insured pending under any of such policies or bonds as to which  coverage has
been questioned, denied, or disputed by the underwriters  of such policies or
bonds. All premiums payable under all such  policies and bonds have been
paid, and the Company is otherwise in  full compliance with the terms and
conditions of all such policies and  bonds. As to all claims that might be
covered by such policies or  bonds, the Company has promptly and within any
prescribed time period  notified the insuring or bonding party in the proper
manner. Except  for claims listed on Section 3(p) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule,  there have been no notices given to the insurer of any claims that
may  be insured by insurer. Such policies of insurance and bonds (or other 
policies and bonds providing substantially similar insurance coverage)  have
been in effect continuously since the beginning of the Company  Base Year,
and remain in full force and effect. Such policies of  insurance and bonds
are of the type and in amounts customarily carried  by Persons conducting
similar businesses and do not exclude coverage  for punitive damages. Except
as set forth in Section 3(p) of the  Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no
threatened termination of, or  premium increase with respect to, any of such
policies or bonds.   (q) COMPLIANCE. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are in compliance  with, and are not in default or violation of,
(i) its Charter and  bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents of
such Subsidiary,  (ii) any Law or Order by which any of their respective
assets or  properties are bound or affected, and (iii) the terms of all
notes,  bonds, mortgages, indentures, contracts, permits, franchises and
other  instruments or obligations to which any of them is a party or by
which  any of them or any of their respective assets or properties is bound 
or affected, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any  such
failures of compliance, defaults and violations which could not, 
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a  Company
Materially Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries  are in
compliance with the terms of all approvals of Authorities,  except where the
failure to so comply could not, individually or in  the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Materially  Adverse Effect. Except as set forth
in Section 3(q) of the Company  Disclosure Schedule or as could not,
individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a Company
Materially Adverse Effect,  neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received notice of  any revocation or modification of any license,
permit, consent, or  approval of any Authority that is material to the
Company or any of  its Subsidiaries.   25   (r) ABSENCE OF LITIGATION.
Except as described in Section 3(r) of the  Company Disclosure Schedule or
expressly described in the Company  Public Reports filed and publicly
available prior to the date hereof,  there is no Litigation pending on behalf
of or against or, to the  Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company, any of its  Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties or
rights, before  or subject to any court or governmental Authority which
could,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a 
Company Materially Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its 
Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding Litigation or Order which, 
individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be  expected to
have a Company Materially Adverse Effect.   (s) TITLE TO ASSETS. Except as
described in Section 3(s) of the Company  Disclosure Schedule, the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries has good  and marketable title to all of their
real or personal properties  (whether owned or leased) and assets, free and
clear of all Liens  other than Liens which are reflected on the Company\'s
consolidated  balance sheet filed in its Form 10-Q for the Most Recent
Fiscal  Quarter End.   (t) POOLING; TAX MATTERS.   (i) The Company
intends that the Merger be accounted for under the  "pooling of interests"
method under the requirements of Opinion  No. 16 (Business Combinations) of
the Accounting Principles Board  of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, the  Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the
regulations of the  SEC.   (ii) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company nor any of  its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any
action, failed to  take any action or is aware of any fact or circumstance
that  would prevent (i) the Merger from being treated for financial 
accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests" in accordance  with GAAP and
the regulations of the SEC; provided, that the sale  of Company Shares
described in Section 5(i) are taken; or (ii)  the Merger from constituting a
reorganization within the meaning  of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (iii)
Assuming the issuance of Company Shares described in Section  5(i), the
Company has no Knowledge of any reason why it may not  receive a letter from
its independent accountants dated as of the  Closing Date and addressed to
the Company in which such  accountants will concur with the Company\'s
management\'s  conclusion that no conditions exist related to the Company
that  would preclude Parent from accounting for the Merger as a  "pooling of
interests."   26   (iv) Section 3(t) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
contains a true  and complete list of all Persons who, to the Knowledge of
the  Company, may be deemed to be Affiliates of the Company, excluding  all
of its Subsidiaries but including all directors and executive  officers of
the Company.   (u) OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Company has no
knowledge of any  reason why it may not receive the written opinion of
Merrill Lynch and  Co. to the effect that, in its opinion, as of the date
hereof, the  Merger Consideration is fair to the holders of the Company
Shares from  a financial point of view. The aggregate fees and expenses paid
or to  be paid to Merrill Lynch and Co. shall not exceed $500,000.   (v)
MATERIAL AGREEMENTS. Except as described on Section 3(v) of the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no agreements of the Company or  its
Subsidiaries (i) containing an unexpired covenant not to compete  or similar
restriction applying to the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries; (ii)
providing for interest rate, currency, or commodity  hedging, swap or similar
derivative transactions to which the Company  or its Subsidiaries is a party;
(iii) providing for payment based on  revenues, sales or profits; (iv)
between the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
Affiliate of the Company, on  the other hand; (v) which, if terminated by the
Company upon not more  than 30 days\' notice would result in liability to the
Company of more  than $1 million; or (vi) that would be required to be filed
and have  not been filed as an exhibit to a Form 10-K filed by the Company
with  the SEC as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "Company 
Material Agreements"). Assuming each Company Material Agreement  constitutes
a valid and binding obligation of each other Party  thereto, each Company
Material Agreement is a valid and binding  obligation of the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary, as the case  may be. To the Company\'s Knowledge, each
Company Material Agreement is  a valid and binding obligation of each other
Party thereto, and each  such Company Material Agreement is in full force and
effect. To the  Knowledge of the Company, there are no existing defaults
(or  circumstances or events that, with the giving of notice or lapse of 
time or both would become defaults) of the Company, any Subsidiary, or  any
third party under any of the Company Material Agreements.   (w) INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY.   (i) Except as would not, individually and in the aggregate, have
a  Company Materially Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and each of  its
Subsidiaries owns, has the right to acquire or is licensed or  otherwise has
the right to use (in each case, clear of any Liens  of any kind), all
Intellectual Property used in or necessary for  the conduct of its business
as currently conducted, (ii) no  claims are pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company,   27   threatened that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is  infringing on or otherwise violating the rights of any Person  with
regard to any Intellectual Property and (iii) to the  Knowledge of the
Company, no Person is infringing on or otherwise  violating any right of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  with respect to any Intellectual Property
owned by and/or  licensed to the Company or its Subsidiaries.   (ii)
Section 3(w) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of  the date
hereof, a true and complete list of all Intellectual  Property of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries, the loss or  impairment of which would cause a
Company Materially Adverse  Effect.   (iii) For purposes of this Agreement,
"Intellectual Property" shall  mean patents, copyrights, trademarks
(registered or  unregistered), service marks, brand names, trade dress,
trade  names, computer software programs and applications (including 
imbedded software), the goodwill associated with the foregoing  and
registrations in any jurisdiction of, and applications in any  jurisdiction
to register, the foregoing; and trade secrets and  rights in any jurisdiction
to limit the use or disclosure thereof  by any person.  4. REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT AND THE MERGER SUB. Except as  set forth in the
disclosure schedule prepared by the Parent and attached as  Exhibit I (the
"Parent Disclosure Schedule"), which is arranged to  correspond to the
numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in the  applicable sections of
this Agreement, each of the Parent and the Merger  Sub represents and
warrants to the Company as follows:   (a) ORGANIZATION, QUALIFICATION, AND
CORPORATE POWER. Each of Parent and  Merger Sub is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing, and in  good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation.  Section 4(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth, as of the  date hereof, a true and complete list of all
of the Parent\'s directly  and indirectly owned Subsidiaries, together with
the jurisdiction of  incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary and the
percentage of  each Subsidiary\'s outstanding capital stock or other equity
or other  interest owned by the Parent or another Subsidiary of the Parent. 
Except as set forth in Section 4(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, 
neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any equity or  similar
interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable  or exercisable
for, directly or indirectly, any equity or similar  interest in, any Person.
Each of the Parent and its Subsidiaries is  duly authorized to conduct
business and is in good standing under the  laws of each jurisdiction where
such qualification is required, except  where the lack of such qualification
would not have a materially  adverse effect on the business, financial
condition, operations,  results of operations, or future prospects of the
Parent and its  Subsidiaries taken as a whole (a "Parent Materially Adverse
Effect").  Each of the Parent and all of its Subsidiaries has full
corporate  power and authority to carry on the businesses in which it is
engaged  and to own and use the properties owned and used by it. The Parent
has   28   heretofore furnished to the Company a true and complete copy of
each  of its and each of its Subsidiaries\' Charter and bylaws or
equivalent  organizational documents, as amended or restated to the date
hereof.  Such Charter and bylaws and equivalent organizational documents of
the  Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, and 
no other organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon  the
Parent or its Subsidiaries.   (b) CAPITALIZATION.   (i) The entire
authorized capital stock of the Parent consists of  150,000,000 Parent Shares

(iv) 5,341,652 Parent Shares were duly reserved for future  issuance pursuant
to employee and director stock options granted  pursuant to the Parent\'s
three stock option plans (the "Parent  Stock Option Plans"), of which
5,001,102 represented Parent  Shares reserved for options that had been
granted prior to the  date hereof (the "Outstanding Parent Stock
Options").   (ii) None of the outstanding Parent Shares are subject to, nor
were  they issued in violation of any, purchase option, call option,  right
of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or  any similar right.
Except as set forth above and in Section 4(b)  of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, no shares of voting or  non-voting capital stock, other equity
interests, or other voting  securities of the Parent were issued, reserved
for issuance or  outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital stock of
the  Parent are, and all shares which may be issued upon the exercise  of
stock options and similar purchase rights will be, when  issued, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and  nonassessable and not subject to
any kind of preemptive (or  similar) rights. There are no bonds, debentures,
notes or other  indebtedness of the Parent with voting rights (or
convertible  into, or exchangeable for, securities with voting rights) on
any  matters on which stockholders of the Parent may vote.   (iii) All of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the  Parent\'s
Subsidiaries have been duly authorized, validly issued,  fully paid and
nonassessable, are not subject to, and were not  issued in violation of, any
preemptive (or similar) rights, and  are owned, of record and beneficially,
by the Parent or one of  its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, free and clear
of all Liens  whatsoever. Except as set forth in Section 4(b) of the Parent 
Disclosure Schedule, there are no restrictions of any kind which  prevent the
payment of dividends by any of the Parent \'s  Subsidiaries, and neither the
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries  is subject to any obligation or
requirement to provide funds for  or to make any investment (in the form of a
loan or capital  contribution) to or in any Person.   29   (iv) Except as
described in Section 4(b) of the Parent Disclosure  Schedule, there are no
outstanding securities, options, warrants,  calls, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities,  commitments, agreements, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind  (contingent or otherwise) to which the Parent or
any of its  Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound 
obligating the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,  deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued, delivered or sold,  additional shares of capital stock
or other voting securities of  the Parent or of any of its Subsidiaries or
obligating the Parent  or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or
enter into  any such security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment, 
agreement, arrangement or undertaking. There are no outstanding  contractual
obligations of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries  to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any shares of capital  stock (or options or warrants to
acquire any such shares) of the  Parent or its Subsidiaries. Except as
described in Section 4(b)  of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date
hereof, there  are no stock-appreciation rights, stock-based performance
units,  "phantom" stock rights or other agreements, arrangements or 
commitments of any character (contingent or otherwise) pursuant  to which any
Person is or may be entitled to receive any payment  or other value based on
the revenues, earnings or financial  performance, stock price performance or
other attribute of the  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or assets or
calculated in  accordance therewith (other than ordinary course payments or 
commissions to sales representatives of the Parent based upon  revenues
generated by them without augmentation as a result of  the transactions
contemplated hereby) or to cause the Parent or  any of its Subsidiaries to
file a registration statement under  the Securities Act, or which otherwise
relate to the registration  of any securities of the Parent. Except as set
forth in Section  4(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no
voting  trusts, proxies or other agreements, commitments or  understandings
of any character to which the Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of the Parent, any of the  Parent \'s stockholders is a party or by
which any of them is  bound with respect to the issuance, holding,
acquisition, voting  or disposition of any shares of capital stock of the
Parent or  any of its Subsidiaries.   (c) AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSACTION.
Each of the Parent and the Merger Sub  has full power and authority
(including full corporate power and  authority) to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform its  obligations hereunder; provided, however, that
the Parent cannot  consummate the Merger unless and until it receives the
Requisite  Stockholder Approval. This Agreement constitutes the valid and
legally  binding obligation of each of the Parent and the Merger Sub, 
enforceable in accordance with its terms and conditions.   30   (d)
NONCONTRAVENTION. Neither the execution and delivery of this  Agreement, nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated  hereby, will (i) violate
any Law or other restriction of any Authority  to which either the Parent or
the Merger Sub is subject or any  provision of the Charter or bylaws of
either the Parent or the Merger  Sub or (ii) conflict with, result in a
breach of, constitute a default  under, result in the acceleration of, create
in any Party the right to  accelerate, terminate, modify, or cancel, or
require any notice or  consent under any agreement, contract, lease, license,
instrument, or  other arrangement to which either the Parent or the Merger
Sub is a  party or by which either is bound or to which any of their assets
is  subject (or result in the imposition of any Lien upon any of its 
assets), except in each case as set forth in Section 4(d) of the  Parent
Disclosure Schedule or as would not reasonably be expected,  individually or
in the aggregate, to have a Parent Materially Adverse  Effect (including by
reason of any cross-default). Other than in  connection with the provisions
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the  Tennessee Business Corporation Act, the
Tennessee Business Combination  Act, the Nevada General Corporation Law, the
Securities Exchange Act,  the Securities Act, state securities laws, and the
rules and  regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market, neither the Parent nor any
of  its Subsidiaries needs to give any notice to, make any filing with, or 
obtain any authorization, consent, or approval of any Authority in  order for
the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by  this
Agreement.   (e) PARENT PUBLIC REPORTS. The Parent has filed all forms,
reports,  schedules, statements, and documents required to be filed by it
with  the SEC since January 1, 1998 (collectively, the "Parent Public 
Reports"). Each of the Parent Public Reports has complied with the 
Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in all material  respects.
None of the Parent Public Reports, as of their respective  dates (or if
amended or superseded, at the time of such subsequent  filing), contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted  to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements  made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were  made, not misleading. The Parent has
delivered to the Company a  correct and complete copy of each Parent Public
Report (together with  all exhibits and schedules thereto and as amended to
date).   (f) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Each of the audited and unaudited

applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered  thereby; and

that the interim statements are subject to  normal and recurring year-end
adjustments that have not been and to  the Parent\'s Knowledge will not be
material.   31   (g) EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO MOST RECENT FISCAL QUARTER END.
Since the Most  Recent Fiscal Quarter End, there has not been any event,
circumstance,  act, or omission that has resulted in, or reasonably would be
expected  to result in, a Parent Materially Adverse Effect.   (h)
UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Neither the Parent nor any of its  Subsidiaries has
liabilities or obligations of any nature, (whether  known or unknown, whether
asserted or unasserted, whether absolute or  contingent, whether accrued or
unaccrued, whether liquidated or  unliquidated, and whether due or to become
due), including any  liability for Taxes, which individually or in the
aggregate would  reasonably be expected to have a Parent Materially Adverse
Effect,  except for (i) liabilities set forth on the face of the balance
sheet  dated as of the Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End (rather than in any 
notes thereto) and filed in the Parent Public Reports; (ii)  liabilities or
obligations which have arisen after the Most Recent  Fiscal Quarter End in
the Ordinary Course of Business (none of which  results from, arises out of,
relates to, is in the nature of, or was  caused by any breach of contract,
breach of warranty, tort,  infringement, or violation of Law); and (iii)
liabilities or  obligations set forth in Section 4(h) of the Parent
Disclosure  Schedule.   (i) BROKERS\' FEES. Neither the Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any  liability or obligation to pay any fees or
commissions to any broker,  finder, or agent with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement for which the Company could become liable or
obligated.   (j) DISCLOSURE. None of the information supplied by the Parent
for  inclusion in the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement 
thereto, shall, at the time such document is filed, at the time  amended or
supplemented and at the time the Registration Statement is  declared
effective by the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a  material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light  of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. None  of the information supplied by
the Parent for inclusion in the  Definitive Proxy Materials shall, on the
date such materials are first  mailed to the stockholders of the Company and
Parent, at the time of  the Special Meetings, and at the Effective Time,
contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact  required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the  statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are 
made, not false or misleading or omit to state any material fact  necessary
to correct any statement in any earlier communication with  respect to the
Special Meetings which has become false or misleading.  If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any event relating to the  Parent or any of its
respective Affiliates, officers or directors   32   should be discovered
by the Parent which should be set forth in an  amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or an amendment  or supplement to the Definitive Proxy
Materials, the Parent shall  promptly inform Company and Merger Sub. The
Definitive Proxy Materials  shall comply in all material respects as to form
and substance with  the requirements of the Exchange Act and the regulations
promulgated  thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent makes no 
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by 
Parent or Merger Sub which is contained in the Registration Statement  or
Definitive Proxy Materials.   (k) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.   (i) Section

meaning of Section 401(a) of  the Code, the IRS has issued a favorable
determination letter,  and to the Knowledge of the Parent nothing has
occurred at the  date hereof that reasonably would be expected to cause the

funding deficiency within the  meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412

recent five plan years.   (vii) There are no pending actions, claims or
lawsuits which have been  asserted, instituted or, to the Knowledge of the

Closing Date, or any taxable income  attributable to any amount that is
economically accrued prior to  the Closing Date.   (p) INSURANCE; BONDS.

Disclosure Schedule,  there have been no notices given to the insurer of any
claims that may  be insured by insurer. Such policies of insurance and bonds
(or other  policies and bonds providing substantially similar insurance
coverage)  have been in effect continuously since the beginning of the
Parent  Base Year, and remain in full force and effect. Such policies of 
insurance and bonds are of the type and in amounts customarily carried  by
Persons conducting similar businesses and do not exclude coverage  for

Disclosure Schedule, there is no threatened termination of, or  premium
increase with respect to, any of such policies or bonds.   (q) COMPLIANCE.

properties is bound  or affected, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any  such failures of compliance, defaults and violations which
could not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a  Parent Materially Adverse Effect. The Parent and its Subsidiaries are  in
compliance with the terms of all approvals of Authorities, except  where the
failure to so comply could not, individually or in the  aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Materially Adverse  Effect. Except as set forth
in Section 4(q) of the Parent Disclosure  Schedule or as could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably  be expected to have a Parent
Materially Adverse Effect, neither the  Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries

the date hereof, there  is no Litigation pending on behalf of or against or,
to the Knowledge  of the Parent, threatened against the Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries,  or any of their respective properties or rights, before or
subject to  any court or governmental Authority which could, individually or
in  the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Materially 
Adverse Effect. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is  subject to
any outstanding Litigation or Order which, individually or  in the aggregate,
has had or could reasonably be expected to have a  Parent Materially Adverse
Effect.   (s) TITLE TO ASSETS. Except as described in Section 4(s) of the

sheet filed in its Form 10-Q for the Most Recent Fiscal  Quarter End.   (t)
POOLING; TAX MATTERS.   (i) The Parent intends that the Merger be accounted
for under the  "pooling of interests" method under the requirements of
Opinion  No. 16 (Business Combinations) of the Accounting Principles Board 
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the  Financial
Accounting Standards Board, and the Regulations of the  SEC.   (ii) To the
Knowledge of the Parent, neither the Parent nor any of its  Affiliates has
taken or agreed to take any action, failed to take  any action or is aware of
any fact or circumstance that would  prevent (i) the Merger from being
treated for financial  accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests" in
accordance  with GAAP and the regulations of the SEC; provided, that the
sale  of Parent Shares described in Section 5(i) are taken; or (ii) the 
Merger from constituting a reorganization within the meaning of  Section
368(a) of the Code.   (iii) Assuming the issuance of Parent Shares described
in Section  5(i), the Parent has no Knowledge of any reason why it may not 
receive a letter from its independent accountants dated as of the  Closing
Date and addressed to the Parent in which such  accountants will concur with
the Parent\'s management\'s conclusion  that no conditions exist related to
the Parent that would  preclude Parent from accounting for the Merger as a
"pooling of  interests."   (iv) Section 4(t) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule contains a true  and complete list of all Persons who, to the

Person is infringing on or otherwise   41   violating any right of the

4(u) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of  the date hereof, a
true and complete list of all Intellectual  Property of the Parent and each

Meeting") to  consider the Merger and the other matters to be approved as 
contemplated herein (the "Joint Proxy Statement"), and Parent  shall prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on  Form S-4 pursuant to which
the Parent Shares to be issued as a  result of the Merger will be registered
with the SEC (the  "Registration Statement"), in which the Joint Proxy
Statement  will be included as a prospectus. Parent and the Company shall 
use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to  become
effective as soon after such filing as practical. The   47   Joint Proxy
Statement shall include the recommendation of the  Board of Directors of the
Company in favor of this Agreement and  the Merger and the recommendation of
the Board of Directors of  Parent in favor of the issuance of Parent Shares
pursuant to the  Merger and the other matter required by this Agreement,
provided  that the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw such 
recommendation if such Board of Directors has received an  Acquisition
Proposal and as a result shall have determined in  good faith upon the
written advice of its outside legal counsel,  that the withdrawal of such
recommendation is necessary for the  Board of Directors to comply with its
fiduciary duties under  applicable law. Parent and Company shall make all
other necessary  filings with respect to the Merger under the Securities Act
and  the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.   (ii) The
Company shall take such action as may be necessary to insure  that (A) the
information to be supplied by the Company for  inclusion in the Registration
Statement shall not at the time the  Registration Statement is declared
effective by the SEC contain  any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any  material fact, required to be stated in the Registration 
Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in the  Registration
Statement, in light of the circumstances under which  they were made, not
misleading, and (B) the information supplied  by the Company for inclusion in
the Joint Proxy Statement shall  not, on the date the Joint Proxy Statement
is first mailed to  shareholders of the Company or Parent, at the time of the
Company  Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting, and at the 
Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time and in  light of
the circumstances under which it shall be made, is false  or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state  any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made  in the Joint Proxy Statement not false
or misleading, or omit to  state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any  earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies  for the Company Special Meeting or Parent Special Meeting which 
has become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the  Effective Time
any event relating to Parent or any of its  Affiliates, officers, or
directors should be discovered by the  Company which should be set forth in
as amendment to the  Registration Statement or a supplement to the Joint
Proxy  Statement, the Company shall promptly so inform Parent.   (iii)

necessary  in order to make the statements in the Registration Statement,
in  light of the circumstances under which they were made, not  misleading,
and (B) the information supplied by Parent for  inclusion in the Joint Proxy
Statement shall not on the date the   48   Joint Proxy Statement is first
mailed to shareholders of Parent  or the Company, at the time of the Parent
Special Meeting and the  Company Special Meeting, and at the Effective Time,
contain any  statement which, at such time and in light of the
circumstances  under which it shall be made, is false or misleading with
respect  to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact  necessary
in order to make the statements made in the Joint Proxy  Statement not false
or misleading, or omit to state any material  fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier  communication with respect to the solicitation of

has  become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective  Time
any event relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates,  officers, or
directors should be discovered by Parent which  should be set forth in an
amendment to the Registration Statement  or a supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement, Parent shall  promptly so inform the Company.   (e) SHAREHOLDERS
MEETING. Parent and the Company each shall call a meeting  of its respective
shareholders to be held as promptly as practicable  for the purpose of
voting, in the case of the Company, upon this  Agreement and the Merger and,
in the case of Parent, upon the issuance  of shares of Parent Shares pursuant
to the Merger and the other matter  required by this Agreement. Subject to
Section 5(d) and (h), the  Company and Parent will, through their respective
Boards of Directors,  recommend to their respective shareholders approval of
such matters  and will coordinate and cooperate with respect to the timing of
such  meetings and shall use their best efforts to hold such meetings on
the  same day and as soon as practicable after the date hereof. Subject to 
Section 5(d), each Party shall use all reasonable efforts to solicit  from
its shareholders proxies in favor of such matters.   (f) ADDITIONAL

mutually agreed by the other  Party) the applicable Special Meeting without
the consent of the other  Party unless this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to Section 7.   (g) ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Upon reasonable notice,
each of the Company and  the Parent shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford  to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other  representatives and agents of the other Party (collectively 
"Representatives"), reasonable access, during the period prior to the 
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments  and
records and, during such period, each of the Company and the  Parent shall
(and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish  promptly to the other
all information concerning its business,  properties, books, contracts,
commitments, record and personnel as the  other Party may reasonably request.
Each of the Company and the Parent   49   shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) make available to  the other Party the appropriate
individuals for discussion of such  entity\'s business, properties and
personnel as the other Party or its  Representatives may reasonably request.

representations or warranties of  the parties herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties  hereto.   (h) OTHER OFFERS.   (i) The Company
shall not, whether directly or indirectly through  advisors, agents, or other
intermediaries, nor shall the Company  authorize or permit any of its

proposal  or offer for a merger, consolidation, recapitalization, 
liquidation, dissolution, business combination, sale of  substantial assets,
sale of shares of capital stock (including  without limitation by way of a
tender offer or exchange offer),  or similar transaction involving the
Company, other than the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any
other  transaction the consummation of which could reasonably be  expected
to impede, interfere with, prevent, or materially delay  the Merger or which
could reasonably be expected to materially  dilute the benefits to Parent of
the transactions contemplated  hereby (each such transaction, inquiries, or
proposals being  referred to in this Agreement as an "Acquisition Proposal"),
(B)  engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any  non-
public information to any person or entity relating to, any  Acquisition
Proposal, or (C) agree to, approve, or recommend any  Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that nothing contained  in this Agreement shall prevent
the Company or its Board of  Directors from furnishing non-public information
to, or entering  into discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity,
or  taking any other action deemed necessary, in connection with an 
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such person  or entity
or recommending an unsolicited bona fide written  Acquisition Proposal to the
shareholders, if and only to the  extent that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith upon  the written advice of outside legal counsel
that such action is  necessary for it to comply with its fiduciary duties
to  shareholders under applicable law (a "Fiduciary Finding");   (ii) The
Company shall notify Parent promptly (and no later than 24  hours) after
receipt by the Company (or its advisors), of any  Acquisition Proposal or any
request for non-public information in  connection with an Acquisition
Proposal or for access to the  properties, books, or records of the Company
by any person or  entity that informs the Company that it is considering
making, or  has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall
be  made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable  detail the
identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions  of such proposal,
inquiry, or contact, including, specifically, a  copy of any written
Acquisition Proposal;   50   (iii) The Board of Directors of the Company
shall not take any of the  actions referred to in clause (C) first sentence
of Section  5(h)(i) until after giving at least five (5) days\' written

providing Parent all of the information called for in this  Section 5(h).
During the five-day notice period the Parent shall  have the opportunity to
amend its offer to match or exceed the  Acquisition Proposal. If in the
opinion of the Company\'s Board of  Directors the consideration offered by
Parent represents  substantially equivalent or greater value than the
Acquisition  Proposal, then this Agreement shall be amended to reflect such 
revised consideration offered by Parent and in such event, this  Agreement
shall continue in force, as so amended;   (iv) The Company shall immediately
cease and cause its advisors,  agents, and other intermediaries to cease any
and all existing  activities, discussions, or negotiations with any Parties 
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;   (v) If a
Payment Event occurs, the Company shall pay to Parent,  within one business
day following such event, a fee of  $10,000,000 by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. Such  fee obligation shall be in addition to any
payment obligation of  the termination pursuant to Section 7(c). "Payment
Event" means  this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to any of the 
following events:   (A) the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant

Transaction within twelve (12) months of the  termination of this
Agreement;   (B) the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to 
Section 7(a)(viii) after a willful breach by the Company of this  Agreement;
or   (C) the termination of this Agreement by Parent or the Company 
pursuant to Section 7(a)(vi) as a result of the failure to  receive the
Requisite Shareholder Approval of this Agreement and  the Merger by the
shareholders of the Company at a duly held  meeting of the Company\'s
Stockholders or any adjournment thereof  if, (I) at the time of such failure,
there shall have been  announced an Alternative Transaction (as defined
below) which  shall not have been absolutely and unconditionally withdrawn
and  abandoned and (II) the Company shall have signed a definitive 
agreement for such Alternative Transaction within twelve (12)  months of such
failure.   51   (vi) As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction"
means a  merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation,  dissolution,
business combination, sale of substantial assets,  sale of shares of capital
stock (including without limitation by  way of a tender offer or exchange
offer), or similar transaction  involving the Company in which (A) any person
(or group of  persons) other than Parent or its Affiliates (a "Third
Party")  acquires more than 30% of the outstanding Company Shares or  equity
interests of the entity surviving such transaction, (B)  any other
transaction pursuant to which any Third Party acquires  control of assets of
the Company having a fair market value equal  to more than 30% of the fair
market value of all the assets of  the Company, and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, immediately  prior to such transaction, or (C) any public
announcement of a  proposal, plan, or intention to do any of the foregoing or
any  agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.   (vii) this Section 5(h)
shall survive any termination of this  Agreement, however caused.   (i)

be accounted for as a pooling of interests, including but not  limited to,
issuing approximately 300,000 Company Shares.   (ii) The Company shall not
knowingly take, or knowingly permit any  controlled Affiliate of the Company
to take, any action that  could prevent the Merger from being treated (A) for
financial  accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests" under GAAP; it 
being understood and agreed that if the Company\'s independent  accountants
advise the Company in writing that such an action  would not prevent the
Merger from being so treated, such action  will be conclusively deemed not to
constitute a breach of this  Section 5(i) or (B) as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of  Section 368 of the Code.   (iii) The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain an  executed affiliate pooling agreement
substantially in the form  attached hereto as Exhibit E from each of the
Persons identified  in Section 5(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule

other person who may be deemed an affiliate of the Company  regarding

Parent shall take or cause to be taken all reasonable acts  (without
breaching any obligation to any other Person) required  in order to permit

of interests, including but not  limited to, issuing approximately 2,000,000
Parent Shares  currently held in treasury.   (v) Parent shall not knowingly
take or knowingly permit any  controlled Affiliate of Parent to take, any
action that could  prevent the Merger from being treated (A) for financial 
accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests" under GAAP; it  being
understood and agreed that if Parent\'s independent  accountants advise
Parent in writing that such an action would  not prevent the Merger from
being so treated, such action will be  conclusively deemed not to constitute
a breach of this Section  5(i); or (B) as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section  368 of the Code.   (vi) Parent shall use its reasonable
efforts to obtain an executed  affiliate pooling agreement in substantially
the form of attached  Exhibit E from each of the Persons identified in
Section 5(i) of  the Parent Disclosure Schedule regarding compliance with
the  requirements for accounting treatment of the Merger as a "pooling  of
interests" (each such agreement a "Parent Affiliate Pooling  Agreement").

in the case of any representation or warranty qualified by  its terms by
materiality, Parent Materially Adverse Effect or  Company Materially Adverse
Effect, then untrue or inaccurate in  any respect) and any failure of the
Company, Parent or Merger  Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy

Merger and the transactions contemplated  hereby; (C) any Litigation,

under any  Company Material Agreement or Parent Material Agreement; and (E) 
any change that could reasonably be expected to have a Company  Materially
Adverse Effect or Parent Materially Adverse Effect or  is likely to delay or
impede the ability of either Parent or the  Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement or to fulfill their respective
obligations set forth  herein.   (iii) Each of the Company and Parent shall

efforts, and will take any such actions reasonably requested  by the other
Parties, to limit the adverse effect upon the  Company and Parent, their
respective Subsidiaries, and their  respective businesses resulting, or which
would result after the  Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such
consent.   (k) LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET. Parent shall use its

the shares of either  Party on any national securities exchange or national
automated  quotation system, in which case the Party proposing to issue
such  press release or make such public announcement shall use its 
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other Party  before
issuing any such press release or making any such public  announcement.

Outstanding Company Stock Option  immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by 1.7,  rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent
Shares, and  the per-share exercise price for the Parent Shares issuable
upon  exercise of such assumed Outstanding Company Stock Option will be 
equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price  per share of
Company Shares at which such Outstanding Company  Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective  Time by 1.7, and rounding the
resulting exercise price up to the  nearest whole cent; provided, however,
that in the case of any  option to which section 421 of the Code applies by
reason of its  qualification under section 422 of the Code ("incentive
stock  options"), the option price, the number of shares purchasable 
pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise  of such
option shall be determined in accordance with the method  set forth above
unless use of such method will not preserve the  status of such options as
incentive stock options, in which case  the manner of determination shall be
adjusted in a manner that  both complies with Section 424(a) of the Code and
results in the  smallest modification in the economic values that otherwise
would  be achieved by the holder pursuant to the method set forth above; 
and provided further, that notwithstanding any other provisions  of this
Section 5(q), if use of the above methods would  disqualify the Merger as a
"pooling of interests" for financial  accounting purposes, then such methods
will be adjusted to the  extent necessary to preserve such accounting
treatment.   (ii) Parent shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
Parent  Shares for delivery upon exercise of Outstanding Company Stock 
Options assumed by Parent under this Agreement. Parent shall file  as soon as
practicable after the Effective Date a registration  statement on Form S-8
under the Securities Act covering the  Parent Shares issuable upon the
exercise of the Outstanding  Company Stock Options assumed by Parent pursuant
to this Section,  and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause such
registration   56   statement to become effective as soon thereafter as
practicable  and to maintain such registration in effect until the exercise
or  expiration of such assumed Outstanding Company Stock Options.   (iii)
The vesting of each Outstanding Company Stock Option shall not  accelerate as
a result of, or in connection with, the  transactions contemplated hereby,
except to the extent required  by the existing terms of the Company Stock
Option Plans or the  option agreement pursuant to which it was granted. In
addition,  the Company shall ensure that no discretion is exercised by the 
Board of Directors or any committee thereof or any other body or  Person so
as to cause the vesting of any Outstanding Company  Stock Option or any other
warrant or right to acquire Company  Shares to accelerate.   (r) INSURANCE
AND INDEMNIFICATION.   (i) The Parent will not take any action to alter or
impair any  exculpatory or indemnification provisions now existing in the 
Charter or bylaws of the Company for the benefit of any  individual who is
serving or has served as a director or officer  of the Company or is or was
otherwise entitled to indemnification  thereunder at any time prior to the
Effective Time;   (ii) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
indemnify, defend  and hold harmless any person who is on the date hereof, or
has  been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior  to the
Effective Time, an officer, director, employee or agent  (the "Indemnified
Party") of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities,  costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees
and expenses),  judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement in
connection  with any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding
or  investigation (each, a "Claim") to the extent that any such Claim  is
based on or arises out of, (A) the fact that any person is or  was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any  of its
Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time or is  or was serving at
the request of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another  corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other  enterprise at any time prior to the Effective Time,
or (B) this  Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or 
thereby in each case to the extent that any such Claim pertains  to any
matter or fact arising, existing, or occurring prior to or  at the Effective
Time, regardless of whether such Claim is  asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time (the  matters described in clauses (A) and (B),
the "Pre-Merger  Matters"), to the fullest extent indemnified under the
Company\'s  Charter, bylaws or any indemnification agreements in effect as
of  the date hereof, or under the Tennessee Business Corporation Act, 
including in each case provisions relating to the advancement of  expenses
incurred in the defense of any action or suit.   57   (iii) Parent agrees
that all right to indemnification and all  limitations or exculpation of
liabilities existing in favor of  any Indemnified Party as provided in the
Company\'s Charter,  bylaws or the Tennessee Business Corporation Act as in
effect as  of the Effective Time shall continue in full force and effect 
with respect to Pre-Merger Matters, without any amendment  thereto, for a
period of six years from the Effective Time to the  extent such rights are
consistent with the Tennessee Business  Corporation Act, provided, that in
the event any Claim or Claims  with respect to any such Pre-Merger Matters
are asserted or made  within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification in  respect of any such Claim or Claims shall continue
until  disposition of any such Claim or Claims; provided, however, that  any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an  Indemnified
Party\'s conduct complies with the standards set forth  under the Tennessee
Business Corporation Act, the Company\'s  Charter or bylaws, as the case may
be, shall be made by  independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party and  reasonably acceptable to the Parent, retained at the Parent\'s 
expense, and provided further that nothing in this Section shall  impair any
rights or obligations of any present or former  directors or officers of the
Company.   (iv) Parent shall maintain in effect the Company\'s directors\'
and  officers\' liability insurance policy at the Effective Time ("DandO; 
Insurance") with respect to Pre-Merger Matters for a period of  not less than
six years after the Effective Time, provided, that  the Parent may substitute
therefor policies of substantially  similar coverage and amounts containing
terms no less  advantageous to such former directors or officers.   (v) The
provisions of this Section 5(o) are intended to be for the  benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Person entitled to  indemnification hereunder
and the heirs and representatives of  such Person.   (s) ADDITIONAL
AGREEMENTS. Each of the Parent and the Company shall use  its best efforts to
cause (i) the Voting Agreements to be executed and  delivered
