and the Spinco Assets have been duly  transferred to Spinco and Spinco has
assumed all of the Spinco Liabilities  in a manner satisfactory to the
Acquiror, acting reasonably; provided that  taking any such step does not
itself result in, and would not reasonably  be expected to result in, any
Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax  on or being suffered by, the
Target Optionholders or the Target  Shareholders; \- 48 -

        | (f)   |

Target shall deliver a written notice and election form  to all holders of
Target Options prior to the Effective Date advising such  holders that the

Target Option Plans), elect to: 

 
        | (i)   |  

surrender Target Options to Target for cancellation  pursuant to section

      | (ii)   |

closing of the Arrangement. 

 
        | (b)   |

 5.4  Covenants of Acquiror Regarding the Performance of
Obligations

 

Acquiror shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, perform all obligations
required to be performed by Acquiror or any of Acquirors subsidiaries under
this Agreement which for greater certainty includes all obligations required
to be performed by Acquiror or any of its subsidiaries under Schedule B to
the Target Disclosure Letter, co-operate with Target in connection therewith,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all
such further acts and things as may be necessary or desirable in order to
consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Acquiror shall and, where applicable shall cause its
subsidiaries to:

        | (a)   |  

apply for and use commercially reasonable efforts to  obtain all the Key
Regulatory Approvals (including payment of any filing  fees) and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any other required  approvals from
Governmental Entities relating to Acquiror or any of its  subsidiaries which
are typically applied for by an acquiror and, in doing so, keep Target
reasonably informed as to the status of the proceedings related to obtaining
the Key Regulatory Approvals, including providing Target with copies of all
related applications and notifications in draft form (except that where such
material is confidential, contains information relating to the valuation of
the transactions herein, or is subject to privilege or immunity, it will in
each case be provided (subject to applicable Laws) to Targets outside
counsel on an "external counsel" basis), in order for Target to provide its
reasonable comments thereon; and \- 49 -

         | (b)   |  

subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and  of the Plan of
Arrangement and applicable Laws and in compliance with  Section 2.7, pay the
aggregate Consideration to be paid pursuant to the  Arrangement at the time
provided herein. 

 5.5   Mutual Covenants

 

Each of the Parties covenants and agrees that, except as contemplated in this
Agreement, during the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the time that this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms:

        | (a)   |  

it shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use  commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy (or cause the satisfaction of)  the conditions precedent
to its obligations hereunder as set forth in  Article 6 to the extent the
same is within its control and to take, or  cause to be taken, all other
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all  other things necessary, proper
or advisable under all applicable Laws to  complete the Plan of Arrangement,
including using commercially reasonable  efforts to: (i) obtain all Key
Regulatory Approvals required to be  obtained by it; (ii) effect or make
promptly all necessary registrations,  filings and submissions of information
requested by Governmental Entities  required to be effected by it in
connection with the Plan of Arrangement;  (iii) oppose, lift or rescind any
injunction or restraining order against  it or other order or action against
it seeking to stop, or otherwise  adversely affecting its ability to make and
complete, the Plan of  Arrangement; and (iv) co-operate with the other Party
in connection with  the performance by it and its subsidiaries of their
obligations hereunder;  in addition, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, none  of the Parties shall knowingly take or cause to be
taken any action which  would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

it shall not take any action, refrain from taking any  commercially
reasonable action, or permit any action to be taken or not  taken, which is
inconsistent with this Agreement or which would reasonably  be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, materially delay or  materially impede the
making or completion of the Plan of Arrangement  except as permitted by this
Agreement; 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

Target shall effect such reorganization of its business,  operations,
subsidiaries and assets or such other transactions as Acquiror  may
reasonably request (each, a "Pre-Acquisition Reorganization")  prior to or
following the Effective Time, and the Plan of Arrangement, if required, shall
be modified accordingly; provided, however, that Target need not effect
a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization which in the opinion of Target,
acting reasonably: (i) would require Target to obtain the prior approval of
the shareholders of Target in respect of such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization
other than at the Target Meeting; or (ii) would impede or delay the
consummation of the Arrangement by more than 20 Business Days. Without
limiting the foregoing and other than as set forth in clause (ii) above,
Target shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from any Persons to effect each Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization, and Target shall cooperate with Acquiror in
structuring, planning and implementing any such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization. Target shall also cooperate with Acquiror to the extent
reasonable in the preparation and filing of any request for an advance income
tax ruling or private letter ruling. Acquiror shall provide written notice to
Target of any proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization at least 10 Business
Days prior to the Effective Date. In addition: \- 50 -

         | (i)   |  

Acquiror shall indemnify and save harmless Target and its  subsidiaries
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors  and
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,  damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest awards, judgments and penalties  suffered
or incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result of  any Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization or as a result of the reversal (where  such
reversal is determined by Target to be necessary, acting reasonably)  of all
or any of the Pre-Acquisition Reorganization steps in the event the 
Arrangement does not proceed (including actual out-of-pocket costs and 
expenses for filing fees and external counsel); 

 
        | (ii)   |  

unless the Parties otherwise agree, any Pre-Acquisition  Reorganization to be
effected prior to the Effective Time shall not become  effective unless
Acquiror shall have confirmed in writing the satisfaction  or waiver of all
conditions in its favour in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2  and shall have
confirmed in writing that it is prepared to promptly  without condition
(other than the satisfaction of the condition  contemplated by Section 6.2(a)
as it relates to the Pre-Acquisition  Reorganization) proceed to effect the
Arrangement; 

      |   | 
      | (iii)   |  

any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall not require  Target or any
subsidiary to contravene any applicable Laws, their  respective
organizational documents or any Contract; 

      |   | 
      | (iv)   |  

Target and its subsidiaries shall not be obligated to  take any action that
has a material likelihood of resulting in any  material adverse Tax or other
consequences to any securityholder of Target  or to Spinco or any subsidiary
of Spinco; and 

      |   | 
      | (v)   |  

such cooperation does not require the directors, officers  or employees of
Target to take any action in any capacity other than as a  director, officer
or employee, as applicable. \- 51 -

        | (d)   |  

Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that the planning for  and implementation of
any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization requested by  Acquiror shall not be
considered a breach of any covenant under this  Agreement and shall not be
considered in determining whether a  representation or warranty of Target
hereunder has been breached. Acquiror  and Target shall work cooperatively
and use reasonable commercial efforts  to prepare prior to the Effective Time
all documentation necessary and do  such other acts and things as are
necessary to give effect to such  Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. For greater
certainty and without limiting  the indemnity contained in Section 8.1,
Target shall not be liable for any  Taxes arising as a result of, or the
failure of Acquiror to benefit from  any anticipated tax efficiency as a
result of, a Pre-Acquisition  Reorganization. 

      |   | 
      | (e)   |  

For the avoidance of doubt, Target shall not be required  pursuant to Section
8.1 to indemnify Acquiror for any Taxes which arise as  a result of a Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization. 

 5.6   Employment Arrangements

        | (a)   |  

Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that immediately prior  to the Effective
Time: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

Target shall terminate the employment of the Designated  Target Employees
with such termination being conditional on the occurrence  of the Effective
Time; 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

in connection with the termination referred to in Section  5.6(a)(i) above,
Target shall make all payments in a lump sum (less  applicable statutory
deductions) in respect of the Change of Control  Payments set out in Section
3.1(y) of the Target Disclosure Letter.  Acquiror and Target acknowledge and
agree that completion of the  Arrangement will be treated as triggering the
Change of Control Payments;  and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (iii)   |  

if the Effective Date occurs other than at the end of a  regular pay period
of the Target, Target shall pay to all Designated  Target Employees all
salary, bonus, vacation pay or other payments payable  to them in the
ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with  past practice and
their respective employment agreements, service  contracts, and in accordance
with applicable Laws or otherwise that have  accrued in respect of that pay
period and which remain unpaid on the day  prior to the Effective Date. 

      |   |   |     |   | (b)   |  

Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that immediately prior  to the Effective
Time: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

Target shall terminate the employment of any employees of  Target and its
subsidiaries that are not Designated Target Employees or  Retained Employees
with such termination being conditional on closing of  the Arrangement and
taking effect at the Effective Time; and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

in connection with the termination referred to in Section  5.6(b)(i) above,
Target shall pay in a lump sum (less any applicable  statutory deductions) a
severance payment to each such employee in an amount that is equal to the
greater of (A) one months salary for each year of service (pro rated to
actual length of service), and (B) such employees entitlements under
applicable Law (as determined by Fronteers counsel, acting reasonably and in
consultation with Acquirors external counsel) or contract; and \- 52 -

         | (iii)   |  

if the Effective Date occurs other than at the end of a  regular pay period
of the Target, Target shall pay to each employee  referred to in Section
5.6(b)(i) all salary, bonus, vacation pay or other  payments payable to them
in the ordinary course of business in a manner  consistent with past practice
and, if applicable, their respective  employment agreements, service
contracts, and in accordance with  applicable Laws or otherwise that have
accrued in respect of that pay  period and which remain unpaid on the day
prior to the Effective  Date. 

 
        | (c)   |  

The Parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time,  Acquiror shall be
entitled to make an offer of employment to any employees  of Target and its
subsidiaries (including any employee that would, if such  employee accepted
Spincos offer of employment contemplated in Section  5.6(d), be a Spinco
Employee) on such terms as Acquiror, in its sole  discretion, determines are
appropriate. 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |  

Spinco covenants and agrees that it shall make offers of  employment to each
of the Spinco Employees (other than the Designated  Employees) on
substantially the same or improved terms as currently  enjoyed by such
employees having regard to, among other things, title,  responsibility,
salary, benefits, bonus, vacation entitlement and location  of employment. 

 

If the Effective Date occurs, Section 5.6(d) shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and be enforceable by the beneficiaries thereof.

 5.7  Adjustment to Consideration regarding Distributions

 

If on or after the date hereof, Target declares, sets aside or pays any
dividend or other distribution to the Target Shareholders of record as of a
time prior to the Effective Time (except for the distribution of
Spinco Shares pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement), the Board of Directors of
Acquiror and the Target Board shall make such adjustments to the
Consideration as they determine acting in good faith to be necessary to
restore the original intention of the Parties in the circumstances. For
greater certainty, if Target takes any of the actions referred to above, the
aggregate consideration to be paid by Acquiror shall be decreased by an
equivalent amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.7
shall restrict the ability of Acquiror to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.2(c)(ii) in the event the condition precedent to the obligations
of Acquiror set out in Section 6.2(b) shall not have been met.

 5.8   Spinco Ownership

        | (a)   |  

Acquiror covenants in favour of Spinco that, from and  after the Effective
Time until the second anniversary of the Effective  Date, it and its
affiliates will not, without the express advance written approval of the
board of directors of Spinco, acquire or propose to acquire or otherwise
obtain or propose to obtain a right to acquire or to control any securities
of Spinco that would result in Acquiror and its affiliates having a Pro Rata
Interest in excess of 19.9%; provided that this Section 5.8(a) shall cease to
apply in the event that Spinco (a) publicly announces its intention to agree
to a merger, amalgamation, arrangement or direct or indirect sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of Spinco and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or any similar transaction, with or to a person other than Acquiror,
its affiliates or any person acting jointly or in concert with Acquiror or
its affiliates in respect of such transaction (a " **Third Party** ") which,
if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in Persons
who immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction were
shareholders of Spinco holding less than 50% of the voting securities of the
resulting or transferee corporation or entity, or (b) enters into an
agreement with a Third party pursuant to which Spinco agrees to support and
recommend a take-over bid by such Third Party (or an affiliate or agent of
such Third Party). \- 53 -

        | (b)   |  

If immediately following the Effective Time the Acquiror  and its affiliates
hold or are entitled to receive Spinco Shares and  Spinco Convertible
Securities that would result in Acquiror and its  affiliates having a Pro
Rata Interest in excess of 19.9%, it will, or will  cause its affiliate to: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

within 90 days of the date the Spinco Shares begin  trading on the TSX or TSX
Venture Exchange, as applicable (the  "Required Sale Date"), sell in an
orderly fashion such number of  Spinco Shares and/or Spinco Convertible
Securities (the "Excess  Securities") as would, after giving effect to the
sale of such Excess  Securities, reduce Acquirors and its affiliates Pro
Rata Interest to an  amount that is not in excess of 19.9%, provided that
prior to making any  block sale trades, Acquiror shall provide notice to
Spinco that it or its  affiliate intends to make a block sale trade at a
specified price and if  within five (5) Business Days of receiving such
notice, Spinco identifies  a buyer that is willing to purchase all but not
less than all of such  block of Excess Securities at a price that is at least
equal to such  specified price, Acquiror shall, or shall cause its affiliate
to, sell  such Excess Securities to the buyer identified by Spinco within
such five  Business Day period or such later time frame as Acquiror and such
buyer  may agree; and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

if Acquiror and its affiliates have not sold the Excess  Securities by the
Required Sale Date, Acquiror shall be required to sell,  or shall be required
to cause its affiliate to sell such Excess Securities  into the market or
otherwise at the direction of Spinco at the lesser of  the fair market value
determined by the directors of Spinco under section  4(c) of the Plan of
Arrangement and the current trading price of the  Spinco Shares on the TSX or
TSX Venture Exchange, as  applicable. 

 

If the Effective Time occurs, this Section 5.8 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement. \- 54 -

 5.9   Right to Participate

        | (a)   |  

If at any time after the Effective Time and prior to the  second anniversary
of the Effective Time, Spinco proposes to issue or sell  Spinco Shares or
Spinco Convertible Securities ("Additional Spinco  Securities") other than
(i) under any stock option plan of Spinco,  (ii) on the exercise, exchange or
conversion of Spinco Convertible  Securities, or (iii) for property other
than money, Acquiror shall have  the right to subscribe for and purchase
(directly or through an affiliate)  Additional Spinco Securities, at the
price at which such Additional Spinco  Securities are offered for sale to
other purchasers, up to the lesser of  19.9% of the Additional Spinco
Securities and its Pro Rata Interest, in  each case, prior to giving effect
to the issuance or sale of such  Additional Spinco Securities (the "Maximum
Additional  Securities"). 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

If Spinco intends to authorize and/or issue Spinco Shares  or Spinco
Convertible Securities that give rise to Acquirors rights  pursuant to
Section 5.9(a), Spinco shall provide notice to Acquiror (the  "Rights
Notice") no less than five (5) Business Days before the  date on which Spinco
intends to issue Spinco Shares or Spinco Convertible  Securities giving rise
to Acquirors rights pursuant to Section  5.9(a). 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

The Rights Notice shall provide the same information to  Acquiror regarding
the particulars of the issuance or sale of the  Additional Securities as is
provided to other Persons proposing to  participate in the subscription for
Additional Spinco Securities. Acquiror  shall give notice (an "Acceptance
Notice") to Spinco no later than  4:00 p.m. (Mountain time) on the fifth
Business Day following the receipt  of any Rights Notice setting out the
number of Additional Securities, if  any, up to the Maximum Additional
Securities which Acquiror intends to  subscribe for and purchase. Following
receipt of an Acceptance Notice,  Acquiror shall be entitled to participate
in the subscription for  Additional Securities in the same manner as other
Persons subscribing for  Additional Securities and shall be entitled to
subscribe for the number of  Additional Securities specified in the
Acceptance Notice under such  subscription. 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |  

Spinco hereby agrees that neither it nor any of its  subsidiaries will adopt
a shareholder rights plan or similar plan or take  any other action that is
inconsistent with Acquirors rights under this  Section 5.9 to maintain a
19.9% interest in Spinco until the second  anniversary of the Effective Time. 

 

If the Effective Date occurs, this Section 5.9 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.

 5.10   Target Guarantee

 

Target hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due and punctual
performance by Spinco of each and every covenant and obligation of Spinco
arising under this Agreement and the Arrangement for the benefit of Acquiror
and to be performed prior to the Effective Time. Target hereby agrees that
Acquiror shall not have to proceed first against Spinco before exercising its
rights under or in respect of this guarantee against Target. \- 55 -

Target shall have received a  certificate of Acquiror, addressed to Target
and dated the Effective Date,  signed on behalf of Acquiror by a senior
executive officer of Acquiror (on  Acquirors behalf and without personal
liability), confirming the same as  at the Effective Time; and 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

Acquiror shall have fully satisfied its obligations under  Section 2.7. 

 6.4   Satisfaction of Conditions

 

The conditions precedent set out in Section 6.1, Section 6.2 and Section 6.3
shall be conclusively deemed to have been satisfied, waived or released at
the Effective Time.

 6.5   Notice and Cure Provisions

 

Each Party will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or failure
to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time of any event or state of
facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be likely to:

        | (a)   |  

cause any of the representations or warranties of such  Party contained
herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect  on the date hereof
or at the Effective Time; or 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any  covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such  Party hereunder prior to
the Effective Time. \- 58 -

 

Acquiror may not exercise its rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.2(b)(iii) and Target may not exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(iii) unless the Party intending to rely
thereon has delivered a written notice to the other Party specifying in
reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties
or other matters which the Party delivering such notice is asserting as the
basis for the non-fulfilment of the applicable condition or for
the applicable termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice
is delivered, provided that a Party is proceeding diligently to cure such
matter and such matter is capable of being cured, no Party may terminate this
Agreement until the expiration of a period of 10 Business Days from such
notice, and then only if such matter has not been cured by such date. If such
notice has been delivered prior to the making of the application for the
Final Order or the Target Meeting, such application and/or such filing shall
be postponed until the expiry of such period.

  ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

 7.1   Non-Solicitation

        | (a)   |  

On and after the date hereof until the date upon which  this Agreement is
terminated, and except as otherwise expressly provided  in this Section 7.1,
Target shall not, directly or indirectly, or through  any of its
Representatives, and shall cause its subsidiaries and their  Representatives
not to: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate (including by  way of furnishing
information or entering into any form of agreement,  arrangement or
understanding) any inquiries or proposals whatsoever which  would constitute
an Acquisition Proposal; 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

participate in any discussions or negotiations with any  Person (other than
Acquiror, any of its affiliates or its or their  Representatives) regarding

      |   | (iii)   |  

approve, accept, endorse or recommend, or propose  publicly to accept,
approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition  Proposal; 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (iv)   |  

accept or enter into or publicly propose to accept or  enter into, any
agreement, understanding or arrangement or other contract  in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal; or 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (v)   |  

make a Change in Recommendation, unless (A) it does not  relate to an
Acquisition Proposal and (B) in the opinion of the Target  Board, acting in
good faith and after receiving advice from its outside  financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, the Target Board is required  to make a Change in
Recommendation in order to comply with the fiduciary  duties of such
directors under applicable Law. 

      |   |   |     |   | (b)   |  

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.1, Target  shall, and shall
cause its subsidiaries and its and their Representatives  to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion
or negotiation with any Persons (other than Acquiror and its Representatives)
conducted heretofore by Target, its subsidiaries or its or their
Representatives with respect to any potential Acquisition Proposal and, in
connection therewith, Target will discontinue access to any of
its confidential information (and not establish or allow access to any of
its confidential information, or any data room, virtual or otherwise) and
shall as soon as possible request, to the extent that it is entitled to do so
(and exercise all rights it has to require) the return or destruction of
all confidential information (including all material including or
incorporating or otherwise reflecting any material confidential information)
regarding Target and its subsidiaries previously provided to any such Person
or any other Person. \- 59 -

 

 Target agrees that, except as permitted by Section 7.1(c), neither it nor
any of its subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision
of any existing confidentiality agreement relating to a potential Acquisition
Proposal or any standstill agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries
is a party (it being acknowledged and agreed that the automatic termination
of any standstill provisions of any such agreement as the result of the
entering into and announcement of this Agreement by Target, pursuant to the
express terms of any such agreement, shall not be a violation of this Section
7.1(c)) and Target undertakes to enforce all standstill, non-disclosure, non-
disturbance, non-solicitation and similar covenants that it or any of its
subsidiaries have entered into prior to the date hereof; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not prevent the Target Board from considering an
Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably likely to be a Superior Proposal and
accepting a Superior Proposal that might be made by any such third party if
the remaining provisions of this Agreement have been complied with.

        | (c)   |  

Notwithstanding Sections 7.1(a) and 7.1(b) and any other  provision of this
Agreement or of any other agreement between Acquiror and  Target, if at any
time following the date of this Agreement and prior to  obtaining the Target
Shareholder Approval of the Arrangement Resolution at  the Target Meeting,
Target receives a written Acquisition Proposal (that  was not solicited after
the date hereof in contravention of Section 7.1(a)  and provided that Target
is in compliance with Sections 7.1(b) and  7.1(a)), the Target Board may
(directly or through its advisors or  Representatives): 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

if it believes, acting in good faith, that the  Acquisition Proposal could
reasonably be a Superior Proposal, contact the  Person(s) making such
Acquisition Proposal and its advisors solely for the  purpose of clarifying
such Acquisition Proposal and any material terms  thereof and the conditions
thereto and likelihood of consummation so as to  determine whether such
proposal is, or is reasonably likely to be, a  Superior Proposal; and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

if, in the opinion of the Target Board, acting in good  faith and after
receiving advice from its outside financial advisors and  outside legal
counsel, the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or, if  consummated in
accordance with its terms (disregarding, for the purposes  of any such
determination, any term of such Acquisition Proposal that  provides for a due
diligence investigation), would be a Superior Proposal, then, and only in
such case, Target may: \- 60 -

         | (A)   |  

furnish information with respect to Target and its  subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal for a period  of not more than 21
days; and/or 

      |   | 
      | (B)   |  

participate in discussions or negotiations with, the  Person making such
Acquisition Proposal; and/or 

      |   | 
      | (C)   |  

waive any standstill provision or agreement that would  otherwise prohibit
such person from making an Acquisition  Proposal, 

 

provided that Target shall not, and shall not allow its Representatives to,
disclose any non-public information with respect to Target to such Person (i)
if such non-public information has not been previously provided to, or is not
concurrently provided to, Acquiror; (ii) without entering into a
confidentiality and standstill agreement (if one has not already been entered
into) which is customary in such situations and which is no less favourable
to Target and no more favourable to the counterparty than the confidentiality
and standstill provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; and
(iii) without providing a copy of such confidentiality agreement to Acquiror.

 7.2  Notification of Acquisition Proposals

        | (a)   |  

Target shall promptly notify Acquiror, at first orally  and then in writing
within 24 hours of receipt of any proposal, inquiry,  offer or request
received by Target or its Representatives after the date  hereof (i) relating
to an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition  Proposal or inquiry that
could reasonably lead to or be expected to lead  to an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) for discussions or negotiations in  respect of an Acquisition Proposal
or potential Acquisition Proposal; or  (iii) for non-public information
relating to Target or its subsidiaries,  access to properties, books and
records or a list of the Target  Shareholders. Such notice shall indicate the
identity of the Person making  such proposal, inquiry or request, include a
copy of the Acquisition  Proposal and include a copy of any other
documentation received by Target  or its Representatives and such other
details of the Acquisition Proposal  known to Target as Acquiror may
reasonably request. Target shall keep  Acquiror promptly and fully informed
of the status, including any change  to the material terms, of such proposal,
inquiry, offer or request and  shall respond promptly to all reasonable
inquiries by Acquiror with  respect thereto and shall provide copies of any
written documents or  correspondence provided to Target relating to such
Acquisition  Proposal. 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

Subject to Section 7.3(a), at any time following the date  of this Agreement
and prior to obtaining Target Shareholder Approval, if  Target receives an
Acquisition Proposal which the Target Board concludes  in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Target Board may,  subject to compliance
with the procedures set forth in Section 9.2 and Section 9.4, terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal. \- 61 -

  7.3  Responding to Acquisition Proposal and Superior Proposals

        | (a)   |  

Notwithstanding Section 7.1 and subject to compliance  with Targets
obligations in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, Target may enter  into a
definitive agreement (a "Proposed Agreement") with any third  party providing
for an Acquisition Proposal, if such Acquisition Proposal  is a Superior
Proposal; provided that Target may do so only after Target  has provided
Acquiror with written notice that the Target Board has  determined that it
has received a Superior Proposal (a "Superior  Proposal Notice"), which
identifies the party making the Superior  Proposal, specifies the cash amount
that the Target Board has ascribed to  any non- cash consideration being
offered in the Superior Proposal, and  provides Acquiror with a copy of any
Proposed Agreement, in each case not  less than five Business Days (the
"Response Period") prior to the  proposed execution of such Proposed
Agreement by Target. For purposes of  this Agreement, the Response Period
shall expire at 5:00 p.m. (Mountain  time) on the fifth Business Day
following the day on which the Superior  Proposal Notice and Proposed
Agreement was provided to Acquiror. 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

During the Response Period, Target acknowledges and  agrees that Acquiror
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to  offer to amend the terms of
the Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement  (including increasing or modifying
the consideration to be received by the  Former Target Shareholders) in order
to provide for terms at least  equivalent to those provided for in the
Superior Proposal. If Acquiror  does so, then the Target Board shall review
any such proposal by Acquiror  to determine (acting in good faith and in
accordance with its fiduciary  duties) whether the Acquisition Proposal to
which Acquiror is responding  would continue to be a Superior Proposal when
assessed against the amended  Agreement and Plan of Arrangement as proposed
by Acquiror. If the Target  Board determines that the Acquisition Proposal
would thereby cease to be a  Superior Proposal, it will cause Target to enter
into an amendment to this  Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement reflecting
the offer by Acquiror to  amend the terms of the Agreement and Plan of
Arrangement and will further  agree not to enter into the applicable Proposed
Agreement and not to  withdraw, modify or change any recommendation regarding
the Plan of  Arrangement save and except to reaffirm its recommendation of
the amended  Plan of Arrangement. 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

If (i) Acquiror does not offer to amend the terms of the  Agreement and Plan
of Arrangement within the Response Period or (ii) the  Target Board
determines acting in good faith and in the proper discharge  of its fiduciary
duties (after consultation with its financial advisor and  after receiving
advice from its outside legal counsel) that the  Acquisition Proposal would
nonetheless remain a Superior Proposal with  respect to Acquirors proposal
to amend the Agreement and Plan of  Arrangement, and therefore rejects
Acquirors offer to amend the Plan of  Arrangement and this Agreement, Target
shall be entitled to terminate this  Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(d)(i)
following the expiry of the  Response Period and enter into the
Proposed Agreement upon payment to Acquiror of the amount payable pursuant to
Section 9.4. \- 62 -

         | (d)   |  

Target acknowledges and agrees that each successive  modification of any
Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new  Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of the requirement of Section 7.3 to  initiate an additional five
Business Day Response Period. 

      |   | 
      | (e)   |  

Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Target Board  from responding
through a directors circular or otherwise as required by  applicable Laws to
an Acquisition Proposal that it determines is not a  Superior Proposal.
Acquiror and its advisors shall be given a reasonable  opportunity to review
and comment on the content of any directors  circular prior to its printing
and Target shall consider for inclusion all  reasonable comments made by
Acquiror and its advisors. 

 7.4  Access to Information; Confidentiality

 

From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, subject to compliance with applicable Law and
the terms of any existing Contracts, Target shall, and shall cause
its subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees,
independent auditors, accounting advisers and agents to, afford to Acquiror
and its Representatives (upon reasonable advance notice and, at the option of
Target, with a Target representative present), such reasonable access during
regular business hours as Acquiror may reasonably require at all reasonable
times, without disruption to the conduct of Target business, including for
the purpose of facilitating integration business planning, to their officers,
employees, agents, properties, books, records and Contracts of Target and its
subsidiaries, and shall furnish Acquiror with all data and information (other
than data and information relating solely to the Target Exploration
Properties except as may be required to confirm (a) the proper designation of
any assets and/or liabilities of Target and its subsidiaries as Spinco Assets
and/or Spinco Liabilities, as applicable, and (b) that the Spinco Assets and
Spinco Liabilities have been duly transferred to Spinco prior to the
Effective Time) as Acquiror may reasonably request. Acquiror and Target
acknowledge and agree that information furnished pursuant to this Section 7.4
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 7.5   Insurance and Indemnification

        | (a)   |  

Target shall be entitled to purchase run off directors  and officers
liability insurance for a period of up to six years from the  Effective Date
with the prior written consent of Acquiror, not to be  unreasonably withheld,
provided that the aggregate cost therefor does not  exceed 200% of the annual
premiums currently in effect. Acquiror shall  cause Target to ensure that the
articles and/or by-laws of Target and its  subsidiaries (or their respective
successors) shall contain the provisions  with respect to indemnification set
forth in Targets or the applicable  subsidiarys current articles and/or by-
laws, which provisions shall not,  except to the extent required by
applicable Laws, be amended, repealed or  otherwise modified for a period of
six years from the Effective Date in  any manner that would adversely affect
any rights of indemnification of  individuals who, immediately prior to the
Effective Date, were directors or officers of Target or any of its
subsidiaries. \- 63 -

         | (b)   |  

Acquiror agrees that it shall directly honour all rights  to indemnification
or exculpation now existing in favour of present and  former officers and
directors of Target and its subsidiaries to the extent  that they are
disclosed in Section 7.5(b) of the Target Disclosure Letter,  and
acknowledges that such rights, to the extent that they are disclosed  in
Section 7.5(b) of the Target Disclosure Letter, shall survive the  completion
of the Plan of Arrangement and shall continue in full force and  effect for a
period of not less than six years from the Effective  Date. 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

The provisions of this Section 7.5 are intended for the  benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified  Person, his or her
heirs and his or her legal representatives and, for  such purpose, Target
hereby confirms that it is acting as agent and  trustee on their behalf.
Furthermore, this Section 7.5 shall survive the  termination of this
Agreement as a result of the occurrence of the  Effective Date for a period
of six years. 

 

ARTICLE 8 
  ADDITIONAL SPINCO COVENANTS

 8.1   Spinco Indemnity

 

From the Effective Time, Spinco hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless
Acquiror, Acquiror Sub, Target and its subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified
Party") from all losses suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party as a
result of or arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with an
Indemnified Liability; provided that Spinco shall have no liability hereunder
in respect of any Claims unless an Indemnified Party shall have delivered an
Indemnity Notice in respect of such Claim within six (6) years following the
Effective Date, provided that Spinco shall have liability hereunder in
respect of any Claims for Taxes provided that an Indemnified Party shall have
delivered an Indemnity Notice in respect of such Claim prior to the date that
is sixty (60) days following the expiration of the relevant statutes of
limitation (including all periods of extension). If the Effective
Date occurs, this Section 8.1 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

 8.2   Indemnified Claims

        | (a)   |  

If any claim, proceeding, liability (including a  liability for Tax) or other
matter resulting from the occurrence of any of  the events contemplated by
Section 8.1 above (a "Claim") is made against  an Indemnified Party by a
third party for which the Indemnified Party may  be entitled to
indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall give notice  (an "Indemnity
Notice") to Spinco specifying the particulars of such Claim  within 20 days
after it receives notification of the Claim. Spinco shall  have the right to
participate in any negotiations or proceedings with  respect to any such
Claim. An Indemnified Party shall not settle or  compromise any such Claim
without the prior written consent of Spinco,  unless Spinco has not, within
20 Business Days after the giving of the  Indemnity Notice, given notice to
the Indemnified Party that it wishes to  dispute such Claim. If Spinco does
give such a notice, it shall have the right to assume the defence of such
Claim and to defend such Claim in the name of the Indemnified Party. \- 64 -

 

An Indemnified Party shall provide to Spinco all files, books, records and
other information in their possession or control which may be relevant to the
defence of such Claim. If Spinco fails after giving such notice, diligently
and reasonably to defend such Claim throughout the period such Claim exists,
its right to defend the Claim shall terminate and the Indemnified Party may
assume the defence of such Claim. In such event, the Indemnified Party
may assume the defence of such Claim. In such event, the Indemnified Party
may compromise or settle such Claim without the consent of Spinco. If the
Effective Date occurs, this Section 8.2 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

        | (b)   |  

Notwithstanding Section 8.2(a): 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

if a Claim described in Section 8.2(a) includes or would  reasonably be
expected to include both a Claim for Taxes that are  Indemnified Liabilities
(an "Indemnified Tax Claim") and a Claim  for Taxes that are not Indemnified
Liabilities (an "Unindemnified Tax  Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall use
reasonable commercial efforts  to separate the defence of the Indemnified Tax
Claim from the defence of  the Unindemnified Tax Claim, and in the case of
such separation Spinco  shall have the rights provided in Section 8.2(a) in
respect of the  Indemnified Tax Claim only; 

        | (ii)   |  

if the Indemnified Party is not able to separate the  defence of the
Indemnified Tax Claim from the defence of the Unindemnified  Tax Claim: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (A)   |  

the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the  defence of both
such Claims, including the right to settle either or both  of such Claims; 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (B)   |  

the Indemnified Party shall act in good faith with a view  to the merits in
connection with the defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim;  and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (C)   |  

the Indemnified Party shall afford Spinco the opportunity  to participate in
the defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim, provide Spinco  with notice and
access to documentation and information as is reasonable  in the
circumstances, otherwise keep Spinco updated and informed, and  consult with
Spinco with respect to the defence of the Indemnified Tax  Claim; 

      |   |   |     |   | (iii)   |  

the Indemnified Party shall provide Spinco with notice of  the resolution of
any Indemnified Tax Claim within 20 days of such  resolution; 

      |   |   | 
      | (iv)   |  

without limiting in any respect the Indemnified Partys  right to settle any
such Indemnified Claim in its absolute discretion, in  the event that Spinco
objects to a resolution of an Indemnified Tax Claim by delivering notice to
the Indemnified Party within 20 days of receiving the notice set out in
(iii), a neutral nationally recognized accountant (the "Tax Arbitrator") that
is mutually reasonably satisfactory to the parties shall determine the
amount, if any, by which: \- 65 -

         | (A)   |  

the amount of Tax for which the Indemnified Tax Claim was  resolved; exceeds 

      |   | 
      | (B)   |  

the amount of Tax for which the Indemnified Tax Claim  could reasonably have
been expected to be resolved if it had been the only  matter in dispute; 

 
        | (v)   |  

if the Tax Arbitrator determines that the amount  specified in 8.2(b)(iv)(A)
does not exceed the amount specified in  8.2(b)(iv)(B), Spinco shall be
liable for: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (A)   |  

pursuant to Section 8.1, the Indemnified Tax Claim based  on the amount
specified in Section 8.2(b)(iv)(A); and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (B)   |  

all costs and expenditures in respect of the arbitration,  including the
Indemnified Partys reasonable costs; 

      |   |   |     |   | (vi)   |  

if the Tax Arbitrator determines that the amount  specified in Section
8.2(b)(iv)(A) exceeds the amount specified in Section  8.2(b)(iv)(B) 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (A)   |  

pursuant to section 8.1, Spinco shall be liable for the  Indemnified Tax
Claim based on the amount specified in Section  8.2(b)(iv)(B); and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (B)   |  

the Indemnified Party shall be liable for Spincos  reasonable costs in
respect of the arbitration. 

 
        | (c)   |  

For greater certainty, notwithstanding any other  provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Acquiror shall be entitled to  control in all respects any
Tax proceedings relating to any consolidated,  combined or unitary group that
includes Acquiror or any of its  subsidiaries, and the above provisions of
this Section 8.2 shall not apply  to any such Tax proceedings. 

 8.3   Target Mining Properties

        | (a)   |  

Until the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, none  of Spinco or its
subsidiaries will, without Acquirors prior written  consent, stake, lease or
otherwise purchase or acquire or become entitled  to acquire, directly or
indirectly, alone or in concert with any other  person, any interest
whatsoever in any real property, land rights, surface  rights, water rights
or any mineral concessions, leases, claims or other  form of mineral rights
whatsoever, any part of which lies within the  boundary of, or within five
(5) miles of the perimeter of, any of the  Target Mining Properties
comprising the Long Canyon Property, the Sandman  Property and the
Northumberland Property, and if Spinco or any of its subsidiaries acquires
any such interest, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with any other
person, in contravention of the foregoing, such Spinco party will notify
Acquiror immediately and Spinco (or its subsidiary if applicable) will hold
such interest in trust for Acquiror and promptly convey such interest to
Acquiror at no cost. \- 66 -

         | (b)   |  

Until the first anniversary of the Effective Date, none  of Spinco or its
subsidiaries will, without Acquirors prior written  consent, stake, lease or
otherwise purchase or acquire or become entitled  to acquire, directly or
indirectly, alone or in concert with any other  person, any interest
whatsoever in any real property, land rights, surface  rights, water rights
or any mineral concessions, leases, claims or other  form of mineral rights
whatsoever, any part of which lies within the  boundary of, or within two (2)
miles of the perimeter of, any of the  Target Mining Properties (other than
the Long Canyon Property, the Sandman  Property or the Northumberland
Property), and if Spinco or any of its  subsidiaries acquires any such
interest, directly or indirectly, alone or  in concert with any other person,
in contravention of the foregoing, such  Spinco party will notify Acquiror
immediately and Spinco (or its  subsidiary if applicable) will hold such
interest in trust for Acquiror  and promptly convey such interest to Acquiror
at no cost. 

      |   |   | 
      | (c)   |  

Spinco covenants and agrees that it shall, and shall  cause its subsidiaries
to, treat all exploration information, data,  reports and studies including
all geological, geophysical and geochemical  information and data (including
all drill, sample and assay results and  all maps) and all technical reports,
feasibility studies and other similar  reports and studies concerning the
Target Mining Properties in the same  way Spinco treats its own confidential
information and shall use all  commercially reasonable efforts to keep all
such information confidential  and shall not make or keep copies of such
information or disclose any such  information to anyone other than Acquiror
or Acquirors Representatives  without Acquirors prior written consent
unless in the opinion of outside  legal counsel it is required to do so by
Law, except that the foregoing  shall not apply to information that: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

at the time of its disclosure is generally available in  the public domain;
or 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

enters the public domain and becomes generally available  at any time after
disclosure other than through a breach of the terms  hereof by (A) Spinco,
(B) any of its subsidiaries or (C) any of Spincos  legal or financial
advisors or consultants; or 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (iii)   |  

consists of general geological, geophysical, geochemical,  metallurgical or
operational concepts, models or  principles. 

 

If the Effective Date occurs, this Section 8.3 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.

 8.4  Non-Solicitation of Employees

 

For a period of two years following the Effective Date: \- 67 -

        | (a)   |  

Spinco agrees that it will not, and will cause its  subsidiaries and its and
its subsidiaries respective Representatives to  not, solicit, hire or engage
the services of any Retained Employee, or  persuade or attempt to persuade
any Retained Employee to terminate his or  her employment with Acquiror or
its subsidiaries, provided that the  foregoing restrictions shall not apply
to general solicitations of  employment not specifically directed at the
employees of Acquiror or its  subsidiaries nor to hiring employees of

Section 9.2(c)(v), by either Party pursuant to  Section 9.2(b)(i) or Section

where Acquiror would also be entitled to  terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.2(c)(iii), Section  9.2(c)(v) or Section 9.2(b)(iii)), but only
if, in the case of this  Section 9.4(a)(iii), prior to the earlier of the
termination of this  Agreement or the holding of the Target Meeting, an
Acquisition Proposal  shall have been made to Target, or the intention to

      |   |   | (B)   |

twelve months following the date of termination of this  Agreement), such
Acquisition Proposal is consummated; 

      |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |

        | (c)   |  

Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements  contained in this
Section 9.4 are an integral part of the transactions  contemplated in this
Agreement and that, without those agreements, the  Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. The Parties further  acknowledge and agree that the
Termination Fee is a payment of liquidated  damages which is a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages which Acquiror will  suffer or incur as a result of
the cancellation and termination of all  rights and obligations with respect
to the indirect acquisition of Target  by Acquiror, that such payments are
not for lost profits or a penalty, and  that no Party shall take any position
inconsistent with the foregoing.  Target irrevocably waives any right it may
have to raise as a defense that  any such liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. Acquiror hereby  acknowledges and agrees that, upon any termination
of this Agreement under  circumstances where Acquiror is entitled to the
Termination Fee and such  Termination Fee is paid in full to Acquiror,
Acquiror shall be precluded  from any other remedy against Target at law or
in equity or otherwise  (including, without limitation, an order for specific
performance), and  shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or
damages of any kind,  including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages,
against Target or  any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers,  employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or
affiliates in  connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated  hereby. 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |  

Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall relieve or have the  effect of relieving
any Party in any way from liability for damages  incurred or suffered by a
Party as a result of an intentional or wilful  breach of this Agreement. 

      |   | 
      | (e)   |  

Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall preclude a Party from  seeking injunctive
relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of  the covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or otherwise to  obtain specific
performance of any such covenants or agreements, without  the necessity of
posting bond or security in connection  therewith.

 10.5  Injunctive Relief

 

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages

provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any

 10.6  Further Assurances

 

Each of the Parties intends that, from and after the Effective Time, Target

all of the Spinco Liabilities. In order to give effect to the foregoing
intent, if following the Effective Time: \- 75 -

Spinco or Acquiror identifies any Target Mining  Properties which are held by
Spinco or its subsidiaries; or 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

Acquiror or Spinco identifies any Target Exploration  Properties, Spinco
Assets or Spinco Liabilities which are held or payable,  as applicable, by
Target or any of its subsidiaries, 

 

the Party making such identification will promptly give written notice to the
holder of such asset, property, Contract or liability and, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, the Party holding such
asset, property or Contract will, or if held by a subsidiary of such Party,
such Party will cause its subsidiary to transfer such asset, property or
Contract to or to the direction of the appropriate Party. In the event that
the Party making such identification identifies a Spinco Liability, Spinco
shall assume such liability as soon as practicable following receipt of such
notice by executing such documents or instruments as requested by Acquiror.
If the Effective Date occurs, this Section 10.6 shall survive the termination

 10.8  Entire Agreement, Binding Effect and Assignment

 

Acquiror may assign all or any part of its rights under this Agreement to,
and its obligations under this Agreement may be assumed by, a wholly-owned
direct or indirect subsidiary of Acquiror, provided that if such assignment
and/or assumption takes place, Acquiror shall continue to be liable jointly
and severally with such subsidiary for all of its obligations hereunder. This
Agreement shall be binding on and shall enure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

This Agreement (including the Schedules hereto and the Target Disclosure
Letter, including the schedules thereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement

understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and, except as
expressly provided herein, this Agreement is not intended to and shall
not confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies

Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned by either of the Parties without the prior written consent of the
other Party.

 10.9   Severability

 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. \- 76 -

 

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 10.10 Counterparts,  Execution

 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. The Parties shall be entitled to rely upon
delivery of an executed facsimile or similar executed electronic copy of this
Agreement, and such facsimile or similar executed electronic copy shall
be legally effective to create a valid and binding agreement between
the Parties.

Class A Share and one (1) Spinco Share, and such  Target Shares shall
thereupon be cancelled; 

      |   | 
      | (C)   |  

each Former Target Shareholder (other than Dissenting  Target Shareholders

stated capital of the outstanding Class  A Shares as contemplated in Section
3(a)(iv)(E) above. 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |

any provision of any applicable federal,  provincial, state, local or foreign
tax law, in each case, as amended. To  the extent that amounts are so

withholding was made, provided that  such withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate taxing  authority. -11-

KEY REGULATORY APPROVALS

       1\.   |  

To the extent Acquiror, acting reasonably, determines  applicable, expiration
or early termination of the applicable waiting  period under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as  amended, to the extent
applicable to the purchase of Target Shares as  contemplated in this
Agreement. Acquiror may make such determination by  written notice to Target
within seven (7) Business Days of the date of  this Agreement, or such later
date as Target and Acquiror may agree,  failing which Acquiror will be deemed
not to have made such a  determination, in which case only paragraph 2 below
will be a Key  Regulatory Approval. 

      |  


 
    2\.   |  

The issuance of an advance ruling certificate pursuant to  section 102 of the
Competition Act (Canada) in respect of the Arrangement  (and such advance
ruling certificate has not been rescinded prior to the  Effective Time), or
the expiration or termination of the waiting period  under section 123 of the

or the waiver of the merger notification  obligations pursuant to paragraph
113(c) of the Competition Act (Canada),  the Acquiror shall also have been
advised in writing by the Commissioner  of Competition that, in effect, such
person does not have sufficient  grounds at that time to apply to the
Competition Tribunal under section 92  of the Competition Act (Canada) with

the Commissioner of  Competition, at that time, does not intend to make an
application under  section 92 of the Competition Act (Canada) in respect of
the transactions  contemplated by the Arrangement (a "no-action letter" ),
and the form of  and any terms and conditions attached to any such advice are
acceptable to  the Acquiror, acting reasonably, and such advice has not been
