2.1. _Merger._

 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time:
(a) BOP shall merge with and into Investors Bank, with Investors Bank as the
resulting or surviving entity (the "Surviving Bank"), with its main office to
be maintained at 101 JFK Parkway, Short Hills, New Jersey 07078; and (b) the
separate existence of BOP shall cease and all of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties, assets, liabilities and
obligations of BOP shall be

 



9  vested in and assumed by Investors Bank. As part of the Merger, and except
as to Treasury Stock and Dissenting Shares, each share of BOP Common Stock
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the terms of Article III hereof.

2.2. _Closing; Effective Time._

 

The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur on the date determined
by Investors Bancorp, in consultation with and upon no less than two (2)
business days prior written notice to BOP, but in no event later than the
close of business on the tenth business day following the satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article IX (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) waiver of those conditions), or such other date
that may be agreed to in writing by the Parties. The Merger shall be effected
by the filing of a certificate with the NJ Department on the day of the
Closing (the "Closing Date"), in accordance with the New Jersey Banking Law.
The "Effective Time" means the date and time stated in the certificate filed
with the NJ Department, in accordance with the New Jersey Banking Law.

2.3.  _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._

The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Investors Bank as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Bank, until thereafter amended as
provided therein and by applicable law.

 

2.4. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Bank._

 

The directors of Investors Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Bank, each to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Bank, in
each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified. Until changed in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Bank, the officers of Investors Bank immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of Surviving Bank.

 

2.5. ___Effects of the Merger._

 

At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects as set
forth in the New Jersey Banking Law. The directors and executive officers,
and the principal office and each branch office of the Surviving Bank giving
effect to the Merger, are as set forth in ISBC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 2.5. The
main office of the Surviving Bank shall remain 101 JFK Parkway, Short Hills,
New Jersey 07078.

2.6. _Tax Consequences._

 

It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and
361 of the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
Closing, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any
action to be taken, fail to take any

 



10  action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to
act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code. Following the Closing, neither ISBC, Investors Bank, BOP
nor any of their affiliates shall knowingly take any action, cause any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken,
which action or failure to act could cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. ISBC, Investors Bank and BOP
each hereby agrees to deliver certificates substantially in compliance with
IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and
modifications thereto, to enable counsel to deliver the legal opinion
contemplated by Section 9.1.6, which certificates shall be effective as of the
date of such opinions.

 

2.7. _Possible Alternative Structures._

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX, prior
to the Effective Time ISBC shall be entitled to revise the structure of the
Merger described in Section 2.1 hereof, provided that (i) such modification
does not cause counsel to be unable to render the opinion contemplated by
Section 9.1.6; (ii) the consideration to be paid to the holders of BOP Common
Stock under this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind, value or reduced in
amount; and (iii) such modification will not delay materially or jeopardize
receipt of any required Regulatory Approvals or other consents and approvals
relating to the consummation of the Merger. The parties hereto agree to
appropriately amend this Agreement and any related documents in order to
reflect any such revised structure.

 

2.8. _Additional Actions._

 

If, at any time after the Effective Time, ISBC or Investors Bank shall
consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in
law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in ISBC or Investors Bank its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of BOP,
or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, BOP and its
officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to ISBC and Investors
Bank an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts as are necessary or
desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in ISBC or
Investors Bank its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of BOP or (b) otherwise carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, and the officers and directors of ISBC and Investors Bank are
authorized in the name of BOP or otherwise to take any and all such action.

 

ARTICLE III

CONVERSION OF SHARES

3.1. _Conversion of BOP Common Stock; Merger Consideration._

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of ISBC and Investors Bank, BOP or the holders of any of the shares of
BOP Common Stock, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the
following terms:

3.1.1. Each share of ISBC Common Stock and each share of Investors Bank
Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding following the Effective Time and
shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 



11 3.1.2. All shares of BOP Common Stock held in the treasury of BOP and each
share of BOP Common Stock owned by ISBC or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of ISBC or of BOP immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts
previously contracted) (collectively, "Treasury Stock"), shall, at the
Effective Time, cease to exist, and the certificates for such shares shall be
canceled as promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution
shall be made in consideration therefor.

 

3.1.3. Each share of BOP Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Stock and Dissenting Shares) shall
become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations
set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive at the election of the
holder thereof as provided in Section 3.2 either (i) $30.75 in cash
(the "Cash Consideration"); (ii) 2.633 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of ISBC
Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration"); or (iii) a combination hereof. The
Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to
herein collectively as the "Merger Consideration."

3.1.4. Each outstanding share of BOP Common Stock the holder of which has
perfected his right to dissent under the New Jersey Banking Law and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the New Jersey Banking Law. BOP
shall give ISBC prompt notice upon receipt by BOP of any such dissent and
related demand for payment of the value of such shares of BOP Common Stock
and of withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant
to applicable law (any stockholder duly making such demand being hereinafter
called a "Dissenting Stockholder"), and ISBC shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. BOP shall not, except with the prior written consent of ISBC,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such
Dissenting Stockholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under
the New Jersey Banking Law. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares
shall be made by the Surviving Bank.

3.1.5. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at or
prior to the Effective Time, such holderÂ’s shares of BOP Common Stock shall be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
the applicable provisions of this Agreement. If such holder shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such
payment after the Effective Time (or the Election Deadline, as defined
below), each share of BOP Common Stock of such holder shall be treated as a
Non-Election Share.

 



12 3.1.6. After the Effective Time, shares of BOP Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
shall thereafter by operation of this section be the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and as to Dissenting Shares shall represent only the
right to receive applicable payments as set forth in Section 3.1.4.

3.1.7. In the event ISBC changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of ISBC Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding ISBC Common Stock and the record
date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall
be proportionately and appropriately adjusted. In addition, in the event ISBC
enters into an agreement pursuant to which shares of ISBC Common Stock would
be converted into shares or other securities or obligations of another
corporation, proper provision shall be made in such agreement so that each
holder of BOP Common Stock entitled to receive shares of ISBC Common Stock in
the Merger shall be entitled to receive such number of shares or other
securities or amount or obligations of such other corporation as such
shareholder would be entitled to receive if the Effective Time had occurred
immediately prior to the happening of such event. 

3.2. _Election Procedures._

 

3.2.1. Holders of BOP Common Stock may elect to receive shares of ISBC Common
Stock or cash (in either case without interest) in exchange for their shares
of BOP Common Stock in accordance with the following procedures, provided
that, in the aggregate, 60% of the total number of shares of BOP Common Stock
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, including any
Dissenting Shares, but excluding any Treasury Stock (the "Stock Conversion
Number"), shall be converted into the Stock Consideration and the remaining
outstanding shares of BOP Common Stock shall be converted into the Cash
Consideration. Shares of BOP Common Stock as to which a Cash Election
(including, pursuant to a Mixed Election) has been made are referred to herein
as "Cash Election Shares." Shares of BOP Common Stock as to which a Stock
Election has been made (including, pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred
to as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of BOP Common Stock as to which no
election has been made (or as to which an Election Form is not returned
properly completed) are referred to herein as "Non-Election Shares." The
aggregate number of shares of BOP Common Stock with respect to which a Stock
Election has been made is referred to herein as the "Stock Election Number."
Any Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares, and the
holders thereof shall in no event receive consideration comprised of ISBC
Common Stock with respect to such shares.

 

3.2.2. An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
such Certificates to the Exchange Agent), in such form as BOP and ISBC shall
mutually agree ("Election Form"), shall be mailed not less than 20
business days but not more than 40 business days prior to the anticipated
Effective Time or on such earlier date as ISBC and BOP shall mutually agree
(the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of BOP Common Stock as of five
business days prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date").
Each Election Form shall permit such holder, subject to the

 



13  allocation and election procedures set forth in this Section 3.2, (i) to
elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all of the shares of BOP Common
Stock held by such holder (a "Cash Election"), in accordance with Section
3.1.3, (ii) to elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all of such shares
(a "Stock Election"), in accordance with Section 3.1.3, (iii) to elect to
receive the Stock Consideration for a part of such holderÂ’s BOP Common Stock
and the Cash Consideration for the remaining part of such holderÂ’s BOP Common
Stock (the "Cash/Stock Consideration") (an election to receive the Cash/Stock
Consideration is referred to as a "Mixed Election"), or (iv) to indicate that
such record holder has no preference as to the receipt of cash or ISBC Common
Stock for such shares (a "Non-Election"). A holder of record of shares of BOP
Common Stock who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another
representative capacity (a "Representative") may submit multiple Election
Forms, provided that each such Election Form covers all the shares of BOP
Common Stock held by such Representative for a particular beneficial owner.
Any shares of BOP Common Stock with respect to which the holder thereof shall
not, as of the Election Deadline, have made an election by submission to the
Exchange Agent of an effective, properly completed Election Form shall be
deemed Non-Election Shares. All Dissenting Shares shall be deemed shares
subject to a Cash Election, and with respect to such shares the holders
thereof shall in no event receive consideration comprised of ISBC Common
Stock, subject to Section 3.1.5 hereof.

3.2.3. To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted
to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 20th
day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as ISBC and BOP
may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline"); provided, however, that the
Election Deadline may not occur on or after the Closing Date. BOP shall
provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to
perform as specified herein. An election shall have been properly made only if
the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election
Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly
completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary
affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all
shares of BOP Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly
executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. If a BOP
stockholder either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form in a
timely fashion or (ii) revokes its Election Form prior to the Election
Deadline, the shares of BOP Common Stock held by such stockholder shall be
designated as Non-Election Shares. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed
by the person submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written
notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice of revocation or change
is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election
Deadline. ISBC shall cause the Certificate or Certificates relating to any
revoked Election Form to be promptly returned without charge to the person
submitting the Election Form to the Exchange Agent. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have
discretion to determine when any election, modification or revocation is
received and whether any such election, modification or revocation has been
properly made.

3.2.4. If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then
all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and, subject to Section 3.2.6
hereof, each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the
Stock Consideration only with respect to that number of

 



14  Stock Election Shares held by such holder equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number
of such holderÂ’s Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration.

 

3.2.5. If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number
(the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election
Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall
be treated in the following manner:

(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and, subject to Section 3.2.6 hereof,
each holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in
respect of that number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held
by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall
Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election
Shares, with the remaining number of such holderÂ’s Non-Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or

 

if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all
Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration, and, subject to Section 3.2.6 hereof, each holder of Cash
Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such
holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1)
the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and
the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with
the remaining number of such holderÂ’s Cash Election Shares being converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

 

3.2.6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of ISBC Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to ISBC Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share interest, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of ISBC. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
ISBC shall pay to each former holder of BOP Common Stock who otherwise would
be entitled to receive a fractional share of ISBC Common Stock, an amount in
cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product
of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled and (ii) the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of
ISBC Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading
days immediately preceding the Closing Date. For purposes of determining any
fractional share interest, all shares of BOP Common Stock owned by a BOP
stockholder shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole
shares of ISBC Common Stock issuable to such BOP stockholder.

 



15 3.3. _Procedures for Exchange of BOP Common Stock._

 

3.3.1. After the Election Deadline and no later than the day prior to the
Closing Date, ISBC shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of BOP Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3, certificates representing the
shares of ISBC Common Stock, or at ISBCÂ’s option, evidence of shares in book
entry form, and an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
amount of cash payable pursuant to this Article III (including the estimated
amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of BOP Common Stock)
(such cash and certificates for shares of ISBC Common Stock, together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (without any interest
thereon) being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

 

3.3.2. ISBC shall take all steps necessary to cause the Exchange Agent, within
five (5) business days after the Effective Time, to mail to each holder of a
Certificate or Certificates who has not previously surrendered such
Certificates with an Election Form, a form letter of transmittal for return to
the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which the BOP Common Stock represented by such
Certificates shall have been converted as a result of the Merger if any. The
letter of transmittal (which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of
BOP) shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to which
such holder of BOP common stock shall have become entitled pursuant to Section
3.1.3 hereof, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any Cash Consideration or any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares or any unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.

3.3.3. The holder of a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented
issued and outstanding BOP Common Stock shall have no rights, after the
Effective Time, with respect to such BOP Common Stock except to surrender the
Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective
Time with respect to ISBC Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of ISBC Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

 

3.3.4. If the Person surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying
letter of transmittal is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a
condition of the payment of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such
Certificate is properly endorsed to such Person or is accompanied by
appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name of the
record holder appears on such Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form
for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate evidence of the authority of
the Person surrendering such Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal
to do so on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the person

 



16  requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for
any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

3.3.5. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of BOP of the BOP Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration and
canceled as provided in this Section 3.3.

3.3.6. At any time following the six (6) month period after the Effective
Time, ISBC shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it
any portions of the Exchange Fund which had been made available to the
Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates (including,
without limitation, all interest and other income received by the Exchange
Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look to ISBC (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any Merger Consideration that
may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither ISBC nor the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered
in respect of such Certificate to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar law.

3.3.7. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by ISBC, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as ISBC may reasonably direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof. 

3.3.8. The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of BOP Common Stock such
amounts as the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of
U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such
amounts are properly withheld by the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the BOP Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by the Exchange Agent.

3.4. _Reservation of Shares._

 

ISBC shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of the ISBC
Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of ISBC Common Stock to the
BOP stockholders in accordance with this Article III.

3.5. _Treatment of BOP Stock Options, BOP Restricted Shares and BOP Warrants_

3.5.1 Holders of all outstanding and unexercised BOP Stock Options ("BOP
Option Holders"), whether or not vested, as of the Effective Time will be
entitled to receive, in

 



17  cancellation of their BOP Stock Options, a cash payment from Investors Bank
(or at the request of ISBC, by BOP) equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of BOP Common Stock subject to such BOP Option at the Effective Time
and (ii) the amount by which the Cash Consideration exceeds the exercise price
per share of such BOP Option (the "Option Consideration"). In the event that
the exercise price of a BOP Option is greater than or equal to the Cash
Consideration, then the holders thereof shall not be entitled to receive the
Option Consideration, and at the Effective Time such BOP Option shall be
canceled without any payment made in exchange therefor. The
Option Consideration shall be treated as compensation and shall be payable
net of any applicable federal and state income and employment withholding
taxes. Subject to the foregoing, the BOP Stock Plans, including all underlying
award agreements, and all BOP Options issued thereunder, shall terminate at
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, BOP shall take all actions as
necessary to give effect to such transactions, including, without limitation,
taking such actions as are necessary or required under the BOP Option Plan to
terminate the BOP Stock Options as of the Effective Time and shall obtain
written consent from each option holder to the cancellation of the BOP Stock
Options in exchange for the Option Consideration, if applicable.

3.5.2 At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unvested BOP Restricted
Share that has been granted under the BOP Stock Plans will become fully
vested and will be converted automatically into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

3.5.3 Holders of all outstanding BOP Warrants ("BOP Warrant Holders"),
whether or not vested, as of the Effective Time, will be entitled to receive,
in cancellation of their BOP Warrants, a cash payment from Investors Bank (or
at the request of ISBC, by BOP) equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of BOP Common Stock subject to such BOP Warrant at the Effective Time
and (ii) the amount by which the Cash Consideration exceeds the exercise price
per share of such BOP Warrant (the "Warrant Consideration"). In the event
that the exercise price of the BOP Warrant is greater than or equal to the
Cash Consideration, then the holders thereof shall not be entitled to the
Warrant Consideration, and at the Effective Time, such BOP Warrant shall be
canceled without payment made in exchange therefor. Subject to the foregoing,
the BOP Warrant plans, as applicable, including all underlying award
agreements, and all BOP Warrants issued thereunder, shall terminate at
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, BOP shall take all actions
as necessary to give effect to such transactions, including, without
limitation, taking such actions as are necessary or required under the BOP
Warrant plan or award agreement, if applicable, to terminate the BOP Warrants
as of the Effective Time and shall obtain written consent from each warrant
holder to the cancellation of the BOP Warrants in exchange for the Warrant
Consideration, if applicable.

4.6. _Financial Statements and Reports._

The BOP Financial Statements (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of BOP and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of

GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect
only actual transactions. BDO USA, LLP has not resigned (or informed BOP that
it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
BOP as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with BOP on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

 

4.6.2. At the date of each balance sheet included in the BOP Financial
Statements, BOP did not have any liabilities, obligations or
loss contingencies of any nature

 



22  (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a type required to
be reflected in such BOP Financial Statements or in the footnotes thereto
which are not fully reflected or reserved against therein or fully disclosed
in a footnote thereto, except for liabilities, obligations and loss
contingencies which are not material individually or in the aggregate or which
are incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice, and except for liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which
are within the subject matter of a specific representation and warranty herein
and subject, in the case of any unaudited statements, to normal, recurring
audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes.

definitive proxy statements and other documents required to be filed with or
furnished to the FDIC pursuant to the Exchange Act ("BOP Reports"), and no BOP
Report, as of the date thereof (and, in the case of proxy statements, on the
dates of the relevant meetings), contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this
Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of
their respective dates, all BOP Reports complied in all material respects
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As
of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of BOP has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or

date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved
issues raised by the FDIC with respect to any of the BOP Reports. [NOTE: if

timely filed. You can disclose the 12b-25 filing in a Disclosure Schedule.]

 

4.6.4. BOP has timely filed all reports, forms, schedules, registrations,
statements and other documents, together with any amendments required to be

assessments due and payable in connection therewith. The BOP

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of BOP or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on BOP. Except as set forth in BOP
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.6.5, BOP (x) has implemented and maintains a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of
the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and to provide
reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
managementÂ’s general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial

 



23  statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets
and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managementÂ’s
general or specific authorization, (y) has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to BOP, including

hereof, to BOP outside auditors and the audit committee of the BOP Board (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
BOP ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information
and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in BOP internal control over financial
reporting. These disclosures (if any) were made in writing by management to
BOP auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available
to BOP.

 

4.6.6. Since December 31, 2012, (i) neither BOP nor any of the BOP
Subsidiaries nor, to its Knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or representative of it or any of its subsidiaries has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of it or any of its
subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that it or any of its
subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (ii) no attorney representing it or any of its subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by it or any of its subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by it or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to its
board of directors or any committee thereof or to any of its directors or
officers.

 

4.7. _Taxes._

BOP and the BOP Subsidiaries are members of the same affiliated group within

filed all federal, state and local tax returns required to be filed by or with

SCHEDULE 4.7, BOP has received no written notice of, and to BOPÂ’s Knowledge
there is no audit examination, deficiency assessment, tax investigation or
refund litigation with respect to any taxes of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary, and
no claim has been made by any authority in a jurisdiction where BOP or any
BOP Subsidiary do not file tax returns that BOP or any such BOP Subsidiary is
subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. Except as set forth in BOP
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.7, BOP and the BOP Subsidiaries have not executed an
extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or
collection of any material tax due that is currently in effect. BOP and each

consent of, the lessor or its agent as a result of the Merger by virtue of
the terms of any such lease, is listed in

 



25  BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.2 identifying the section of the lease that
contains such prohibition or restriction. Subject to any consents that may be
required as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to
its Knowledge, neither BOP nor any BOP Subsidiary is in default in any
material respect under any BOP Contract, lease, insurance policy or other
instrument to which it is a party, by which its assets, business,
or operations may be bound or affected, or under which it or its assets,
business, or operations receive benefits, and there has not occurred any event

future benefits thereunder. Except as set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE

acceleration in the vesting of benefits or payments due thereunder upon the
occurrence of a change in ownership or control of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary or
upon the occurrence of a subsequent event; or (y) requires BOP or any BOP
Subsidiary to provide a benefit in the form of BOP Common Stock or determined

consistent with past practice, (viii) changed any accounting methods,
principles or practices of BOP affecting its assets, liabilities or
businesses, including any reserving, renewal or residual method, practice
or policy or (ix) suffered any strike, work stoppage, slow-down, or other
labor disturbance.

4.10. _Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage._

4.10.1. Except as set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.10.1, BOP and each
BOP Subsidiary has good and, as to real property, marketable title to all
material assets and properties owned by BOP or each BOP Subsidiary in the
conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or
personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in
the balance sheet contained in the most recent BOP Financial Statements or
acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets and
properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the
date of such balance sheet), subject to no material encumbrances, liens,
mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure
liabilities for public or statutory obligations or any discount with,
borrowing from or other obligations to the FHLB of New York and Atlantic
Community Bankers Bank, inter-bank credit facilities, reverse repurchase
agreements or any transaction by BOP or a BOP Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary
capacity, (ii) mechanics liens and similar liens for labor, materials,
services or supplies provided for such property and incurred in the ordinary
course of business for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested
in good faith, and (iii) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or
which are being contested in good faith. BOP and the BOP Subsidiaries, as
lessee, have the right under valid and existing leases of real and personal
properties used by BOP and the BOP Subsidiaries in the conduct of their
businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently occupied and
used by each of them.

4.10.2. With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which BOP or any
BOP Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if
any, BOP or such BOP Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security
interest (which to BOPÂ’s Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien) in the
securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the
value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured
thereby.

 

4.10.3. BOP and each BOP Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered by
each of them to be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither BOP
nor any BOP Subsidiary has received notice from any insurance carrier that (i)
such insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or
eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of
insurance will be substantially increased. There are presently no material
claims pending under such policies of insurance and no notices have been given
by BOP or any BOP Subsidiary under such policies. All such insurance is valid
and enforceable and in full force and effect, and within the last three years
BOP and each BOP Subsidiary have received each type of insurance coverage for
which they have applied and during such periods have not been denied
indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of its insurance
policies. BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.10.3 identifies all policies of insurance
maintained by BOP and each BOP Subsidiary as well as the other matters
required to be disclosed under this Section.

 



27 4.11. _Legal Proceedings._

 

Except as set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.11, there is no suit, action,
investigation or proceeding pending or, to its Knowledge, threatened against
or affecting BOP or its Subsidiaries (and BOP is not aware of any facts that
reasonably could be expected to be the basis for any such suit, action or
proceeding) (1) that involves a Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator, or (2)
that, individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to BOP, would
be (A) material to its businesses, or (B) reasonably likely to prevent or
delay it from performing its obligations under, or consummating
the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. There is no injunction,
order, award, judgment, settlement, decree or regulatory restriction imposed
upon or entered into by BOP or any Subsidiary or to which its or its
SubsidiaryÂ’s assets are subject.

4.12. _Compliance With Applicable Law._

 

4.12.1. To BOPÂ’s Knowledge, each of BOP and each BOP Subsidiary is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state, local
and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders
or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its
business, and its conduct of business and its relationship with its
employees, including, without limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank
Secrecy Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act
of 2008, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act
of 1977, and all other applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to
discriminatory business practices and neither BOP nor any BOP Subsidiary has
received any written notice to the contrary. The Board of Directors of BOP
has adopted and BOP has implemented an anti-money laundering program that
meets the requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the
regulations thereunder and has received no written notice from any
Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator that such program (i) does not contain
adequate and appropriate customer identification verification procedures; or
(ii) has been deemed ineffective.

 

4.12.2. Each of BOP and each BOP Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications and registrations with, all Bank Regulators and Governmental
Entities that are required to permit it to own or lease its properties and to
conduct its business as presently conducted; all such permits, licenses,
certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect
and, to the Knowledge of BOP, no suspension or cancellation of any such
permit, license, certificate, order or approval is threatened or will result
from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
subject to obtaining the receipt of Regulatory Approvals.

4.12.3. Except as disclosed in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.12.3, for the period
beginning January 1, 2013, neither BOP nor any BOP Subsidiary has received any
written notification or, to BOPÂ’s Knowledge, any other communication from any
Bank Regulator (i) asserting that BOP or any BOP Subsidiary is not in
material compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which
such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening to revoke any license,
franchise, permit or governmental authorization which is material to BOP or
any BOP Subsidiary; (iii) requiring or threatening to require BOP or any BOP
Subsidiary, or indicating that BOP or any BOP Subsidiary may be required, to
enter into a cease and desist order, 

 



28  agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other agreement with any
federal or state governmental agency or authority which is charged with the
supervision or regulation of banks or engages in the insurance of bank
deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit, in any
material respect the operations of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary, including
without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or
(iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or
limit, in any material manner the operations of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary (any
such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or order described in this
sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory Agreement"). Neither BOP
nor any BOP Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any Regulatory
Agreement that is currently in effect. The most recent regulatory rating given
to BOP as to compliance with the CRA is "Satisfactory" or better.

4.13. _Employee Benefit Plans._

 

4.13.1 BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.1 includes a list of all employment
agreements, change in control agreements, severance agreements
or arrangements, consulting agreements, existing bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee
stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option,
stock appreciation, phantom stock, severance, welfare benefit plans, fringe
benefit plans, employment, severance and change in control agreements and all
other material benefit practices, policies and arrangements (including paid
time-off policies and other material benefit policies and procedures)
maintained by BOP or any BOP Subsidiary in which any employee or former
employee, consultant or former consultant or director or former director of
BOP or any BOP Subsidiary participates or to which any such employee,
consultant or director is a party or is otherwise entitled to receive benefits
(the "BOP Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Except as set forth in BOP
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.1, neither BOP nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
commitment to create any additional Compensation and Benefit Plan or to
materially modify, change or renew any existing Compensation and Benefit Plan
(any modification or change that extends the term and/or increases the cost of
such plans would be deemed material), except as required to maintain the
qualified status thereof. BOP has made available to ISBC true and correct
copies of the Compensation and Benefit Plans. Except as set forth in BOP
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.1, there are no available or outstanding unvested or
unexercised options or awards under any BOP Compensation and Benefit Plan.

4.13.2 To the Knowledge of BOP, each BOP Compensation and Benefit Plan has
been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and with applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code,
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, COBRA, HIPAA and the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") and any regulations or
rules promulgated thereunder, and all material filings, disclosures and
notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, HIPAA and ACA and any other
applicable law have been timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or
other impositions for late filings have been paid in full. Each BOP
Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter or volume submitter plan advisory opinion
letter from the IRS, and BOP is not aware of any circumstances which are
reasonably likely to result in revocation of any such letter. There is no 

 



29  material pending or, to the Knowledge of BOP, threatened action, suit or
claim relating to any of the BOP Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than
routine claims for benefits). BOP has not engaged in a transaction, or
omitted to take any action, with respect to any BOP Compensation and Benefit
Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject BOP to a material unpaid tax
or penalty imposed by either Chapter 43 of the Code or Sections 409 or 502 of
ERISA.

4.13.3 Neither BOP nor any entity which is considered one employer with BOP
under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "BOP ERISA
Affiliate") (such plan hereinafter referred to as a "BOP ERISA Affiliate
Plan") currently maintains or has ever maintained an BOP Compensation and
Benefit Plan which is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of
ERISA. Neither BOP nor any BOP ERISA Affiliate has contributed to any
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

 

4.13.4 Except as set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.4, all material
contributions required to be made under the terms of any BOP Compensation and
Benefit Plan or BOP ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee benefit arrangements
to which BOP or any BOP Subsidiary is a party or a sponsor have been timely
made, and all anticipated contributions and funding obligations are accrued
on BOPÂ’s consolidated financial statements to the extent required by GAAP.
BOP and its Subsidiaries have expensed and accrued as a liability the present
value of future benefits under each applicable BOP Compensation and Benefit
Plan for financial reporting purposes as required by GAAP.

4.13.5 Except as set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.5, neither BOP nor
any BOP Subsidiary has any obligations to provide retiree health, life
insurance, disability insurance, or other retiree death benefits under any BOP
Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by COBRA. Except
as set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.5, there has been no
communication to employees by BOP or any BOP Subsidiary that would reasonably
be expected to promise or guarantee such employees retiree health, life
insurance, disability insurance, or other retiree death benefits.

4.13.6 Except as set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.6, BOP and its
Subsidiaries do not maintain any BOP Compensation and Benefit Plans covering
employees who are not United States residents.

4.13.7 Except as set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.7, with respect to
each BOP Compensation and Benefit Plan, if applicable, BOP has provided or
made available to ISBC copies of the: (A) trust instruments and insurance
contracts; (B) two most recent Forms 5500 filed with the IRS; (C) two most

the last two years; (G) most recent nondiscrimination tests performed under
ERISA and the Code (including 401(k) and 401(m) tests), if applicable; and
(H) all material communications with any Governmental Entity with respect to
any BOP Compensation and Benefit Plan.

 



30 4.13.8 Except as disclosed in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.8, the consummation
of the Merger will not, directly or indirectly (including, without
limitation, as a result of any termination of employment or service at any
time prior to or following the Effective Time) (A) entitle any employee,
consultant or director to any payment or benefit (including severance pay,
change in control benefit, or similar compensation) or any increase in
compensation, (B) entitle any employee or independent contractor to terminate
any plan, agreement or arrangement without cause or good reason and continue
to accrue future benefits thereunder, or result in the vesting or acceleration
of any benefits under the BOP Compensation and Benefit Plan; (C) result in the
vesting or acceleration of any benefits under any Compensation and Benefit
Plan; or (D) result in any material increase in benefits payable under any
BOP Compensation and Benefit Plan.

4.13.9 Except as disclosed in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.9, BOP
Compensation and Benefit Plans that are deferred compensation plans, programs
or arrangements (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) of BOP have
been in compliance (both written and operational) with Section 409A of the
Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder. All stock options and stock
appreciation rights granted by BOP to any current or former employee or
director have been granted with a per share exercise price or reference price
at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date
the option or stock appreciation right was granted, within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code and associated guidance.

 

4.13.10 Except as disclosed in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.10, the
consummation of the Merger will not, directly or indirectly
(including without limitation, as a result of any termination of employment
or service at any time prior to or following the Effective Time), entitle any
current or former employee, director or independent contractor of BOP or any
BOP Subsidiary to any actual or deemed payment (or benefit) which could
constitute a "parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of
the Code).

 

4.13.11 Except as disclosed in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.3.4, there are no
stock option or stock appreciation or similar rights, earned dividends or
dividend equivalents, or shares of restricted stock, outstanding under any of
the BOP Compensation and Benefit Plans or otherwise as of the date hereof and
none will be granted, awarded, or credited after the date hereof.

 

4.13.12 BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.12 includes a schedule of all termination
benefits and related payments that would be payable to the individuals
identified thereon, under any and all employment agreements, special
termination agreements, change in control agreements, severance arrangements
or policies, supplemental executive retirement plans, deferred bonus plans,
deferred compensation plans, salary continuation plans, or any material
compensation arrangement, or other pension benefit or welfare benefit plan
maintained by BOP or any BOP Subsidiary for the benefit of officers, employee
or directors of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary (the "Benefits Schedule"), assuming
their employment or service is terminated without cause as of September 30,
2016 and the Closing Date occurs on such date and based on the other
assumptions specified in such schedule. No other individuals are entitled to
benefits under any such plans.

 



31 4.13.13 BOP has obtained written consent for each employee on whose behalf
bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") has been purchased.

4.14. _Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors._

 

Neither BOP nor any BOP Subsidiary, nor any BOP Representative, has employed
any broker, finder or financial advisor in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or incurred any liability or commitment for
any fees or commissions to any such person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except for the engagement letter with
Sandler OÂ’Neill and Partners, L.P. ("Sandler OÂ’Neill"), a copy of which is
attached to BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.14.

4.15.  _Environmental Matters._

4.15.1. With respect to BOP and each BOP Subsidiary:

 

(A) To the Knowledge of BOP, neither the conduct nor operation of its business
nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned or operated
by it (including Participation Facilities and Other Real Estate Owned) results
or resulted in a violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely
to impose a material liability (including a material remediation
obligation) upon BOP or any BOP Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of BOP, no
condition has existed or event has occurred with respect to any of them or any
such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably
likely to result in any material liability to BOP or any BOP Subsidiary by
reason of any Environmental Laws. Neither BOP nor any BOP Subsidiary during
the past five years has received any written notice from any Person or
Governmental Entity that BOP or any BOP Subsidiary or the operation or
condition of any property ever owned or operated (including Participation
Facilities), by any of them are currently in violation of or otherwise are
alleged to have liability under any Environmental Laws or relating
to Materials of Environmental Concern (including, but not limited to,
responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other
remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or
originating from any such property) for which a material liability is
reasonably likely to be imposed upon BOP or any BOP Subsidiary;

(B) There is no suit, action, executive or administrative order, directive,
or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of BOP threatened, before any
court, governmental agency or other forum against BOP or any BOP Subsidiary
(i) for alleged noncompliance with, or liability under, any Environmental Law
or (ii) relating to the presence of or Release of any Materials of
Environmental Concern, on a site owned, leased or operated by BOP or any BOP
Subsidiary (including Participation Facilities and Other Real Estate Owned);

 

(C) To the Knowledge of BOP, (i) there are no underground storage tanks on, in
or under any properties owned or operated by BOP or any BOP Subsidiary
(including Participation Facilities and Other Real Estate Owned), and (ii) no
underground storage tanks have been closed or removed from any properties
owned or operated by BOP or any BOP Subsidiary (including Participation
Facilities and Other Real Estate Owned) except in compliance with
Environmental Laws in all material respects; and

(D) To the Knowledge of BOP, the properties currently owned or operated by
BOP or any BOP Subsidiary (including, without limitation, soil, groundwater or
surface water on, or under the properties, and buildings thereon) are not
contaminated with and do not otherwise contain any Materials of Environmental
Concern other than as permitted under applicable Environmental Law.

 



32 4.16. _Loan Portfolio and Investment Securities._

 

4.16.1. The allowance for loan losses reflected in the BOP Financial
Statements as of December 31, 2015 was, and the allowance for loan losses
reflected in the BOP Regulatory Reports and BOP Reports for periods ending
after December 31, 2015 will be, adequate, as of the dates thereof, under GAAP
in all material respects.

 

4.16.2. Except for any individual loans with principal outstanding balances of
less than $50,000, BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.16.2 sets forth a listing, as of
February 29, 2016, by account, of: (i) all loans (including loan
participations) of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary that have been accelerated during
the past twelve months by reason of a default or adverse developments in the
condition of the borrower or other events or circumstances affecting the
credit of the borrower; (ii) all loan commitments or lines of credit of BOP or
any BOP Subsidiary that have been terminated by BOP or any BOP Subsidiary
during the past twelve months by reason of a default or adverse developments
in the condition of the borrower or other events or circumstances affecting
the credit of the borrower; (iii) each borrower, customer or other party which
has notified BOP or any BOP Subsidiary during three years preceding the date
of this Agreement, or has asserted against BOP or any BOP Subsidiary, in each
case in writing, any "lender liability" or similar claim, and, to the
Knowledge of BOP, each borrower, customer or other party which has given BOP
or any BOP Subsidiary any oral notification of, or orally asserted to or
against BOP or any BOP Subsidiary, any such claim; (iv) all loans, (A) that
are contractually past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal
and/or interest, (B) that are on non-accrual status, (C) that are as of the
date of this Agreement classified as "substandard," "doubtful," "loss,"
"classified," "criticized," "watch list" or "special mention" (or words of
similar import) by BOP and any BOP Subsidiary, or any applicable Bank
Regulator, (D) to the Knowledge of BOP, as to which a reasonable doubt exists
as to the timely future collectability of principal and/or interest, whether
or not interest is still accruing or the loans are less than 90 days past due,
(E) where, during the past three years, the interest rate terms have been
reduced and/or the maturity dates have been extended subsequent to
the agreement under which the loan was originally created due to concerns
regarding the borrowerÂ’s ability to pay in accordance with such initial terms,
(F) where a specific reserve allocation exists in connection therewith, (G)
that are required to be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15; or (H)
made pursuant to an exception to policy, and (v) all assets classified by BOP
or any BOP Subsidiary as real estate acquired through foreclosure or in lieu
of foreclosure, including in-substance foreclosures, and all other assets
currently held that were acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of
foreclosure.

 

4.16.3. All loans receivable (including discounts) and accrued interest
entered on the books of BOP and the BOP Subsidiaries arose out of bona fide
armÂ’s-length transactions, were made for good and valuable consideration in
the ordinary course of BOPÂ’s or the appropriate BOP SubsidiaryÂ’s respective
business, and the notes or other evidences of 

 



33  indebtedness with respect to such loans (including discounts) are true and
genuine and are what they purport to be. Except for any individual loans with
a principal outstanding balance of less than $25,000, BOP has not received
written notice that any of the loans, discounts and the accrued interest
reflected on the books of BOP and the BOP Subsidiaries are subject to any
defenses, set-offs or counterclaims (including, without limitation, those
afforded by usury or truth-in-lending laws), except as may be provided by
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally
or by general principles of equity. All such loans are owned by BOP or the
appropriate BOP Subsidiary free and clear of any liens.

4.16.4. The notes and other evidences of indebtedness evidencing the loans
described above, and all pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust and other
collateral documents or security instruments relating thereto are, in all
material respects, valid, true and genuine, and what they purport to be.

 

4.16.5. BOP and each BOP Subsidiary have good and marketable title to all
securities owned by them, free and clear of any liens, except to the extent
such securities are pledged in the ordinary course of business to secure
obligations of BOP or a BOP Subsidiary. Such securities are valued on the
books of BOP in accordance with GAAP in all material respects. BOP and each
BOP Subsidiary that owns securities employ investment, securities, risk
management and other policies, practices and procedures which BOP believes are
prudent and reasonable.

 

4.17. _Other Documents._

 

BOP has made available to ISBC copies of (i) its annual reports to
stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and
(ii) proxy materials used or for use in connection with its meetings of
stockholders held in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

4.18. _Related Party Transactions._

Except as set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.18, neither BOP nor any BOP
Subsidiary is a party to any transaction (including any loan or other credit
accommodation) with any Affiliate of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary. Except as
described in BOPÂ’s DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.18, all such transactions (a) were
made in the ordinary course of business, (b) were made on substantially the
same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at
the time for comparable transactions with other Persons, and (c) did not
involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other
unfavorable features. No loan or credit accommodation to any Affiliate of BOP
or any BOP Subsidiary is presently in default or, during the three year period
prior to the date of this Agreement, has been in default or has been
restructured, modified or extended except for rate modifications pursuant to
BOPÂ’s loan modification policy that is applicable to all Persons. Neither BOP
nor any BOP Subsidiary has been notified that principal and interest with
respect to any such loan or other credit accommodation will not be paid when
due or that the loan grade classification accorded such loan or credit
accommodation by BOP is inappropriate.

 



34 4.19. _Deposits._

 

Except as set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.19, none of the deposits of
BOP is a "brokered deposit" as defined in 12 C.F.R. Section 337.6(a)(2).

requirements of any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate
transactions," "business combination" or other antitakeover laws and
regulations of any state.

 

The affirmative vote of two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of BOP
Common Stock is required to approve this Agreement and the Merger under the
New Jersey Banking Law and BOPÂ’s certificate of incorporation.

4.21. _Registration Obligations._

 

Neither BOP nor any BOP Subsidiary is under any obligation, contingent or
otherwise, which will survive the Effective Time by reason of any agreement
to register any transaction involving any of its securities under the
Securities Act.

4.22. _Risk Management Instruments._  

All material interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures and
forward contracts and other similar risk management arrangements, whether
entered into for BOPÂ’s own account, or for the account of one or more of BOPÂ’s
Subsidiaries or their customers (all of which are set forth in BOP DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.22), were in all material respects entered into in compliance with
all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory policies, and to the
Knowledge of BOP and each BOP Subsidiary, with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time; and to BOPÂ’s and each BOP SubsidiaryÂ’s
Knowledge each of them constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of
BOP or such BOP Subsidiary, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except
as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights or by
general equity principles), and is in full force and effect. Neither BOP nor
any BOP Subsidiary, nor, to the Knowledge of BOP, any other party thereto, is
in breach of any of its obligations under any such agreement or arrangement in
any material respect.

 

4.23. _Fairness Opinion._

 

BOP has received an opinion from Sandler OÂ’Neill, to the effect that, subject
to the terms, conditions and qualifications set forth therein, as of the date
hereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by the stockholders of BOP
pursuant to this Agreement is fair to common stockholders from a financial
point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date
of this Agreement.

 



35 4.24. _Intellectual Property._

 

BOP and each BOP Subsidiary owns or, to BOPÂ’s Knowledge, possesses valid and
binding licenses and other rights to use all patents, copyrights, trade
secrets, trade names, servicemarks and trademarks used in their business, each
without payment, and neither BOP nor any BOP Subsidiary has received any
notice of conflict with respect thereto that asserts the rights of others.
BOP and each BOP Subsidiary have performed all the obligations required to be
performed, and are not in default in any respect, under any contract,
agreement, arrangement or commitment relating to any of the foregoing. To the
Knowledge of BOP, the conduct of the business of BOP and each BOP Subsidiary
as currently conducted or proposed to be conducted does not, in any respect,
infringe upon, dilute, misappropriate or otherwise violate any intellectual
property owned or controlled by any third party.

4.25. _Trust Accounts_

 

Neither BOP nor any BOP Subsidiary has trust powers or acts as a fiduciary.

 

4.26. _Information Security_

 

Except as would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on BOP, to the knowledge of BOP,
since January 1, 2013, no third party has gained unauthorized access to any
information technology networks controlled by and material to the operation of
the business of BOP and its Subsidiaries.

material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the
notes thereto. The books and records of ISBC and its Subsidiaries have been,
and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and
any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only
actual transactions. KPMG LLP has not resigned (or informed ISBC that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of ISBC

of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure.

5.6.2. At the date of each balance sheet included in the ISBC Financial
Statements, ISBC did not have any liabilities, obligations or loss
contingencies of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a type required to be reflected in such ISBC Financial
Statements or in the footnotes thereto which are not fully reflected or
reserved against therein or fully disclosed in a footnote thereto, except for
liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which are not material
individually or in the aggregate or which are incurred in the ordinary course
of business, consistent with past practice, and except for liabilities,
obligations and loss contingencies which are within the subject matter of a
specific representation and warranty herein and subject, in the case of any
unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments and the absence
of footnotes.

furnished to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act ("ISBC Reports"), and no
ISBC Report, as of the date thereof (and, in the case of proxy statements, on
the dates of the relevant meetings), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information
filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their
respective dates, all ISBC Reports complied in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, no executive officer of ISBC has failed in any respect
to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of

this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues
raised by the SEC with respect to any of the ISBC Reports.

5.6.4. The records, systems, controls, data and information of ISBC and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any

 



40  electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of ISBC or its
Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ISBC. ISBC (x) has implemented
and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as
required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of its financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances that (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with managementÂ’s general or specific
authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managementÂ’s general or specific authorization, (y) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to ISBC, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of ISBC by others
within those entities, and (z) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to ISBC outside auditors and the audit
committee of ISBC Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect ISBC ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in ISBC internal control over financial reporting. These disclosures (if
any) were made in writing by management to ISBCÂ’s auditors and audit committee
and a copy has previously been made available to BOP.

obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of ISBC or any ISBC
Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that ISBC or any ISBC
Subsidiary has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(B) no attorney representing ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary, whether or not
employed by ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by it or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to its board of
directors or any committee thereof or to any of its directors or officers.

 

5.7. _Taxes._

ISBC and the ISBC Subsidiaries that are at least 80 percent owned by ISBC are

which (i) are not delinquent, (ii) are being contested in good faith, or (iii)
have not yet been fully determined. As of the date of this Agreement, ISBC has
received no notice of, and to the Knowledge of ISBC, there is no audit
examination, deficiency assessment, tax investigation or refund litigation
with respect to any taxes of ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary, and no claim has
been made by any authority in a jurisdiction where ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary
do not file tax returns that ISBC or any such ISBC Subsidiary is subject to
taxation in that jurisdiction. Except as set forth in ISBC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
5.7, ISBC and ISBC Subsidiary have not executed an extension or waiver of any
statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any material tax

circumstance arisen since that date which, in the aggregate, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on ISBC.

 

5.9. _Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage._

 

5.9.1. ISBC and each ISBC Subsidiary have good and, as to real property,
marketable title to all material assets and properties owned by ISBC or each
ISBC Subsidiary in the conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and
properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and
property reflected in the balance sheets contained in the ISBC Financial
Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such
assets and properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course of
business, since the date of such balance sheets), subject to no material
encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i)
those items which secure liabilities for public or statutory obligations or
any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to the FHLB of New
York, inter-bank credit facilities, or any transaction by a ISBC Subsidiary
acting in a fiduciary capacity, and (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet
delinquent or which are being contested in good faith. ISBC and each ISBC

occupied and used by each of them.

 

5.9.2. ISBC and each ISBC Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered
by ISBC to be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither ISBC nor
any ISBC Subsidiary has received notice from any insurance carrier that such
insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or
eliminated. All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force
and effect, and within the last three years ISBC and each ISBC Subsidiary
have received each type of insurance coverage for which they have applied and
during such periods have not been denied indemnification for any material
claims submitted under any of their insurance policies except as disclosed in
ISBC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.9.2.

suit, action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the
ISBC, threatened against or affecting the ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary (and the
ISBC is not aware of any facts that reasonably could be expected to be the
basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) (1) that involves
a Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator, or (2) that, individually or in the
aggregate, if determined adversely to the ISBC, would (A) have a Material
Adverse Effect on the ISBC, or (B) be reasonably likely to prevent or
materially delay it from performing its obligations under, or consummating
the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.

5.11. _Compliance With Applicable Law._ __

5.11.1. To the Knowledge of ISBC, each of ISBC and each ISBC Subsidiary are in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state, local
and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders
or decrees applicable to them, their properties, assets and deposits, their

Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act
of 1977, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and all other
applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory
business practices and neither ISBC nor any ISBC Subsidiary has received any
written notice to the contrary. The Board of Directors of Investors Bank has
adopted and Investors Bank has implemented an anti-money laundering program
that meets the requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and
the regulations thereunder and has received no written notice from any
Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator that such program (i) does not contain
adequate and appropriate customer identification verification procedures; or
(ii) has been deemed ineffective.

 

5.11.2. Each of ISBC and each ISBC Subsidiary have all material permits,
licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and have made all filings,
applications and registrations with, all Bank Regulators and Governmental
Entities that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of ISBC, no suspension or
cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is
threatened or will result from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining the approvals set forth
in Section 8.2.

5.11.3. Since January 1, 2013, and except as set forth in ISBC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 5.11.3, neither ISBC nor any ISBC Subsidiary has received any written
notification or, to the Knowledge of ISBC, any other communication from any
Bank Regulator (i) asserting that ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary is not in
material compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which
such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening to revoke any license,
franchise, permit or governmental authorization which is material to ISBC or
any ISBC

 



43  Subsidiary; (iii) requiring or threatening to require ISBC or any ISBC
Subsidiary, or indicating that ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary may be required, to
enter into a cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding
or any other agreement with any federal or state governmental agency or
authority which is charged with the supervision or regulation of banks or
engages in the insurance of bank deposits restricting or limiting, or
purporting to restrict or limit, in any material respect the operations of
ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on
the payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or
purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the operations of ISBC
or any ISBC Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the
payment of dividends (any such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or
order described in this sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory
Agreement"). Neither ISBC nor any ISBC Subsidiary has consented to or entered
into any currently effective Regulatory Agreement. The most recent regulatory
rating given to Investors Bank as to compliance with the CRA is
"Satisfactory" or better.

5.12. _Employee Benefit Plans._

 

5.12.1. ISBC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12.1 includes a list of all employment
agreements, change in control agreements, severance agreements
or arrangements, consulting agreements, existing bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee
stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option,
stock appreciation, phantom stock, severance, welfare benefit plans, fringe
benefit plans, employment, severance and change in control agreements and all
other benefit practices, policies and arrangements maintained by ISBC or any
ISBC Subsidiary and in which employees in general may participate (the "ISBC
Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Each ISBC Compensation and Benefit Plan has
been administered in form and in operation, in all material respects with its
terms and all applicable requirements of law and no notice has been issued by
any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging such compliance.

5.12.2. To the Knowledge of ISBC and except as disclosed in ISBC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 5.12.2, each ISBC Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with
applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
COBRA, HIPAA, ACA and any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all
material filings, disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
COBRA, HIPAA and ACA and any other applicable law have been timely made or any
interest, fines, penalties or other impositions for late filings have been
paid in full. Each ISBC Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received or has
requested and expects to receive a favorable determination letter or a volume
submitter plan advisory opinion letter from the IRS, and ISBC is not aware of
any circumstances which are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any
such letter. There is no material pending or, to the Knowledge of ISBC,
threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of the ISBC Compensation and
Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). Neither ISBC nor any
ISBC Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action,
with respect to any ISBC Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably
be expected to subject ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary to an unpaid tax or penalty
imposed by either Chapter 43 of the Code or Sections 409 or 502 of ERISA.

 



44 5.12.3. No liability to any Governmental Entity, other than PBGC premiums
arising in the ordinary course of business, has been or is expected by ISBC
or any of its Subsidiaries to be incurred with respect to any ISBC
Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a defined benefit plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA ("ISBC Defined Benefit Plan"), or with respect to any "single-
employer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or formerly
maintained by ISBC or any entity which is considered one employer with ISBC
under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ISBC ERISA
Affiliate") (such plan hereinafter referred to as an "ISBC ERISA Affiliate
Plan"). No ISBC Defined Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as
such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. To the Knowledge of ISBC,
except as set forth in ISBC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12.3, no ISBC Defined
Benefit Plan had an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section
302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the
most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof.

5.12.4. All material contributions required to be made under the terms of any
ISBC Compensation and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee
benefit arrangements to which ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary is a party or a
sponsor have been timely made, and all anticipated contributions and funding
obligations are accrued on ISBCÂ’s consolidated financial statements to the
extent required by GAAP. ISBC and its Subsidiaries have expensed and accrued
as a liability the present value of future benefits under each applicable
ISBC Compensation and Benefit Plan for financial reporting purposes as
required by GAAP.

5.13. _Environmental Matters._

 

5.13.1. To the Knowledge of ISBC, neither the conduct nor operation of its
business nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned or
operated by it or any ISBC Subsidiary (including, without limitation, in a
fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which it or any ISBC Subsidiary holds a
lien, results or resulted in a violation of any Environmental Laws that is
reasonably likely to impose a material liability (including a material
remediation obligation) upon ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of
ISBC, no condition has existed or event has occurred with respect to it or any
ISBC Subsidiary or any such property that, with notice or the passage of
time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in any material liability to
ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary by reason of any Environmental Laws. Neither ISBC
nor any ISBC Subsidiary has received any written notice from any Person that
ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary or the operation or condition of any property ever
owned, operated, or held as collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by any of
them are currently in violation of or otherwise are alleged to have financial
exposure under any Environmental Laws or relating to Materials of
Environmental Concern (including, but not limited to, responsibility (or
potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other remediation of any
Materials of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or originating from any
such property) for which a material liability is reasonably likely to be
imposed upon ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary.

 

5.13.2. There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the ISBCÂ’s
Knowledge, threatened, before any court, governmental agency or other forum
against ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary (x) for alleged noncompliance (including
by any predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law or (y)
relating to the presence of or release into the environment of any Materials
of Environmental Concern (as defined herein), whether or not occurring at or
on a site owned, leased or operated by ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary.

 



45 5.14. _Loan Portfolio._

 

The allowance for loan losses reflected in ISBCÂ’s audited consolidated
statement of condition at December 31, 2015 was, and the allowance for loan
losses shown on the balance sheets in ISBCÂ’s Financial Statements for periods
ending after December 31, 2015 were or will be, adequate, as of the dates
thereof, under GAAP.

 

5.15. _Risk Management Instruments._

 

All material interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures and
forward contracts and other similar risk management arrangements, whether
entered into for ISBCÂ’s own account, or for the account of one or more of
ISBCÂ’s Subsidiaries or their customers, were in all material respects entered
into in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
regulatory policies, and to the Knowledge of ISBC and each ISBC Subsidiary,
with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time; and
each of them constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of ISBC or
one of its Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general

operations at such times as ISBC may reasonably request.

its business or in the operation of its properties and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, of any governmental complaints, investigations
or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated),
or the institution or the threat of material litigation involving BOP or any
BOP Subsidiary. Any information provided pursuant to this Section 6.2 will be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and may only be used to facilitate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.2.2. BOP and Investors Bank shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and
plan for the conversion of BOPÂ’s data processing and related electronic
informational systems to those used by Investors Bank, which planning shall
include, but not be limited to, discussion of the possible (i) termination by
BOP of third-party service provider arrangements effective at the Effective
Time or at a date thereafter, (ii) non-renewal of personal property leases
and software licenses used by BOP in connection with its systems operations,
(iii) retention of outside consultants and additional employees to assist with
the conversion, and (iv) outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-
provided system services, it being understood that BOP shall not be obligated
to take any such action prior to the Effective Time and, unless BOP otherwise
agrees, in writing, no conversion shall take place prior to the Effective
Time. In the event that BOP takes, at the request of Investors Bank, any
action relative to third parties to facilitate the conversion that results in
the imposition of any termination fees or charges, Investors Bank shall pay
any such fees and charges directly to such third parties, and shall indemnify
BOP for the costs of reversing the conversion process, if for any reason the
Merger is not consummated for any reason other than a breach of
this Agreement by BOP, or a termination of this Agreement under Section
11.1.8, 11.1.9 or 11.1.10.

6.2.3. BOP shall provide Investors Bank, substantially contemporaneously with
the delivery to the Board of Directors of BOP of the materials for the monthly
board meeting, a written list of nonperforming assets as of the prior month
end (the term "nonperforming assets," for purposes of this subsection, means
(i) loans that are "troubled debt restructuring" as defined in Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 310-40, "Troubled
Debt Restructuring by Creditors," as updated by Accounting Standards Update
2011-02", (ii) loans on nonaccrual, (iii) OREO, (iv) all loans ninety (90)

6.2.4. BOP and ISBC shall promptly inform each other upon receiving notice of
any legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, demands,
notices, audits or investigations (by any federal, state or local commission,
agency or board) relating to the alleged liability of BOP or any BOP
Subsidiary or ISBC or any ISBC Subsidiary, respectively, under any labor or
employment law. 

6.3. _Access to Properties and Records._

 

6.3.1. Subject to Section 12.1 hereof, BOP shall permit ISBC and Investors
Bank reasonable access upon reasonable notice to its properties and those of
the BOP Subsidiaries, and shall disclose and make available to ISBC and
Investors Bank during normal business hours all

 



52  of its books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties,
operations, obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all
books of account (including the general ledger), tax records, minute books of
directorsÂ’ (other than minutes that discuss any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter BOP reasonably
determines should be treated as confidential) and stockholdersÂ’ meetings,
organizational documents, bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings
with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees,
and any other business activities or prospects in which ISBC and Investors
Bank may have a reasonable interest; provided, however, that BOP shall not be
required to take any action that would provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure, in BOPÂ’s reasonable judgment,
would interfere with the normal conduct of BOPÂ’s business or would violate or
prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or
other person or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting
communications between it and any of its counsel or with regard to which
disclosure to ISBC is prohibited by law or regulation. BOP shall provide and
shall request its auditors to provide ISBC with such historical financial
information regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) as ISBC may
reasonably request for securities disclosure purposes. ISBC and Investors Bank
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with
BOPÂ’s regular business operations during any such access to BOPÂ’s property,
books and records.

6.3.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3,
in no event shall ISBC have access to any information that, based on advice
of BOPÂ’s counsel, would (a) reasonably be expected to waive any material legal
privilege (b) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties
or (c) violate any obligation of BOP with respect to confidentiality so long
as, with respect to confidentiality, to the extent specifically requested by
ISBC, BOP has made commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver
regarding the possible disclosure from the third party to whom it owes an
obligation of confidentiality; it being understood that ISBC shall not conduct
any environmental sampling without the prior written consent of BOP, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. All requests
made pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be directed to an executive officer
of BOP or such Person or Persons as may be designated by BOP. All information
received pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

6.4. _Financial and Other Statements._

 

6.4.1. Promptly upon receipt thereof, BOP will furnish to ISBC copies of each
annual, interim or special audit of the books of BOP and each BOP Subsidiary
made by its independent auditors and copies of all internal control reports
submitted to BOP by such auditors in connection with each annual, interim or
special audit of the books of BOP and the BOP Subsidiaries made by such
auditors. 

6.4.2. BOP will furnish to ISBC copies of all documents, statements and
reports as it or any BOP Subsidiary shall send to its stockholders, the FDIC,
the Commissioner, or any other Regulatory Authority, except as legally
prohibited thereby. Within 15 days after the end of each month, BOP will
deliver to ISBC a list and description of loans originated by BOP since the
prior month end.

 



53 6.4.3. To the extent not prohibited by law or regulation, BOP will advise ISBC
promptly of the receipt of any examination report of any Bank Regulator with
respect to the condition or activities of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary.

6.4.4. With reasonable promptness, BOP will furnish to ISBC such additional
financial data that BOP possesses and as ISBC may reasonably request,
including without limitation, detailed monthly financial statements and loan
reports.

 

6.5. _Maintenance of Insurance._

 

BOP shall maintain, and cause the BOP Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance in
such amounts as are reasonable to cover such risks as are customary in
relation to the character and location of its properties and the nature of its
business.

6.6. _Disclosure Supplements._  

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, BOP will promptly supplement or
amend the BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct
any information in such BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such BOP
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

6.7. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

 

BOP shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause each BOP
Subsidiary to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals of any other persons necessary or
desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, BOP shall utilize
the services of a professional proxy soliciting firm to provide assistance in
obtaining the stockholder vote required to be obtained by it hereunder.

6.8.  _All Reasonable Efforts._

BOP agrees to use, and agrees to cause each BOP Subsidiary to use, all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.9. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

 

In the event that BOP determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive
that condition, it will promptly notify ISBC.

 



54 6.10. _No Solicitation._

 

6.10.1. BOP shall not, and shall cause the BOP Subsidiaries and the respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents
(collectively, the "BOP Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action
to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person
(other than ISBC) any information or data with respect to BOP or any of the
BOP Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv)
enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by BOP or any BOP Representative, whether or not such
BOP Representative is so authorized and whether or not such BOP Representative
is purporting to act on behalf of BOP or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by BOP. BOP and each BOP Subsidiary shall, and shall
cause each of BOP Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications
with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition
Proposal.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from ISBC),
whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any transaction or
series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving BOP
or any of the BOP Subsidiaries; (B) any transaction pursuant to which any
third party or group acquires or would acquire (whether through sale, lease or
other disposition), directly or indirectly, any assets of BOP or any of the
BOP Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of the assets of BOP and the BOP Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis;
(C) any issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such
securities) representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the votes
attached to the outstanding securities of BOP or any of the BOP Subsidiaries;
(D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
any third party or group beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more
of any class of equity securities of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary; or (E) any
transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing transactions, or any combination of the foregoing.

 

6.10.2. Notwithstanding Section 6.10.1, BOP may take any of the actions
described in clause (ii) of Section 6.10.1 only if, (i) BOP has received a
bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, prior to the BOP
Stockholders Meeting, that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.10;
(ii) the BOP Board determines in good faith, after consultation with and
having considered the advice of its outside legal counsel and its independent
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; (iii) BOP has provided ISBC with
at least one (1) full business day prior notice of such

 



55  determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any
information or data with respect to BOP or any of the BOP Subsidiaries or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, BOP receives from such Person
a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to BOP than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. BOP shall promptly provide to ISBC
any non-public information regarding BOP or the BOP Subsidiaries provided to
any other Person that was not previously provided to ISBC, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other party.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction on
terms that the BOP Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor (i) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition
of all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of BOP
Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of BOP and the
BOP Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a transaction
that (A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares of BOP Common
Stock that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the
consideration to be paid to the holders of BOP Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration
being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated
with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in addition to those
specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not conditioned upon
obtaining additional financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms of such
proposal, more favorable to the BOP Stockholders than the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely to
be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal.

6.10.3. BOP shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify ISBC in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, BOP or any BOP Representatives, in each
case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall
indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or
making such proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials
relating to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussion, providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other
electronic communications). BOP agrees that it shall keep ISBC informed, on a
current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposal, offer,
information request, negotiations or discussions (including any amendments or
modifications to such proposal, offer or request).

 

6.10.4. Subject to Section 6.10.5, neither the BOP Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to ISBC in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), the BOP
Recommendation (as defined in Section 8.1), or make any statement, filing or
release, in connection with BOP Stockholders Meeting or otherwise,
inconsistent with the BOP Recommendation (it being understood that taking a
neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall
be considered an adverse modification of the BOP Recommendation); (ii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause BOP or any of the BOP

 



56  Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition
Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.10.2 or (B) requiring BOP to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

Meeting, the BOP Board may approve or recommend to the stockholders of BOP a
Superior Proposal and withdraw, qualify or modify the BOP Recommendation in
connection therewith (a "BOP Subsequent Determination") after the third (3rd)
business day following ISBCÂ’s receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal") from BOP advising ISBC that the BOP Board has decided that a bona
fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not
result from a breach of this Section 6.10) constitutes a Superior Proposal
(it being understood that BOP shall be required to deliver a new Notice of
Superior Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third
party or its affiliates that BOP proposes to accept, and that the BOP
Board may approve or recommend the revised Superior Proposal only after the
third (3rd) business day following ISBCÂ’s receipt of the new Notice of
Superior Proposal) if, but only if, (i) the BOP Board has reasonably
determined in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, that the failure to
take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to BOPÂ’s
stockholders under applicable law, and (ii) at the end of such three (3)
business day period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or
amended terms as may have been committed to in writing by ISBC since its
receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal (provided, however, that ISBC
shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), the BOP Board has
again in good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section
6.10.5, and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying
of the BOP Recommendation or the making of a BOP Subsequent Determination by
the BOP Board shall not change the approval of the BOP Board for purposes of
causing any applicable "moratorium," "control share," "fair price,"
"takeover," "interested stockholder" or similar law to be inapplicable to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including
the Merger.

6.10.6. Nothing contained in this Section 6.10 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit BOP from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, to
the extent applicable.

6.11. _Board of Directors and Committee Meetings._

 

BOP shall permit representatives of ISBC or Investors Bank (no more than two)
to attend any meeting of its Board of Directors or the Executive and Loan
Committees thereof as an observer, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
provided that BOP shall not be required to permit the representative to remain
present during any confidential discussion of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or any third party proposal to acquire
control of BOP or during any other matter (i) that the respective Board of
Directors has reasonably determined to be confidential with respect to the
participation of ISBC or Investors Bank, or (ii) that BOP would not be
required to disclose under Section 6.3.3 hereof.

 



57 6.12 _Certain BOP Employee Benefit Plans._

 

6.12.1 BOP shall take all necessary actions to terminate the BOP 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. In connection with the termination
of the BOP 401(k) Plan, BOP or Investors Bank following the Effective Time,
shall use their best efforts to seek a favorable determination letter from the
IRS on the termination of the BOP 401(k) Plan. As soon as
administratively practicable following the receipt of such favorable
determination letter, the account balances of all participants and
beneficiaries in the BOP 401(k) Plan shall either be distributed to the
participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax-qualified
retirement plan or individual retirement account as a participant or
beneficiary may direct in accordance with the requirements of the Code and
ERISA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Continuing Employees may elect to roll
over their BOP 401(k) Plan accounts (excluding loans) into the Investors Bank
401(k) Plan. BOP shall adopt the necessary amendment(s) and board
resolution(s) to effect the provisions of this Section 6.12.1. 

6.12.2 BOP shall terminate the any BOP paid time off and/or vacation policy as
provided in BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 6.12.2 immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Any paid time off accrued or earned under the BOP PTO Policy by any
employee of BOP or BOP Subsidiary who does not become a Continuing Employee as
of the Effective Time shall be paid by BOP immediately prior to the Effective
Time. BOP shall adopt the necessary amendment(s) and board resolution(s) to
effect the provisions of this Section 6.12.2.

 

6.12.3 BOP shall terminate the BOP Stock Plans, including all underlying award
agreements, as of the Effective Time.

 

6.13 _Litigation._

BOP shall provide ISBC the opportunity to participate at ISBCÂ’s own expense
in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against BOP and/or
its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
no such settlement shall be agreed to without ISBCÂ’s prior written consent.

ARTICLE VII

 

COVENANTS OF ISBC AND INVESTORS BANK

 

7.1. _Conduct of Business._

 

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
except with the written consent of BOP, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, ISBC and Investors Bank
will, and they will cause each ISBC Subsidiary to operate its business in the
usual, regular and ordinary course of business, use reasonable efforts to
preserve intact its business organization and assets and maintain its rights
and franchises; and voluntarily take no action that would: (i) adversely
affect the ability of the parties to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or
materially increase the period of time necessary to obtain such approvals;
(ii) adversely affect its ability to perform its covenants and agreements
under this Agreement; or (iii) result in the representations and warranties
contained in Article V of this Agreement not being true and correct on the
date of this Agreement or at any future date on or prior to the Closing Date
or in any of the conditions set forth in Article IX hereof not being
satisfied. ISBC further

 



58  agrees that, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, except
as (a) otherwise specifically permitted or required by this Agreement, (b) set
forth in ISBC Disclosure Schedule 7.1, (c) consented to by BOP in writing and
such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, or
(d) required by any Bank Regulator, ISBC will not, and it will cause each ISBC
Subsidiary not to (i) take any action that is intended to, would or would be
reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article IX
not being satisfied or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except, in every case, as may be required
by applicable law; or (ii) take any action, or knowingly fail to take any
action, which action or failure to act prevents or impedes, or could
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

7.2. _Financial and Other Statements and Information._

ISBC will advise BOP promptly of the receipt of any examination report of any
Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of ISBC or any of
the ISBC Subsidiaries. During the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Closing Date, ISBC will cause one or more of its representatives to confer
with representatives of BOP and report the general status of its financial
condition, operations and business and matters relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby, at such times as BOP may reasonably
request. ISBC and Investors Bank shall be reasonably responsive to requests
by BOP for access to such information and personnel regarding ISBC and
Investors Bank as may be reasonably necessary for BOP to confirm that the
representations and warranties of ISBC and Investors Bank contained herein are
true and correct and that the covenants of ISBC and Investors Bank contained
herein have been performed in all material respects; provided, however, that
neither ISBC nor Investors Bank shall be required to take any action that
would provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure, in ISBCÂ’s or Investors BankÂ’s reasonable judgment, would interfere
with the normal conduct of ISBCÂ’s or Investors BankÂ’s business or would
violate or prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences of any
customer or other person or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege
protecting communications between it and any of its counsel.

 

7.3. _Disclosure Supplements._

 

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, ISBC will promptly supplement
or amend the ISBC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such ISBC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct
any information in such ISBC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered
inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such ISBC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Article IX.

7.4. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

 

ISBC and Investors Bank shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain as soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any other Persons
necessary or desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



59 7.5. _All Reasonable Efforts._

 

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, ISBC and Investors Bank
agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

7.6. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

 

In the event that ISBC or Investors Bank determines that a condition to its
obligation to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not
waive that condition, it will promptly notify BOP.

7.7. _Employee Benefits; Advisory Board; Foundation._

 

7.7.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, ISBC will review all the
BOP Compensation and Benefit Plans to determine whether to maintain,
terminate or continue such plans after the Effective Time. In the event that
any BOP Compensation and Benefit Plan is frozen or terminated by ISBC, ISBC
will use best efforts so that former employees of BOP who become employees of
ISBC or Investors Bank after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") who
were participants in such plan will become eligible to participate in any ISBC
Compensation and Benefit Plan of similar character (to extent that one exists,
other than any ISBC non-qualified deferred compensation plan, employment
agreement, change in control agreement or equity incentive plan or other
similar-type of arrangement), provided, however, that Continuing Employees
shall not be eligible to participate in the ISBC Defined Benefit Plan.
Continuing Employees who become participants in a ISBC Compensation and
Benefits Plan shall, for purposes of determining eligibility for and any
applicable vesting periods of such employee benefits only (and not for
benefit accrual purposes) be given credit for meeting eligibility and vesting
requirements in such plans for service as an employee of BOP or any
predecessor thereto prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that
credit for prior service shall be given under the ISBC ESOP only for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate in such plan and not for vesting
purposes, and provided further, that credit for prior service shall not be
given under the ISBC Defined Benefit Plan. This Agreement shall not be
construed to limit the ability of ISBC or Investors Bank to terminate the
employment of any BOP employee or to review any BOP Compensation and Benefit
Plan from time to time and to make such changes (including terminating any
such plan) as they deem appropriate.

7.7.2 ISBC shall honor the contractual terms of all employment, consulting,
change in control, severance and deferred compensation agreements, if any,
listed on BOP DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.1 (collectively, the "BOP Severance
Agreements"), except to the extent any such agreement is superseded or
terminated as of, or following, the Effective Time. The estimated amounts
payable under the BOP Severance Agreements are set forth in the Benefits
Schedule. To the extent any payments or benefits would constitute a "parachute
payment," such payments and/or benefits will be reduced to the extent
necessary to avoid penalties under Section 280G of the Code.

 



60 7.7.3 Any employee of BOP, other than an employee who is a party to an
employment agreement, change in control agreement or other separation
agreement that provides a benefit on a termination of employment, whose
employment is terminated involuntarily (other than for cause) within one year
following the Closing Date shall receive a lump sum severance payment from
Investors Bank equal to two weeksÂ’ pay at the rate then in effect, for each
full year of employment with BOP, with a minimum severance payment of four
weeks and up to a maximum of 26 weeks, provided that such employee enters
into a release of claims against ISBC and Investors Bank, their Subsidiaries
and affiliates in a form satisfactory to ISBC.

7.7.4 In the event of any termination of any BOP health plan or consolidation
of any such plan with any ISBC or Investors Bank health plan, ISBC shall make
available to Continuing Employees and their dependents employer-provided
health coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to ISBC
employees. Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage
under a BOP health plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee
becomes eligible to participate in the ISBC health plan, no coverage of any
of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of
the BOP health plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their
dependents become eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and
benefits common to all employees of ISBC and their dependents. In the event of
a termination or consolidation of any BOP health plan, terminated BOP
employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of ISBC in accordance with COBRA.

7.7.5 ISBC and Investors Bank agree to take all such actions related to the
BOP 401(k) Plan as stated in Section 6.12 of this Agreement.

7.7.6 Effective as of the Closing Date, Investors Bank will appoint all
members of the BOP Board as of the date of this Agreement to serve as paid
members of an advisory board (the "Advisory Board"), the function of which
will be, among other things, to advise Investors Bank with respect to the BOP
market area, deposit and lending activities and customer relationships.
Investors Bank shall maintain the Advisory Board for a period of no less than
three years. The annual compensation and duties of the Advisory Board are set
forth in ISBC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 7.7.6.

7.7.7 Investors Bank and BOP agree to jointly establish a retention bonus pool
to be paid to certain designated BOP employees, with such recipients, amount
of payments and timing of payments to be agreed to in writing by the parties
no later than 45 days following the date of this Agreement. Such payments
shall be made to the applicable individuals if they are still employed by one
of the parties upon their designated "work through" date as set forth in the
written retention bonus pool agreement. The parties reserve the right to amend
the retention bonus pool agreement from time to time, by a mutual written
agreement. The aggregate amount of such retention bonuses payable under the
Retention Bonus Pool Agreement is set forth in ISBC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 7.7.7.

 

7.7.8 ISBC and Investors Bank shall use their best efforts to cause the
Investors Charitable Foundation, from time to time and over a period of no
more than three years following the Effective Time, to make contributions of
no less than $1,000,000 in the aggregate to qualifying charitable and
community organizations in the communities presently served by BOP.

 



61 7.8. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

 

7.8.1. ISBC shall maintain, or shall cause Investors Bank to maintain, in
effect for six years following the Effective Time, the current directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance policies maintained by BOP (provided, that ISBC
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions which are not materially less favorable) with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "Tail Insurance Coverage");
provided, however, that in no event shall ISBC be required to expend pursuant
to this Section 7.8.1 more than 200% of the annual cost currently expended by
BOP with respect to Tail Insurance Coverage (the "Maximum Amount"); _provided,
further,_ that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, ISBC shall
maintain the most advantageous policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In connection
with the foregoing, BOP agrees in order for ISBC to fulfill its agreement
to provide directors and officers liability insurance policies for six years
to provide such insurer or substitute insurer with such representations as
such insurer may request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims.
BOP will directly involve ISBC in the negotiation of the Tail Insurance
Coverage as well as with respect to the negotiations of the renewal of BOPÂ’s
current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance policy.

 

7.8.2. In addition to Section 7.8.1, from and after the Effective Time,
Investors Bank shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is
now, or who has been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before
the Effective Time, an officer or director of BOP or a BOP Subsidiary (the
"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written
consent of Investors Bank, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative (each
a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a
party or witness in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of
the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of BOP or
a BOP Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising,
existing or occurring before the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), to the fullest extent as
would have been permitted by BOP under the New Jersey Banking Law and under
BOPÂ’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Investors Bank shall pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding
to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by New Jersey
Banking Law (to the extent not prohibited by federal law) upon receipt of an
undertaking to repay such advance payments if the Indemnified Party shall be
adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to indemnification in the manner
set forth below. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 7.8.2 upon learning of any Claim, shall notify Investors Bank
(but the failure so to notify Investors Bank shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have under this Section 7.8.2, except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices Investors Bank) and shall deliver to
Investors Bank the undertaking 

 



62  referred to in the previous sentence. In the event of any such Claim
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time) (1) Investors Bank shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof (in which event the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter) and upon such
assumption Investors Bank shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that
if Investors Bank elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there
are or may be (whether or not any have yet actually arisen) issues which
raise conflicts of interest between Investors Bank and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them, and Investors Bank shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) except to the extent otherwise
required due to conflicts of interest, Investors Bank shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties whose reasonable fees and expenses shall be paid promptly
as statements are received unless there is a conflict of interest that
necessitates more than one law firm, and (3) Investors Bank shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

7.8.3. The obligations of Investors Bank provided under this Section 7.8 are
intended to be enforceable against Investors Bank directly by the Indemnified
Parties and shall be binding on all respective successors and permitted
assigns of Investors Bank. Investors Bank shall pay all reasonable costs,
including attorneysÂ’ fees, as incurred and in advance of the final disposition
of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by any Indemnified
Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
for in this Section 7.8 to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law;
however such payment of costs should be immediately reimbursed to Investors
Bank by such Indemnified Party if they are not successful enforcing the
indemnity or other obligations provided for in this Section 7.8. The rights of
each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights
such Indemnified Party may have under applicable law.

7.9. _Stock Listing._

 

ISBC agrees to list on the Nasdaq (or such other national securities exchange
on which the shares of the ISBC Common Stock shall be listed as of the
Closing Date), subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of ISBC
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

7.10. _Stock and Cash Reserve._

ISBC agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares
of ISBC Common Stock and to maintain sufficient liquid accounts or borrowing
capacity to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

 



63 ARTICLE VIII

 

REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS

 

8.1. _Meeting of Stockholders_ _; Proxy Statement-Prospectus; Merger
Registration Statement_

 

8.1.1. BOP will as promptly as practicable after the Merger Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC, take all steps necessary to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, which
may be an annual meeting, for the purpose of considering this Agreement and
the Merger, and for such other purposes as may be, in BOPÂ’s reasonable
judgment, necessary or desirable (the "BOP Stockholders Meeting"). BOP agrees
that its obligations pursuant to this Section 8.1 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to BOP of
any Acquisition Proposal or by any Change of Recommendation (as defined
below). Subject to Section 6.10.4, BOP shall, (i) through BOPÂ’s Board of
Directors, recommend to its stockholders approval and adoption of this
Agreement (the "BOP Recommendation"), (ii) include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus (as defined below) for such BOP Stockholders
Meeting and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the BOP
Stockholders a vote approving and adopting this Agreement, including
utilizing the services of a professional proxy soliciting firm mutually
agreeable to ISBC and BOP. BOP shall adjourn or postpone the BOP Stockholders
Meeting, and further solicit proxies, if, as of the time for which such
meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of BOP Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of
such meeting BOP has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares necessary to obtain stockholder approval. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with its terms, the BOP Stockholders Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of BOP for the purpose of
voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated
hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve BOP of such
obligation.

8.1.2. For the purposes (x) of registering ISBC Common Stock to be offered to
holders of BOP Common Stock in connection with the Merger with the SEC under
the Securities Act and (y) of holding the BOP Stockholders Meeting, ISBC shall
draft and prepare, and BOP shall cooperate in the preparation of, the Merger
Registration Statement, including a proxy statement and prospectus satisfying
all applicable requirements of applicable state securities and banking laws,
and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder (such proxy statement/prospectus in the form mailed by BOP to the
BOP stockholders, together with any and all amendments or supplements thereto,
being herein referred to as the "Proxy Statement-Prospectus"). ISBC shall
provide BOP and its counsel with appropriate opportunity to review and comment
on the Proxy Statement-Prospectus prior to the time it is initially filed with
the SEC or any amendments are filed with the SEC. ISBC shall file the
Merger Registration Statement, including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, with
the SEC. Each of ISBC and BOP shall use their best efforts to have the Merger
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and BOP shall thereafter promptly
mail the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its stockholders. ISBC shall also use
its best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and BOP shall furnish all information concerning BOP and the
holders of BOP Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action.

 



64 8.1.3. ISBC shall, as soon as is practicable, file the Merger Registration
Statement with the SEC under the Securities Act in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that time
is of the essence in connection with the preparation and filing of the Merger
Registration Statement. ISBC will advise BOP promptly after ISBC receives
notice of the time when the Merger Registration Statement has become effective
or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop
order or the suspension of the qualifications of the shares of ISBC Common
Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger Registration Statement, or the
initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request
by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Merger Registration
Statement, or for additional information, and ISBC will provide BOP with as
many copies of such Merger Registration Statement and all amendments thereto
promptly upon the filing thereof as BOP may reasonably request.

 

8.1.4. BOP and ISBC shall promptly notify the other party if at any time it
becomes aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Merger Registration
Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. In such event, BOP shall cooperate with ISBC in the
preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Proxy Statement-Prospectus
that corrects such misstatement or omission, and ISBC shall file an amended
Merger Registration Statement with the SEC, and BOP shall mail a Proxy
Statement-Prospectus to BOPÂ’s stockholders.

 

8.2. _Regulatory Approvals._

 

The Parties will cooperate with each other and use best efforts to promptly
prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary filings and to
obtain all necessary permits, consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations
of, the Bank Regulators and any other Governmental Entities necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and ISBC and
Investors Bank will make all necessary filings in respect of the required
Regulatory Approvals as promptly as practicable after the date hereof;
_provided, however,_ that in no event shall ISBC or Investors Bank be required
to agree to any prohibition, limitation, or other requirement of any Bank
Regulator that would (a) prohibit or materially limit the ownership or
operation by ISBC or Investors Bank of all or any material portion of the
business or assets of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary, (b) compel ISBC or Investors
Bank to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the
business or assets of BOP or any BOP Subsidiary, (c) impose a material
compliance burden, penalty or obligation on ISBC or Investors Bank resulting
from noncompliance by BOP with its regulatory obligations; or (d) otherwise
materially impair the value of BOP and the BOP Subsidiaries (any such
requirement alone, or more than one such requirement together, a "Burdensome
Condition"). The Parties will furnish each other and each otherÂ’s counsel
with all information concerning themselves, their subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be necessary or
advisable in connection with any application, petition or any other statement
or application made to any Bank Regulator or Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
BOP shall have the right to review, and to the 

 



65  extent practicable to consult with ISBC and Investors Bank on, the
information which appears in any filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Bank Regulator or any
Governmental Entity. ISBC shall give BOP and its counsel the opportunity to
review, and to the extent practicable to consult with ISBC and Investors Bank
on, each filing prior to its being filed with a Bank Regulator and shall give
BOP and its counsel the opportunity to review all regulatory filings,
amendments and supplements to such filings and all responses to requests for
additional information and replies to comments prior to their being filed
with, or sent to, a Bank Regulator.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

11.1. _Termination._

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date,
whether before or after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of BOP:

 

11.1.1. At any time by the mutual written agreement of ISBC and BOP;

 

11.1.2. By either party (provided, that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach by its nature cannot be cured prior to the
Termination Date or shall not have been cured within 30 days after written
notice of such breach by the terminating party to the other party; provided,
however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11.1.2 unless the breach of representation or
warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the terminating
party not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section
9.2.1 (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by BOP) or
Section 9.3.1 (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by ISBC
or Investors Bank);

11.1.3. By either party (provided, that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein) if there shall have been a material failure to perform or
comply with any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on
the part of the other party, which failure by its nature cannot be cured prior
to the Termination Date or shall not have been cured within 30 days after
written notice of such failure by the terminating party to the other party;
provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.3 unless the breach of covenant or
agreement, together with all other such breaches, would entitle
the terminating party not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
under Section 9.2.2 (in the case of a breach of covenant by BOP) or Section
9.3.2 (in the case of a breach of covenant by ISBC or Investors Bank);

 

11.1.4. At the election of either party, if the Closing shall not have
occurred by the Termination Date, or such later date as shall have been
agreed to in writing by ISBC and BOP; provided, that no party may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.4 if the failure of the Closing
to have occurred on or before said date was due to such partyÂ’s material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
in this Agreement;

11.1.5. By either party, if the stockholders of BOP shall have voted at the
BOP Stockholders Meeting (as it may be adjourned and reconvened) and such vote
shall not have been sufficient to approve the Merger or this Agreement;

 

11.1.6. By either party if (i) final action has been taken by a Bank Regulator
whose approval is required in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, which final action (x) has become
nonappealable and (y) does not approve this

 



69  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Bank Regulator
whose approval or nonobjection is required in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby has stated in writing that it will
not issue the required approval or nonobjection, or (iii) any court of
competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority shall have issued an
order, decree, ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and nonappealable;

 

11.1.7. By the Board of Directors of either party (provided, that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) in
the event that any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such
party to consummate the Merger cannot be satisfied or fulfilled by the date
specified in Section 11.1.4 of this Agreement.

11.1.8. By ISBC and Investors Bank, (i) if BOP shall have materially breached
its obligations under Section 6.10 or 8.1.1 of this Agreement or (ii) if the
BOP Board does not publicly recommend in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus for
the BOP Stockholders Meeting that the BOP Stockholders approve and adopt this
Agreement or if, after making the BOP Recommendation in the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus for the BOP Stockholders Meeting, the BOP Board makes a BOP
Subsequent Determination.

11.1.9. By ISBC and Investors Bank if BOP has received a Superior Proposal
and BOP has entered into an acquisition agreement with respect to the Superior
Proposal, withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement, has failed to make
such recommendation or has modified or qualified its recommendation in a
manner adverse to ISBC.

11.1.10. By the BOP Board if BOP has received a Superior Proposal and the BOP
Board has made a determination to accept such Superior Proposal.

11.1.11. By BOP, if the BOP Board so determines by a majority vote of the
members of its entire Board, at any time during the five business day period
commencing on the Determination Date, such termination to be effective on the
10th business day following such Determination Date, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:

(i) The ISBC Market Value is less than the Initial ISBC Market Value
multiplied by 0.80; and

(ii) (a) the number obtained by dividing the ISBC Market Value by the Initial
ISBC Market Value ("ISBC Ratio") shall be less than (b) the Index Ratio minus
0.20;

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If BOP elects to exercise
its termination right pursuant to this Section 11.1.11, it shall give prompt
written notice thereof to ISBC. During the five business day period commencing
with its receipt of such notice, ISBC shall have the option to increase
the consideration to be received by the holders of BOP Common Stock hereunder
by adjusting the Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of: (i) a quotient, the
numerator of which is equal to the product of the Initial ISBC Market Value,
the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), and the Index Ratio minus 0.20, and
the denominator of which is equal to ISBC Market Value; or (ii) the quotient
determined by dividing the Initial ISBC Market Value by the ISBC Market Value,
and multiplying the quotient by the product of the Exchange Ratio (as then in
effect) and

 



70  0.80. If ISBC so elects, it shall give, within such five business-day
period, written notice to BOP of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio,
whereupon no termination shall be deemed to have occurred pursuant to this
Section 11.1.11 and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio and the Merger
Consideration shall have been so modified).

 

For purposes of this Section 11.1.11, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:

 

"Determination Date" shall mean the first date on which all Regulatory
Approvals necessary for consummation of the Mergers have been received
(disregarding any waiting period).

"Final Index Price" means the average of the daily closing value of the Index
for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination
Date.

"Initial Index Price" means the closing value of the Index on the trading day
immediately preceding the execution of this Agreement.

"Index" means the KBW Regional Bank Index.

"Index Ratio" shall be the Final Index Price divided by the Initial Index
Price.

 

"Initial ISBC Market Value" means $11.68, adjusted if applicable as indicated
in the last sentence of Section 11.1.11.

 

"ISBC Market Value" shall be the average of the daily closing sales prices of
a share of ISBC Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq for the five
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date.

If ISBC declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the
prices of ISBC Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes
of applying this Section 11.1.11.

11.2. _Effect of Termination._

 

11.2.1. In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to any
provision of Section 11.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no further force, except that the provisions of Sections 11.2, 12.1,
12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.9, 12.10, and any other Section which, by its
terms, relates to post-termination rights or obligations, shall survive such
termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect.

11.2.2. If this Agreement is terminated, expenses and damages of the parties
hereto shall be determined as follows:

(A) Except as provided below, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated

 



71  hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense; _provided_ , that
the costs and expenses of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement-Prospectus
and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger
Registration Statement shall be borne equally by ISBC and BOP.

(B) In the event of a termination of this Agreement because of a willful
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, the breaching party shall remain liable for any and all
damages, costs and expenses, including all reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees,
sustained or incurred by the non-breaching party as a result thereof or in
connection therewith or with respect to the enforcement of its rights
hereunder. Moreover, no party shall be relieved of liability for fraud.

 

(C) As a condition of ISBCÂ’s willingness, and in order to induce ISBC to enter
into this Agreement, and to reimburse ISBC for incurring the costs and
expenses related to entering into this Agreement and consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, BOP hereby agrees to pay ISBC,
and ISBC shall be entitled to payment of, a fee of $6.4 million (the
"Fee"), within three business days after written demand for payment is made
by ISBC, following the occurrence of any of the events set forth below:

 

(i) BOP terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1.10 or ISBC and
Investors Bank terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1.8 or 11.1.9;
or

(ii) The entering into a definitive agreement by BOP relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of an Acquisition Proposal involving
BOP within nine months after the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the
termination of the Agreement by ISBC and Investors Bank pursuant to Section
11.1.2 or 11.1.3 because of a willful breach by BOP or any BOP Subsidiary
after the occurrence of such Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) the failure of the
stockholders of BOP to approve this Agreement after the occurrence of such
Acquisition Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal had been made directly to
BOPÂ’s stockholders or otherwise publicly disclosed or known by BOPÂ’s
stockholders prior to the taking of the vote at the BOP Stockholders Meeting
or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

 

(D) The right to receive payment of the Fee under Section 11.2.2(C) will
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of ISBC and Investors Bank against
BOP and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors with
respect to a termination listed under Section 11.2.2(C)(i) or (ii). Any Fee
paid under Section 11.2.2(C) will be reduced dollar-for-dollar by any
amounts previously received by ISBC and/or Investors Bank pursuant to Section
11.2.2(B).

(E) ISBC shall be reimbursed by BOP for all fees, costs and other expenses
incurred by ISBC in connection with enforcing its right to the Fee.

11.3. _Amendment, Extension and Waiver._

 

Subject to applicable law, at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether
before or after approval thereof by the stockholders of BOP), the parties
hereto by action of their respective Boards of Directors, may (a) amend this
Agreement, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of any other party hereto, (c) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, or

 



72  (d) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained

be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this
Agreement which reduces the amount or value, or changes the form of, the
Merger Consideration to be delivered to BOPÂ’s stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party, but such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article XI may only be effected upon a vote of a
majority of the entire Board of Directors of the terminating party.

12.5. _Parties in Interest._

 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided,
however, that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto without the prior
written consent of the other party. Except for the provisions of Article
III and Sections 7.7.6, 7.8 and this 12.5, following the Effective Time,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
person, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of
this Agreement.

 

12.6. _Complete Agreement._

 

This Agreement, including the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules hereto and the
documents and other writings referred to herein or therein or delivered
pursuant hereto, and the Confidentiality Agreements referred to in Section
12.1, contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with
respect to its subject matter. There are no restrictions, agreements,
promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings between the parties other
than those expressly set forth herein or therein. This Agreement supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement referred to in Section 12.1 hereof) between the parties, both
written and oral, with respect to its subject matter.

12.7. _Counterparts._

 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and each of which shall be deemed an
original. A facsimile copy or electronic transmission of a signature page
shall be deemed to be an original signature page.

 



75 12.8. _Severability._

 

In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement and the parties shall
use their reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable
provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and intents of
this Agreement.

12.9. _Governing Law._

 

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Delaware, without giving
effect to its principles of conflicts of laws.

 

12.10. _Interpretation._

 

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The recitals hereto constitute an integral part of this
Agreement. References to Sections include subsections, which are part of the
related Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section 5.5.1" would be part
of "Section 5.5" and references to "Section 5.5" would also refer to material
contained in the subsection described as "Section 5.5.1"). The table of
contents, index and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date
hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires,
shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the Recitals to this
Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

12.11. _Specific Performance; Venue._

 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the provisions contained in this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each party agrees that it will not seek and will agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of a bond in connection with the
other partyÂ’s seeking or obtaining such injunctive relief. In addition, each
of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or

 



76  defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware. In the event it
is determined that the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware does not have
jurisdiction with respect to any dispute arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated, all reference in this Section 12.11 to the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware shall be deemed to include any other court
located in the State of Delaware solely with respect to such claim. 

12.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_ __

 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY COURSE OF
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, VERBAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT OR ACTION OF ANY PARTY
HERETO.

 



77 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, ISBC, Investors Bank and BOP have caused this Agreement to
be executed by their duly authorized officers as of the date first set forth
above.
