and among aQuantive, Inc., a Washington corporation ("Parent"), Artist Merger
Sub, Inc., a Utah corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("Purchaser"), and SBI HOLDINGS INC., a Utah corporation ("SBI"). Reference is
made to Article X for the definitions of certain terms used in this
Agreement.



In consideration of the mutual agreements contained in this Agreement, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the value, receipt and sufficiency
of which are acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:



ARTICLE I

THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time SBI will be merged with Purchaser (the "Merger") in
accordance with the provisions of the Revised Business Corporation Act of the
State of Utah (the "Utah Act"). Following the Merger, SBI will continue as
the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and the separate
corporate existence of Purchaser will cease. SBI and Purchaser are sometimes
referred to collectively as the "Constituent Corporations."



1.2 _The Closing_. Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, the closing of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be
specified by the parties that is no later than the third business
day following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Parr Waddoups Brown Gee and
Loveless, 185 South State Street, Suite 1300, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111,
unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties.



1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date (or on such other date as the parties may
agree), SBI and Purchaser will file with the Utah Division of Corporations and
Commercial Code (the "Utah Division") appropriate articles of merger (the
"Articles of Merger") and make all other filings or recordings required by the
Utah Act in connection with the Merger. The Merger will be consummated on the
later of the date on which the Articles of Merger have been filed with the
Utah Division or such time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in
the Articles of Merger. The time the Merger becomes effective in accordance
with the Utah Act is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time."



1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and Section 16-10a-1106 of the Utah Act. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation will succeed to all the properties, rights, privileges, powers,
franchises and assets of the Constituent Corporations, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Constituent Corporations will become debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



1.5 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of Purchaser (as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time) will become the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their
respective terms and the Utah Act. 



1.6 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and the officers of Purchaser at
the Effective Time will be the initial directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation and will hold office from the Effective Time in accordance with
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



 

1 1.7 _Conversion of Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of SBI, Parent or Purchaser:



1.7.1 _Merger Consideration_. The "Aggregate Merger Consideration" shall,
subject to Section 1.7.1.2, consist of (i) the aggregate cash sum $85,000,000,
less the cash amount paid to holders of SBI Options as set forth in Section
1.8 below (including amounts deducted and withheld and deemed paid pursuant
to Section 2.9), less any adjustment required pursuant to Section 8.3 and
subject to further adjustment pursuant to Section 1.7.2 (the "Cash
Consideration"), plus (ii) Convertible Notes of Parent in the aggregate
principal amount of $75,000,000 (the "Note Consideration"). Each Convertible
Note shall be issued under a Convertible Note Agreement substantially in the
form of Exhibit A hereto and will be substantially in the form of Exhibit B
to such Convertible Note Agreement, and have the interest rate, term and
conversion rights as set forth therein. The "Per Share Merger Consideration"
shall consist of the Aggregate Merger Consideration divided by the
aggregate number of SBI Shares (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 1.7.3) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Each SBI Common Share and each SBI Series B Share (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.7.3 and any Dissenting
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into the right to receive Per Share Merger Consideration as follows:



1.7.1.1 _Merger Consideration to SBI Series B Shares and SBI Common Shares_.
Each SBI Common Share and Series B Share (other than SBI Common Shares and
Series B Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.7.3 and any
Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be converted into the right to receive cash and Convertible Notes
in an aggregate amount equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration. The
Convertible Notes shall be allocated among the SBI Common Shares and Series B
Shares on a pro rata basis. 



1.7.1.2 _No Fractional Convertible Notes_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall not be obligated to deliver any Convertible Notes that have a
principal amount of less than $30,000 (a "Fractional Convertible Note"). and
any holder of SBI Common or Series B Shares that would otherwise be entitled
to receive a Fractional Convertible Note will receive cash equal to the
principal amount of the Convertible Note such holder of SBI Shares would
otherwise be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of such shareholders
right to receive a fractional Convertible Note. In addition, no Convertible
Note shall be issued to a holder of SBI Shares in integral multiples of less
than $1,000; instead, each such Convertible Note shall be rounded to
the nearest $1,000 (with $500 being rounded up), with the aggregate Cash
Consideration that such holder of SBI Shares is entitled to receive being
appropriately reduced where the principal amount of the Convertible Note is
rounded up and appropriately increased where the principal amount of
Convertible Note is rounded down, such that the total Aggregate Merger
Consideration such SBI Holder receives does not change as a result of the
rounding.



1.7.1.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time and
upon written notice to SBI, Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to
substitute cash for the Note Consideration, in which case:



(i) the "Aggregate Merger Consideration" shall consist of the aggregate cash
sum $160,000,000, less the cash amount paid to holders of SBI Options as set
forth in Section 1.8 below (including amounts deducted and withheld and deemed
paid pursuant to Section 2.9), less any adjustment required pursuant to
Section 8.3, and subject to further adjustment pursuant to Section 1.7.2;
and 



 

2 (ii) Each SBI Common Share and each SBI Series B Share (other than SBI Common
Shares and SBI Series B Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
1.7.3 and any Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration.



1.7.2 _Closing Adjustment to Cash Consideration_.



1.7.2.1 _Closing Balance Sheet_. SBI shall prepare and deliver to Parent a
balance sheet dated as of the Closing Date, with the same itemized categories
and prepared on the same basis as the SBI Most Recent Balance Sheet, which in
the reasonable good-faith estimate of SBI will properly reflect the assets
and liabilities of SBI as of the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
any Tax liability associated with the disposition of the Distribution Assets,
based on a bona fide third party appraisal (the "Appraisal") of the
Distribution Assets (other than those Distribution Assets consisting solely of
liabilities, which shall be valued by the Board of Directors of SBI in good
faith), in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall clearly identify
all Third Party Debt (as defined below).



1.7.2.2 _Third Party Debt_. The aggregate Cash Consideration and the Option
Base Amount (as defined in Section 1.8 below) shall each be reduced by the
amount of all Third Party Debt. "Third Party Debt" shall mean all amounts owed
by SBI as of the Closing Date under the IRS Liability, and any promissory
note, loan, line of credit, interest-bearing obligation, or capitalized
lease. 



1.7.2.3 _Net Working Capital_. The aggregate Cash Consideration (or the
Aggregate Merger Consideration in the event cash is substituted for
Convertible Notes pursuant to Section 1.7.1.3) and the Option Base Amount
shall each be reduced by the dollar amount by which the Net Working Capital
Amount as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet is less than $13,100,000 and
the aggregate Cash Consideration (or the Aggregate Merger Consideration in the
event cash is substituted for Convertible Notes pursuant to Section 1.7.1.3)
and the Option Base Amount shall be increased by the dollar amount by which
the Net Working Capital Amount is more than $14,100,000. "Net Working Capital
Amount" means (i) the amount of SBIs current assets as reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet less (ii) the amount of SBIs current liabilities as
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet. For purposes of calculating the Net
Working Capital Amount, (x) SBIs current liabilities shall not include the
current portion of SBIs outstanding Third Party Debt, the amount of the
severance obligations to be paid by Parent pursuant to Section 6.8, the amount
of transaction fees, completion bonuses and expenses deducted from the
aggregate Cash Consideration (or the Aggregate Merger Consideration in the
event cash is substituted for Convertible Notes pursuant to Section 1.7.1.3)
pursuant to Section 8.3, the costs related to the continuation of insurance
policies as contemplated pursuant to Section 6.5.3 and the amount of any
obligation to a holder of Dissenting Shares, and (y) SBIs current assets
shall include the amount of long term deposits reflected on the Closing
Balance Sheet as of the Closing Date.



1.7.2.4. _Final Closing Balance Sheet_. (a)As soon as practicable, but in any
event within 60 calendar days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare
(or cause to be prepared under its direction) and deliver to the SBI
Representative (A) an unaudited balance sheet of SBI (the "Final Closing
Balance Sheet") as of the Closing Date, and (B) a certificate based on such
Final Closing Balance Sheet setting forth Parents calculation of the Net
Working Capital Amount. The Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with historical preparation
of the SBI Financial Statements, except that it shall not contain the
footnotes required thereby.



(b) In the event that the Net Working Capital Amount as reflected on the Final
Closing Balance Sheet is less than both (i) $13,100,000 and (ii) the
amount set forth on the Closing



 

3 Balance Sheet, then, subject to subparagraph (d) below, Parent shall be
entitled to immediately deduct from the Indemnity Escrow, without regard to
the Threshold, as a downward adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration,
the dollar amount equal to the difference between the Net Working Capital
Amount as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital
Amount as reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet.



(c) In the event that the Net Working Capital Amount as reflected on the Final
Closing Balance Sheet is greater than both (i) $14,100,000 and (ii) the amount
set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet, then Parent shall pay to the holders
of SBI Shares that were the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time,
as an upward adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration, an amount in
cash equal to the difference between the Net Working Capital Amount as
reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital
Amount as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet. Such amount shall be paid to
the holders of the SBI Shares that were holders immediately prior to the
Effective Time pro rata based on such holders portion of the total amount of
Aggregate Merger Consideration paid to all holders of SBI Shares in the Merger
at the Effective Time.



(d) The SBI Representative may dispute any amounts reflected on the Final
Closing Balance Sheet; provided, however, that the SBI Representative shall
have notified Parent in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount
thereof in dispute, the calculation of the disputed amount and setting forth,
in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 30 calendar days of
the SBI Representatives receipt of the Final Closing Balance Sheet. The SBI
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Net
Working Capital Amount. In the event of such a dispute, the SBI
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to reconcile their
differences. If the SBI Representative and Parent are unable to reach a
resolution within 30 calendar days after receipt by Parent of the SBI
Representatives written notice of dispute, the SBI Representative and
Shareholder shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to KPMG
LLP (or such other independent accounting firm of national reputation as
may be mutually acceptable to Parent and the SBI Representative) (the _"_
Independent Accounting Firm _"_ ), which shall, within 60 calendar days of
such submission, determine and report to Parent and the SBI Representative
upon such remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding
and conclusive on Parent and the SBI Representative. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Parent;
provided however, that if the Independent Accounting Firm shall determine
that the net total variance of all items disputed by the SBI Representative
varies by less than 10% of the amount calculated by Parent, then such fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall paid out of the
Indemnity Escrow.



1.7.3 _Cancellation of SBI Shares Held by Parent and Purchaser_. Each SBI
Share owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by SBI, Parent, Purchaser
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, including without limitation, any
such shares held as treasury stock of SBI, will be canceled and extinguished
and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. For purposes of
this section, SBI Shares owned beneficially or held of record by any plan,
program or arrangement sponsored or maintained for the benefit of any current
or former employee of SBI, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, will not be deemed to be held by SBI, Parent, Purchaser or any
such Subsidiary, regardless of whether SBI, Parent, Purchaser or any such
Subsidiary has the power, directly or indirectly, to vote or control the
disposition of such shares.



1.7.4 _Conversion of Shares of Purchaser._ Each issued and outstanding share
of capital stock of Purchaser shall be converted into one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.



1.8 _Cancellation of SBI Options_. In accordance with the SBI Option Plan
and/or the applicable SBI Option Agreements and an agreement between SBI and
the holder of the warrants that are included in the



 

4 SBI Options to be entered into as provided in Section 6.6.3, each SBI Option
that is unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
will, without any further action on the part of the holder thereof (except
with respect to such warrants, which SBI shall cause to be cancelled at the
Effective Time consistent with the provisions of 6.6.3), fully vest, be
canceled, and represent only the right to receive from Parent an amount,
payable in cash only, equal to the product of (A) the number of SBI Shares
subject to the SBI Option multiplied by (B) the Option Per Share Amount (as
defined below) less the exercise price, as may be adjusted by the Board of
Directors of SBI, for each SBI Share purchasable pursuant to such SBI Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Option Spread Payment"), and all
other rights of a holder associated with SBI Options shall be terminated and
canceled. The Option Per Share Amount shall be determined by dividing
$160,000,000 plus the aggregate exercise prices of all In The Money Options
(the "Option Base Amount"), less any adjustment required pursuant to Section
8.3 and as further adjusted pursuant to Section 1.7.2 (other than the
adjustment set forth in 1.7.2.4), by the Fully Diluted Common Stock Number.
The "Fully Diluted Common Stock Number" shall mean the total number of shares
of SBI Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on a fully
diluted basis, including (x) the assumed exercise of all outstanding In The
Money Options (but excluding all other SBI Options that are not In the Money
Options) and (y) the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible
securities (including, without limitation, the outstanding shares of SBI
Preferred Stock) and notes convertible into SBI Shares. The "In The Money
Options" shall mean all outstanding rights, warrants or options, vested or
unvested, to acquire SBI Shares, regardless of restrictions on exercise or
conversion, where the option exercise price is $1.10 per share or less. As of
the Effective Time, all SBI Options that are not In the Money Options shall
be cancelled and shall not be entitled to receive any Option Spread Payment or
other consideration as a result of the Merger.



1.9 _Funding of Indemnity Escrow_. At the Closing, Parent shall deduct the
full amount of the Holdback, consisting of Cash Consideration in the amount
of $500,000 and Convertible Notes in the principal amount of $10,200,000
(subject to Purchasers right to substitute cash as provided is Section
1.7.1.3), from the Aggregate Merger Consideration and deliver the Holdback to
the Indemnity Escrow, as provided in Section 8.5.2.2. Such amount shall be
withheld, on a pro rata basis, from the Cash Consideration and Note
Consideration otherwise deliverable to the SBI Stockholders on delivery of
their SBI Stock Certificates in accordance with Section 2.1.



ARTICLE II 

PAYMENT



2.1 _Surrender of SBI Stock Certificates_. From and after the Effective Time,
each holder of a stock certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented an outstanding SBI Share (a "SBI Stock Certificate") will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, upon surrender thereof to the Paying
Agent, the Per Share Merger Consideration into which SBI Shares evidenced by
such SBI Stock Certificate were converted pursuant to the Merger. No interest
will be payable on the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to any holder
of a SBI Stock Certificate irrespective of the time at which such SBI Stock
Certificate is surrendered for exchange.



2.2 _Paying Agent; SBI Stock Certificate Surrender Procedures_.



2.2.1 _Paying Agent_. On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
designate (with the prior approval of SBI) and enter into an agreement with an
institution or trust company to act as paying agent for the Merger
Consideration (the "Paying Agent").



2.2.2 _Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, an amount in cash and
Convertible Notes sufficient to provide all funds necessary for the Paying
Agent to make payment of the Merger Consideration (the "Payment Fund").
Pending

 



 

5 payment of the cash portion of such funds to the holders of SBI Stock
Certificates, the cash portion of the Payment Fund will be held and may be
invested by the Paying Agent as Parent directs (so long as such directions do
not impair the rights of holders of SBI Shares) in: (i) the direct obligations
of the United States for which the full faith and credit of the United States
is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest; (ii)
commercial paper maturing not more than 270 days after the date of issue and
rated P-1 by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or A-1 by Standard and
Poors Corporation, (iii) certificates of deposit maturing not more than 270
days after the date of issue issued by, or in money market or demand deposit
accounts maintained at, a commercial banking institution, which is a member of
the Federal Reserve System and has a combined capital and surplus and
undivided profits of not less than $500,000,000; (iv) money market accounts
maintained with mutual funds having assets in excess of $2,500,000,000; and
(v) tax exempt securities rated A or better by Moodys or A+ or better by
Standard and Poors. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee, in
Parents sole discretion. Parent will promptly replace any monies lost
through any investment made pursuant to this Section 2.2.2.



2.2.3 _Transmittals_. Not later than 10 days prior to the Closing, SBI will
mail to each record holder of a SBI Stock Certificate and each holder of an
SBI Option that is an In the Money Option a letter of transmittal in a form
mutually agreeable to the parties, including instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of SBI Stock Certificate or SBI Option Agreement, as applicable,
for the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration or the aggregate Option
Spread Payment, as applicable, to which such holder is entitled. Upon the
surrender to the Paying Agent of a SBI Stock Certificate (or original copy of
the SBI Option Agreement in the case of holder of In The Money Options)
together with a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal and all
other documents and other materials required by the Paying Agent to be
delivered in connection therewith, following the Effective Time, the holder
will be entitled to receive the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration or
the aggregate Option Spread Payment, as applicable, into which the SBI Stock
Certificate (or SBI Option Agreement) so surrendered has been converted in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Until so surrendered, each
outstanding SBI Stock Certificate and each outstanding SBI Option will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence the right to receive the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration or
the aggregate Option Spread Payment, as applicable, into which SBI Shares
represented by such SBI Stock Certificate or SBI Option Agreement have been
converted in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.



2.3 _Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of SBI will be closed at the
Effective Time, and no transfer of any SBI Shares will thereafter be recorded
on any of the stock transfer books. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
any SBI Shares prior to the Effective Time that is not registered in the stock
transfer records of SBI at the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration into which such SBI Shares have been converted in the Merger
will be paid to the transferee in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.2 only if the SBI Stock Certificate is surrendered as provided in Section
2.2 and accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer (including evidence of payment of any applicable stock transfer
taxes).



2.4 _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and each holder of SBI Shares who has
not previously surrendered SBI Stock Certificates in accordance with the
provisions of this Article II will thereafter look only to Parent for
satisfaction of such holders claims for the Merger Consideration.



2.5 _Dissenters Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, SBI Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto
in writing and who has complied with all of the relevant provisions of



 

6 Section 16-10a-1301 et. seq. of the Utah Act regarding appraisal for such
shares ("Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted into a right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such Dissenting Shares under the
provisions of the Utah Act, will receive payment thereof from the Surviving
Corporation and such Dissenting Shares will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist. 



2.6 _Lost SBI Stock Certificates or SBI Option Agreements_. If any SBI Stock
Certificate or Option Agreement has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent)
of that fact by the person making such a claim, the Paying Agent will deliver
in exchange for the affidavit representing such lost, stolen or destroyed SBI
Stock Certificate or Option Agreement the Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.2 or Option Spread Payment pursuant to Section 1.8.



2.7 _No Rights as Stockholder_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of SBI Stock Certificates will cease to have any rights as a stockholder of
the Surviving Corporation except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Laws, and Parent will be entitled to treat each SBI
Stock Certificate that has not yet been surrendered for exchange solely as
evidence of the right to receive the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
to which such holder is entitled.



 

2.8 _Payments With Respect to Unexchanged Convertible Notes_. All Convertible
Notes to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever an interest, dividend or
other payment is made by Parent in respect thereof, the record date for which
is at or after the Effective Time, that payment shall include interest,
dividends or other payments in respect of all Convertible Notes issuable
pursuant to this Agreement commencing as of the Effective Date. However, no
such payments in respect of the Convertible Notes shall be paid to any holder
of any unsurrendered SBI Stock Certificate until such certificate is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article II.



2.9 _Withholding_. Parent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Per
Share Merger Consideration and the Option Spread Payment, as applicable,
otherwise payable to any former holder of SBI Shares or SBI Options all
amounts required by Law to be deducted or withheld therefrom. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of SBI Shares or SBI Options in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.



2.10 _Escheat_. Neither Parent, Purchaser nor SBI will be liable to any former
holder of SBI Shares or SBI Options for any portion of the Per Share Merger
Consideration and the Option Spread Payment delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. In the
event any SBI Stock Certificate or Option Agreement has not been surrendered
for the Merger Consideration prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, or prior to such earlier date as of which such SBI Stock
Certificate or Option Agreement or the Per Share Merger Consideration or Per
Share Option Spread Payment payable upon the surrender thereof would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, then the Per
Share Merger Consideration or Option Spread Payment otherwise payable upon the
surrender of such SBI Stock Certificate or Option Agreement will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all rights, interests and adverse claims of any
person.

with the SEC required to be filed by it after January 1, 2002 and prior to the

SEC Documents"). Each Parent SEC Document, as of its filing date (or if

material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, and
the Exchange Act, as the case may be. No Parent SEC Document filed pursuant
to the Exchange Act, as of its filing date (or if amended, as of the date of
its last amendment), contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. No Parent SEC Document filed pursuant to the Securities Act,
as of the date such document or amendment became effective (or if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of its last amendment or supplement), contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading. Parent has no material undisclosed or off-balance sheet
liabilities. No Subsidiary of Parent is required to file any forms, reports,

financial statements (collectively the "Parent Financial Statements"): (i)
the audited consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries and the
related consolidated statement of operations, stockholders equity and cash
flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 (the "Parent Audited
Financial Statements"); and (ii) the



 

9 unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (the
"Parent Most Recent Balance Sheet"), and the related consolidated statement
of operations and cash flows as of and for the three months ending March 31,
2004 (collectively, the "Parent Most Recent Financial Statements"). The Parent
Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except for changes, if any, required by GAAP and disclosed
therein), and the statements of income present fairly in all material respects
the results of operations of Parent and the Subsidiaries included therein for
the respective periods covered and the balance sheets present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial condition of Parent and the
subsidiaries included therein as of their respective dates; provided
however that Parent Most Recent Financial Statements are subject to year-end
adjustments which will not be material.



3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in Section 3.7
of the _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ , since the date of the Parent Most Recent
Balance Sheet, Parent has conducted its business only in the ordinary course
(subject to matters related to this Agreement), and since the date of the
Parent Most Recent Balance Sheet, there has been no Material Adverse Effect on
Parents business.



3.8 _Broker s Fees_. Except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the _Parent
Disclosure Schedule_ , neither Parent nor any of its officers or directors
has employed any broker, finder or investment banker or incurred any liability
for any brokers fees, financial advisory fees, investment bankers or
finders fees in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



3.9  _Litigation_. There are no outstanding orders, judgments, injunctions,
awards or decrees of any court, governmental agency or authority or
arbitration tribunal by which Parent is bound, or to which any of its assets,
properties, securities or businesses is subject that are required to be
disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents that are not disclosed in the Parent SEC
Documents.



3.10 _Authorizations; Compliance with Laws_. Parent holds all authorizations,
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals required by
Governmental Entities for the lawful conduct of its business taken as a
whole, to own or hold under lease the properties and assets it owns or holds
under lease and to perform all of its obligations under the agreements to
which it is a party (the "Parent Permits"), except for such authorizations,
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals which the
failure to hold, taken together, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
Parent is in compliance with the terms of Parent Permits except where the
failure to be in such compliance will not, taken together, have a Material
Adverse Effect. To Parents Knowledge, except as set forth in Section 3.10 of
the _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ , as of the date of this Agreement, no
investigation or reviews by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent is
pending nor has any Governmental Entity notified Parent of an intention to
conduct the same nor do any facts exist which may give rise to such
an investigation or review.



3.11 _Full Disclosure_. No information provided by Parent to SBI in this
Agreement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements so made or information
so delivered not misleading.



3.12 _Customers_. Since December 31, 2003, there has not been a termination of
a material definitive agreement, and Parent has not received notice of such
termination, which, if final rule adopted by the SEC in release No. 33-8400
were in effect as of the date of such termination, would require Parent to
file a report with respect to such termination on Form 8-K or other
applicable SEC form under new Item 1.02 of Form 8-K.

equity incentive plans, and the general forms of SBI Option Agreements and,
except as noted on Section 4.2.2 of the _SBI Disclosure Schedule_ , the terms

obligations under its contracts; and (iii) each SBI Subsidiary is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which either the

reorganization, moratorium and the relief of debtors, and similar laws
affecting creditors rights and remedies generally, and (ii) the availability
of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies,
regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in

is a party (the "SBI Permits"), except for such authorizations, permits,
licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals which the failure to

compliance with the terms of the SBI Permits except where the failure to be in
such compliance will not, taken together, have a Material Adverse Effect. SBI
is and has been in compliance with all federal, state, local and foreign
laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, decrees and orders applicable to the
operation of its business, to its employees, or to its property, except where
the failure to comply would, individually or in the aggregate, not have

any asserted present or past unremedied material failure by SBI to comply with
any of such laws, rules, ordinances, decrees or orders.



4.13 _Absence of Defaults_. SBI is not in default under or in violation of any
provision of its Organizational Documents, or in material default or
violation of any Material Contract and, to the Knowledge of SBI, no event has

SBI, together with the policy number and coverage limits. SBI maintains
commercially reasonable levels of (a) insurance on its property (including
leased premises) that insures against loss or damage by fire or other casualty

the foregoing, provided that there has been no breach of this Section 5.1.7,
SBIs Board of Directors is not prohibited by this Section 5.1.7 from
considering, negotiating and providing information and disclosure in respect
of SBI if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with their outside legal and financial advisors, after appropriately
considering all relevant factors and after determining that the Board of
Directors of SBI must do so in order to discharge properly its fiduciary
duties) that an Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result
in, a "SBI Superior Proposal"; provided:



(A) SBI promptly (and in any event at least one business day prior to taking
any such action) notifies Parent orally and in writing of the identity of a
third party to whom it is providing information or with whom it is discussing
or negotiating;



(B) SBI receives from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement
containing limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and
oral information furnished to such person or group by or on behalf of SBI
which are no less favorable to SBI than the confidentiality agreement
executed with Parent;

third party, SBI furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the
extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by SBI to
Parent); and



(D) SBI does not submit such proposal for approval of the SBI Stockholders
unless the financing for such SBI Superior Proposal has been unconditionally
committed and such SBI Superior Proposal does not contain a due diligence
condition.



A "SBI Superior Proposal" means any acquisition proposal: (A) where (i) more
than 50% of the then outstanding SBI Shares would be transferred; (ii) an
amount of SBI Shares equal to more than 100% of the then outstanding SBI
Shares would be issued; (iii) the holders of SBI Shares would receive a number
of securities in a surviving entity representing less than 50% of the voting
power in such entity; or (iv) all or substantially all of the assets of
SBI would be transferred, and (B) on terms which the Board of Directors of
SBI determine in its good faith judgment (after consulting with advisors) to
be more favorable from a financial point of view to the SBI Stockholders than
the Merger.

 



5.1.8 _Shareholder Approval_. SBI will seek the approval at a special meeting
of shareholders or the written consent of the shareholders at the earliest
practicable date approving this Agreement, the Merger and related matters,
which approval will be recommended by the Board of Directors of SBI. SBIs
Board of Directors shall not withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to
withdraw, modify or qualify), in any manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser,
its recommendation to SBls shareholders of the approval of the Merger and
this Agreement (a "Change in Recommendation"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
provided that there has been no breach of Sections 5.1.7 and 5.1.8, SBls
Board of Directors is not prohibited by Sections 5.1.7 or 5.1.8 from effecting
a Change in Recommendation, provided that SBI has received an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal and SBls Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with their outside legal and financial
advisors, after appropriately considering all relevant factors and after
determining that the Board of Directors of SBI must do so in order to
discharge properly its fiduciary duties) that such Acquisition Proposal would,
if consummated in accordance with its terms (but taking into account the risk
of non-completion), result in a SBI Superior Proposal, and provided further
that SBI will not effect a Change in Recommendation relating to a SBI Superior
Proposal without first providing Parent not less than three business days
prior written notice of any such Change in Recommendation. If Parent and
Purchaser agree to amend the transaction contemplated by this agreement (an
"Amended Transaction" within such three business day period such that in the
good faith determination of the Board of Directors of SBI in the exercise of
their fiduciary duties, the Amended Transaction, if consummated, is reasonably
likely to result in a transaction which is as favorable from a financial point
of view to the stockholders of SBI as the SBI Superior Proposal (taking into
account all of the terms, conditions and aspects of such Amended Transaction
and SBI Superior Proposal), SBI will not effect the Change in Recommendation,
and will agree to the Amended Transaction. Nothing in this Section 5.1.8
shall (x) permit SBI to terminate this Agreement (except as specifically
provided in Article VIII) or (y) affect any other obligation of SBI under this
Agreement. SBI shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger or an SBI Superior Proposal. In
connection with the special meeting of shareholders or the written consent of
shares described herein, SBI shall provide to the SBI Stockholders all
disclosures required by Utah law in the manner proscribed by Utah law.



5.1.9 _Tax_. Except with respect to the IRS Liability which will not be
settled without the consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, SBI shall not make or change any election with respect to Taxes,
adopt or change any method of accounting with respect to Taxes, file any
amended Return, surrender any right to a claim for Taxes, or enter into any
binding agreement or arrangement with the Internal Revenue Service (or any
other Tax authority), or consent to any extensions or waiver of
the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment.



 

25 5.2 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent covenants and
agrees that from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement, unless SBI otherwise agrees in
writing or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, Parent will cause its
business to be conducted only in the ordinary course of business, and will
not engage in any business or activity, or enter into any agreement, that will
make it difficult or impossible to complete the Merger or to carry out its
obligations under this Agreement.



ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



6.1 _Access and Information_. Parent and SBI each hereby covenants and agrees
that it will afford to the other, and the others authorized representatives,
full access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Effective Time to all of its properties upon reasonable prior notice and
shall use reasonable efforts to make its directors, management, other
employees and authorized representatives available to confer with the other,
and the others authorized representatives (upon reasonable notice) and,
during such period, Parent and SBI each will (i) make available all of its
records relating to its assets, properties, operations, obligations and
liabilities, including but not limited to, all books of account (including
the general ledger), tax records and returns, minute books of directors,
committees and stockholders meetings, Organizational Documents, Material
Contracts, filings with and communications from any regulatory authority,
accountants work papers, litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any
other business activities or prospects as the other may from time to time
reasonably request, and (ii) promptly furnish to the other all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
may reasonably request provided that the provision of such materials does not
require the expenditure of a significant amount or money by the party
providing such information and materials. Throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and SBI each will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to be available to confer on a regular and frequent basis with
representatives of the other and to report the general status of its ongoing
operations.



6.2 _Registration Statement_. Parent agrees that after the Effective Date it
will cause Parent Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, to
be registered at such times and in such manner as are set forth in an
Investors Rights Agreement, the material terms of which are attached hereto
as Exhibit B (the "Investors Rights Agreement"). Parent further agrees that it
will use its best efforts to file in a timely manner all forms, reports and
other documents that it is required to file with the SEC pursuant to the
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in order for Parent to
continue to be qualified to register its securities on Form S-3 (or its
successor form).



6.3 _Additional Agreements; Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable on the
part of such party, to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest practicable date, including
using its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all required

all notices, and make or effect all filings, registrations, applications,
designations and declarations; and each party shall cooperate fully with the
other (including by providing any necessary information) with respect to the
foregoing. SBI and Parent each will make commercially reasonable efforts to
conduct its business so that its representations and warranties shall be true
and correct at the Effective Time (except those representations and warranties
which are expressly limited to some other date, except those affected by
actions contemplated or permitted hereby and except those waived pursuant to
Section 6.5) with the same force and effect as if such representations and
warranties were made anew at and as of the Effective Time. In the event any
claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by any Governmental
Entity or other person is



 

26 commenced which questions the validity or legality of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection
therewith, the parties agree to cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts to defend against such claim, action, suit, investigation or other
proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is issued in any such action,
suit, or other proceeding, to use all reasonable efforts to have such
injunction or other order lifted, and to cooperate reasonably regarding any
other impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party shall give prompt written notice to the other of (i)
the occurrence or failure to occur of any event which occurrence or failure
has caused or could reasonably be expected to cause any representation or
warranty of SBI or Parent as the case may be, contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate at any time from the date hereof to the Effective Time
or that will result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions specified
in Article V and (ii) any failure of SBI or Parent as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder.



6.4 _Publicity_. Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, neither SBI nor Parent will, prior to the Effective
Time, issue, or permit to be issued any press release or other announcement
or public disclosure of matters related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other party,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any applicable listing agreement of Parent. To the extent
disclosure is required, the parties agree to consult with each other and give
to each other the opportunity to review and comment on any such disclosure.
SBI acknowledges and agrees that the disclosure of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby by Parent (i) in connection with a financing
by Parent used to raise funds to substitute cash for Convertible Notes
as contemplated by Section 1.7.1.3 hereof or (ii) on a Form 8-K filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission at any time after the date hereof, in a
customary press release or on a customary analyst call will not be violation
of this Section 6.4. 



6.5 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

 



6.5.1 _Bylaws Indemnification Provision_. The Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification than are set forth in the Bylaws of SBI, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of SBI, unless such
modification shall be required by law.



6.5.2 _Indemnification_. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, each present and former director, officer or employee of SBI or any
SBI Subsidiary, other than the SBI Subsidiaries that are included in the
Distribution Assets (collectively, the "SBI Indemnified Parties") against any
costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, (x)
arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated herein or (y)
otherwise with respect to any acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, to the same extent as provided in SBI Organizational Documents
or any applicable contract or agreement as in effect on the date hereof, in
each case for a period of six years after the date hereof. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time) and subject to the specific terms of any
indemnification contract, (i) any counsel retained by the SBI Indemnified
Parties for any period after the Effective Time shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, (ii) after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received and (iii) the
Surviving



 

27 Corporation will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided, further, that, in the event
that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within
such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such
claim or claims shall continue until the disposition of any and all such
claims. The SBI Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm
(plus local counsel, if applicable) to represent them with respect to any
single action unless there is, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two
or more SBI Indemnified Parties, in which case each SBI Indemnified Party
with respect to whom such a conflict exists (or group of such SBI Indemnified
Parties who among them have no such conflict) may retain one separate law
firm.



6.5.3 _Insurance_. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for six
years from the Effective Time the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies maintained by SBI (provided that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions that are substantially similar) with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that if the
aggregate annual premiums for such insurance at any time during such period
exceed 200% of the premium paid by SBI for such insurance as of the date
of this Agreement, then the Surviving Corporation shall provide the maximum
coverage that will then be available at an annual premium equal to 200% of
such per annum rate as of the date of this Agreement. The parties agree to
mutually cooperate with respect to providing information and other matter in
response to any claims made under insurance coverage subsequent to the Closing
that is based on acts prior to the Closing.



6.5.4 _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.5.



6.6 _SBI Options._



6.6.1 _Acceleration and Vesting_. Pursuant to the plan administrators
authority under SBIs 1998 Stock Option Plan (the "SBI Option Plan") and/or
applicable SBI Option Agreements, as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, SBIs Board of Directors or any committee administering the
SBI Option Plan will adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may
be required or appropriate in the sole discretion of SBI to provide that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexercised and outstanding SBI
Option will fully vest and become exercisable. 



6.6.2 _SBI Option Payments_. As provided in Section 1.8, each unexercised and
outstanding SBI Option shall be canceled without any action on the part of the
holder thereof at the Effective Time. The holder of each In The Money SBI
Option so cancelled shall thereupon become entitled to receive from Parent an
amount, payable in cash only, equal to the Option Spread Payment, and
thereafter all rights of such holder associated with the SBI Option shall be
terminated and canceled. Prior to the Effective Date, SBI shall provide
written notice to the holders of unexercised and outstanding SBI Options
regarding the possible cancellation of SBI Options (as a result of the Merger)
and the possible receipt of an Option Spread Payment. Parent will make any
such payments promptly following the Effective Time.



6.6.3 _Termination of SBI Option Plan, SBI Options and SBI Option
Agreements_. As of the Effective Time, the SBI Option Plan will terminate. At
and after the Effective Time, no person will have



 

28 any right under SBI Options (including the warrants held by Madeleine LLC) or
the SBI Option Plan or any SBI Option Agreements with respect to equity
securities of the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof, except the
right to receive the Option Spread Payment.



6.7 _Compensation of SBI Employees_. During the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof, Parent will provide
(or will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide) employees that were
employees of SBI immediately prior to the Closing and who become (and remain)
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries ("SBI Employees") with salary
equivalent to that provided by SBI to such employees immediately prior to the
Closing, and with benefits under the employee benefit plans of Parent that are
not materially less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by Parent
to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. For purposes
of eligibility and vesting under such employee benefit plans, Parent will
recognize (or cause to be recognized) service with SBI and any predecessor
entities. In addition, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the relevant insurer to (i) waive (with respect to SBI Employees) any
preexisting condition limitations under any medical plan extended by Parent to
SBI Employees, but only to the extent such SBI Employees had coverage for
such condition under a similar SBI Benefit Plan, and (ii) credit any
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses that are applicable and/or covered
under its medical or dental plans that are incurred by SBI Employees and their
spouses and dependents during the portion of the calendar year prior to
participation in such medical and dental plans. The provisions of this Section
will not create in any SBI Employee any rights to employment or continued
employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or limit or otherwise
affect the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to terminate the employment or change the place of work,
responsibilities, status or description of any employee or group of
employees.



6.8 _Severance Payments to SBI Officers and Employees_. In connection with
the Merger, SBI will incur severance obligations to its officers and employees
pursuant to the agreements and arrangements and in the amounts set forth on
Section 4.9.4 of the _SBI Disclosure Schedule_. Parent agrees that at
the dates indicated on Section 4.9.4 of the SBI Disclosure Schedule it will
cause payments (less any amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign law in connection
with such payment) to be made to such officers and employees in the
respective amounts set forth on Section 4.9.4 of the _SBI Disclosure
Schedule_. It shall be a condition to the receipt of such severance payments
that the employee sign a release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent.



6.9 _HSR Act Filing_. To the extent required by the HSR Act, within five (5)
business days following the execution of this Agreement, each of Parent and
SBI will file a Notification and Report Form and related material with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice under the HSR Act, will use its respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain early termination of the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act, and will take all further actions and make all further
filings pursuant to the HSR Act that may be necessary, proper or advisable.



6.10  _Disposition of Distribution Assets_. It is the understanding and
intention of the parties that prior to the Closing SBI shall sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of the capital stock, assets and businesses that are
described on Section 6.10 of the _SBI Disclosure Schedule_ (the "Distribution
Assets"). No changes or adjustments shall be made to the Merger Consideration
as a result of the disposition of the Distribution Assets. At least ten (10)
days before the scheduled Closing Date, SBI shall provide to Parent (i) a
schedule (the "Taxable Income/Loss Schedule"), which shall be in a form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, computing the estimated federal
taxable income (or loss) of the SBI Affiliated Group for the Taxable period
ended on the Closing Date and (ii) all material workpapers in connection with
the preparation of the Taxable Income/Loss Schedule.



 

29 6.11 _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. SBI agrees to terminate or cause the
termination of the SBI Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries 401(k) Retirement
Savings Plan and the Razorfish 401(k) Plan (collectively, the "SBI 401(k)
Plans"), unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor
and maintain such plans by providing SBI with written notice of such election
at least five (5) days prior to Closing Date. Unless Parent provides such
notice to SBI, SBI shall provide Parent with evidence satisfactory to Parent
that the SBI 401(k) Plans have been terminated pursuant to
resolutions adopted by the appropriate corporate body or bodies (the form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to advance review and approval
by Parent), effective not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date; provided, however, that SBI shall not be under any obligation to cause
the distribution of the SBI 401(k) Plans assets on or prior to the Closing
Date, to obtain a determination letter from the IRS or to take any other
action with respect to the winding up of the SBI 401(k) Plans prior to the
Effective Time.



6.12 _Intercompany Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, SBI covenants and agrees that, prior to the Closing Date, SBI will
enter into, and will take all action necessary to cause one or more of its
subsidiaries and any entity that is formed in connection with the disposition
of the Distribution Assets (as contemplated herein) to enter into, one or more
intercompany agreements with Parent (including without limitation, a
transitional services agreement having the key terms set forth in Exhibit
7.1.9 and tax sharing agreement having the key terms set forth in Exhibit
6.12) as of the date hereof (but expressly contingent upon Closing of the
Merger); provided that any such agreement shall be subject to the review and
approval by Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).



6.13 _Tax Election_. Parent agrees that it will not, and will not cause or
permit SBI or any Subsidiary to, file an election under Section 338 of the
Code with respect to the Merger.

been cured in all material respects within ten days after SBIs written notice
thereof to Parent.



8.1.4 _By Parent_. By Parent prior to the consummation of the Merger if (i)
the representations and warranties of SBI contained in Article IV of this
Agreement fail to be true and correct in any material respect (or if the
representation or warranty already is qualified as to materiality, shall fail
to be true and correct as so qualified) either (A) as of the date referred to
in any representation or warranty that addresses matters as of a particular
date or (B) as to all other representations and warranties, as of the date of
determination, provided, however, that Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (i) unless the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) SBI materially breaches or materially fails to perform its
covenants and other agreements contained herein, (iii) SBIs Board of
Directors shall have (A) failed to recommend the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger to SBIs stockholders, (B) withdrawn its
recommendation, (C) modified or qualified, in any manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser, its recommendation, (D) failed to reaffirm its recommendation in
favor of the adoption and approval of the Agreement and the approval of the
Merger within ten (10) business days after Parent requests in writing that
such recommendation be reaffirmed at any time following the announcement of an
Acquisition Proposal or (E) the Board of Directors of SBI shall have approved
or recommended any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) SBI shall have failed to comply
in any material respect with the provisions of Sections 5.1.7 or 5.1.8 of this
Agreement; provided further that, with respect to the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii), such breach or failure cannot be or has not been cured in all
material respects within ten days after Parents written notice thereof to
SBI.



8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If any party terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1 above, except as set forth in this Section 8.2, all rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder will terminate without any liability of
any party to any other party, except for any liability of any party then in
breach, provided that the provisions of this Article VIII and Article IX will
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.



_8.2.1 Payment to Parent_. If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1.4(i) or (ii), then SBI shall reimburse Parent up to an aggregate
of $1,000,000 for Parents reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If (i) Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.4(iii), (ii) SBI has
effected a Change in Recommendation and Parent or SBI terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.2.3 or Section 8.1.2.4, or (iii)
Parent or SBI terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.2.3 and an
Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or made to the stockholders of SBI
within nine (9) months after such termination and such Acquisition Proposal
is ultimately completed, SBI shall pay, or cause to be paid to Parent, within
five business days of the time of the earlier of (i) the execution by SBI of a
definitive agreement related to such Acquisition Proposal or (ii) completion
of such Acquisition Proposal, an amount in immediately available funds equal
to $4,800,000 plus up to $1,000,000 of reasonable documented out-of-pocket
expenses directly related to the Merger.



 

34 8.2.2 _Payment to SBI_. If (i) SBI terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1.3(i) or (ii) and (ii) Parent has not provided written notice to
SBI of its intention to substitute cash for the Note Consideration as provided
in Section 1.7.1.3, then Parent shall reimburse SBI up to an aggregate of
$1,000,000 for SBIs reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



8.2.3. _Liquidated Damages._ The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the
amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.2 will constitute liquidated damages
and not a penalty and will be the sole and exclusive remedy for any loss,
liability, damage or claim arising out of or related to any termination of
this Agreement on the bases specified in this Article VIII.



8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 8.2, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
will be paid by the party incurring such expenses if the Merger is not
consummated, and by the Surviving Corporation if the Merger is consummated;
provided, however, that the completion bonuses approved by the Board of
Directors of SBI and the legal and accounting fees, brokers fee and the fees
of William Blair and Co. incurred by SBI in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby that are not paid by SBI prior to the
Closing shall reduce the aggregate Cash Consideration (or the Aggregate Merger
Consideration in the event cash is substituted for Convertible Notes pursuant
to Section 1.7.1.3) and the Option Base Amount by the full amount of such
fees and expenses; provided that, the amount of such reduction shall be offset
by any amounts paid by SBI prior to the Closing with respect to Parents
obligation under Section 6.5.3 (provided that no such amounts shall be paid by
SBI without the consent of Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld);
and provided, further, should any action be brought hereunder, the attorneys
fees and expenses of the prevailing party shall be paid by the other party to
such action. SBI shall deliver to Parent at Closing a certificate detailing
the amount of the unpaid fees and expenses that reduce the aggregate Cash
Consideration and the Option Base Amount. Parent agrees that at the Closing it
will cause payments (less any amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign law in
connection with such payment) to be made to the persons and in the respective
amounts set forth on the certificate delivered by Parent at the Closing.



8.4 _Waiver_. At any time, the parties hereto may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) except
as prohibited by law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein that are for the benefit of such party or its
stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party.



8.5 _Indemnification_.



8.5.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All of the
representations and warranties of SBI and Parent contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect until one year
following the Closing Date (the "Survival Period").



8.5.2 _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of Parent_.



8.5.2.1 Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, from and
after the Closing, the Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, their
officers, directors and affiliates (the "Parent Indemnified Parties") shall be
indemnified and held harmless from and against, and shall be reimbursed
solely through the Indemnity Escrow for the following liabilities and Losses
(the "Indemnified Losses"):



(i) any and all Losses arising out of any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in,
or breach of, any representation or warranty made by SBI in this Agreement,
together with the _SBI Disclosure Schedule_ s, or in any document required to
be delivered pursuant to this Agreement by SBI;



 

35 (ii) any and all Losses arising out of any failure by SBI to perform or
comply, in whole or in part, with any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement;



(iii) all liability for Taxes of SBI or any of the SBI Subsidiaries assessed
during or attributable to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date (and for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date and ending
after the Closing Date, the portion ending on the Closing Date) to the extent
such Taxes exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) set forth as a current liability on the face of the Final Closing
Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto);



(iv) any liability for Taxes of SBI or any of the SBI Subsidiaries resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without
limitation any Taxes resulting from the disposition of the Distribution Assets
contemplated in Section 6.10 hereof to the extent such Taxes exceed the
reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income)
set forth as a current liability on the face of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet;



(v) any Loss resulting from a claim, demand, cause of action, suit,
proceeding, hearing or investigation by any person or entity relating to
SBIs operations on or before the Closing Date; provided, that no
indemnification shall be available with respect to such claims, demands,
causes of actions, suits, proceedings, hearings and investigations disclosed
on Section 4.11 of the  _SBI Disclosure Schedule_ (the "Disclosed Litigation
Claims") unless the aggregate amount of Losses from such Disclosed Litigation
Claims exceeds the amount reserved for such Disclosed Litigation Claims as a
current liability on the face of the Final Closing Balance Sheet;



(vi) any Loss with respect to any of the matters related to the SBI Benefit
Plans disclosed on Section 4.9.3 of the SBI Disclosure Schedule where such
Loss is in excess of any reserve established or otherwise reflected for such
matter as a current liability on the face of the Final Closing Balance Sheet;



(vii) those expenses of SBI incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby that are not deducted from the Aggregate Merger
Consideration as set forth in Sections 1.7.1 and 8.3 hereof ;



(viii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Razorfish
payroll tax accrual (the "IRS Liability") and any Losses arising out of or
related thereto in excess of the carrying balance of the IRS Liability as
accounted for on the face of the Final Closing Balance Sheet; or



(ix) the downward adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration, if any,
contemplated by Section 1.7.2.4.



For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on
a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax



 

36 which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date
shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Tax period through and including the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case
of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing
Date. For purposes of Sections 8.5.2.1(iii) and (iv) above, to the extent
permitted under applicable law, the liability (if any) of SBI or its
Subsidiaries for U.S. federal, state or local income Taxes shall be computed
on a consolidated or combined return basis and shall be calculated after
applying all available consolidated or combined net operating loss and capital
loss carryovers so as to minimize any such income Tax liability.



8.5.2.2 The Parent Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified solely through
the Indemnity Escrow; provided, however, that the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall not be indemnified from and against any Losses until the Parent
Indemnified Parties have suffered, in the aggregate, Losses by reason of all
such breaches in excess of $750,000 (the "Threshold") (at which point the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified, solely through the Indemnity
Escrow, from and against all such Losses in excess of the Threshold).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in each instance the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall be indemnified solely through the Indemnity Escrow without
regard to the Threshold for (i) Losses related to Disclosed Litigation Claims
in excess of the litigation reserves established or otherwise reflected on
the Final Closing Balance Sheet, (ii) Losses related to or arising out of a
breach of Section 4.9.3 and Losses related to any matters reflected on Section
4.9.3 of the SBI Disclosure Schedule where such Loss is in excess of the
amount reserved for such matter on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, (iii)
income taxes with respect to the disposition of the Distribution Assets in
excess of the Tax reserves established or otherwise reflected on the Final
Closing Balance Sheet, (iv) Losses related to third party claims made with
respect to the disposition of the Distribution Assets, (v) Losses related to
or arising out of the IRS Liability in excess of the Carrying Amount; and (vi)
the downward adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration, if any,
contemplated by Section 1.7.2.4. Up to $500,000 of the reasonable costs and
expenses of the SBI Representative shall be paid in cash out of the Indemnity
Escrow, as provided in Section 8.5.8. All cash and Convertible Notes
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow upon expiration of the Survival Period shall
be disbursed to the SBI Stockholders on a pro rata basis; provided, that
Convertible Notes shall be disbursed only to the former holders of the Series
B Shares. A Parent Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to be reimbursed
with respect to any claims made by the Parent Indemnified Party after the
expiration of the Survival Period, except that indemnity may be sought after
the expiration of the Survival Period (i) if a Claim Notice (as defined in
Section 8.5.4) shall have been delivered to the SBI Representative prior to
the expiration of such time period, in which case the amount specified in the
Claim Notice shall remain subject to the Indemnity Escrow and (ii) if Parent
reasonably believes in good faith that there are potential Indemnified Losses
that are likely to result in actual Indemnified Losses and prior to the
expiration of the Survival Period provides notice to the Shareholder
Representative (the "Reserve Amount Notice") setting forth the estimated
amount of such potential Indemnified Losses (the "Reserve Amount") and the
facts and circumstances on which such Reserve Amount is based, in which case
the Reserve Amount shall remain subject to the Indemnity Escrow until such
potential Indemnified Losses are in the reasonable belief of Parent no longer
likely to result in an actual Indemnified Loss. If the potential Indemnified
Loss for which Parent has identified a Reserve Amount results in an actual
Indemnified Loss, such Loss shall be deemed to have occurred during the
Survival Period. The SBI Representative may dispute any Reserve Amount
contained in the Reserve Amount Notice provided, however, that the SBI
Representative shall have notified Parent in writing of each disputed item,
specifying the amount thereof in dispute, the calculation of the disputed
amount and setting forth, in reasonable



 

37 detail, the basis for such dispute, within 30 calendar days of the SBI
Representatives receipt of the Reserve Amount Notice.. The SBI
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Reserve Amount Notice In the event of such a dispute, Parent
and the SBI Representative shall attempt in good faith to reconcile their
differences. If Parent and the SBI Representative are unable to reach a
resolution within 30 calendar days after receipt by Parent of the SBI
Representatives written notice of dispute, Parent and the SBI Representative
shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to an independent
expert of national reputation as may be mutually acceptable to Parent and the
SBI Representative (who shall not, unless otherwise acceptable to the parties,
have any material relationship with Parent, SBI, the SBI Representative or
the SBI Shareholders) (the "Independent Expert"), which shall, within 60
calendar days of such submission, determine and report to Parent and the SBI
Representative upon such remaining disputed items, and such report shall be
final, binding and conclusive on Parent and the SBI Shareholders. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Expert shall be paid by Parent; provided
however, that if the Independent Expert shall determine that Reserve Amounts
are reasonable or if the Independent Expert determines that the net total
variance of all items disputed by the SBI Representative is at least 90% of
the amount calculated by Parent in the Reserve Amount Notice, then such fees
and disbursements of the Independent Expert shall be paid out of the Indemnity
Escrow.



8.5.3 _Indemnity Escrow_. The "Holdback" shall consist of $10,700,000 of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration to be deposited in escrow at Closing with an
escrow agent reasonably acceptable to SBI and Parent, and pursuant to an
escrow agreement that is reasonably acceptable to SBI and Parent (the
"Indemnity Escrow"). The Parent Indemnified Parties shall be paid,
compensated or otherwise reimbursed solely through and from the Indemnity
Escrow. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement,
including this Section 8.5, shall be construed to limit any rights of the
Parent Indemnified Parties for full indemnification or otherwise against any
SBI Stockholder severally with respect to the failure of such SBI Stockholder
to have good, valid and marketable title to any SBI Shares held by such SBI
Stockholder as represented herein, free and clear of all Liens or to have the
full right, capacity and authority to vote all of such SBI Shares in favor of
the Merger and any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement; provided
that in no event shall any SBI Stockholder have liability to the Parent
Indemnified Parties for Losses in excess of the Merger Consideration payable
to such SBI Stockholder. On expiration of the Survival Period, all amounts in
the Indemnity Escrow that have not been used to compensate a Parent
Indemnified Party as provided in this Article VIII or which do not constitute
a Reserve Amount under the provisions of Section 8.5.2.2, shall be distributed
to the SBI Stockholders, pro rata in proportion to the amount each was
entitled to receive of the Merger Consideration payable to the SBI
Stockholders. On resolution of the claim underlying any Reserve Amount or on
expiration of three years from the expiration of the Survival Period without a
formal proceeding having been filed against the Parent Indemnified Parties
with respect to the underlying claim, such Reserve Amount shall be distributed
to the SBI Shareholders in the same proportion as set forth above. On any
distribution from the Indemnity Escrow, interest accrued on the
Convertible Notes shall be allocated between Parent and the SBI Stockholders
based on the respective portions of the Holdback amount otherwise received by
them pursuant to this Section 8.5.



8.5.4 _Procedure for Indemnification_.



8.5.4.1 A Parent Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the "Claim
Notice") of any claim for indemnification under this Article VIII (a "Claim")
to the SBI Representative, on behalf of the indemnifying parties, reasonably
promptly after the assertion against a Parent Indemnified Party of any claim
by a third party (a "Third Party Claim") or, if such Claim is not in respect
of a Third Party Claim, reasonably promptly after the discovery of facts on
which the Parent Indemnified Party intends to base a Claim for indemnification
pursuant to Article VIII; provided, 



 

38 however, that the failure or delay to so notify the SBI Representative shall
not relieve the indemnifying party of any obligation or liability that the
indemnifying party may have to the Parent Indemnified Party except to the
extent that the SBI Representative demonstrates that the indemnifying parties
ability to defend or resolve such Claim is adversely affected thereby. Any
such Claim Notice shall describe the facts and circumstances on which the
asserted Claim for indemnification is based and shall specify how such Parent
Indemnified Party intends to recover such funds pursuant to this Agreement
and the basis for the determination of the amount which the Parent Indemnified
Party intends to recover.



8.5.4.2 If, within 30 days of the receipt by the SBI Representative of a Claim
Notice, the SBI Representative contests in writing to the Parent Indemnified
Party that Losses identified in such Claim Notice constitute indemnifiable
Claims (the "Representative Notice"), then the Parent Indemnified Party and
the SBI Representative, acting in good faith, shall attempt to
reach agreement with respect to the contested portions of such Claims. Unless
a Claim is contested within such 30-day period, the Parent Indemnified Party
shall, subject to the other terms of this Article VIII, be paid the amount of
the Losses related to such Claim or the uncontested portion thereof. The SBI
Representative shall not object to any Claim unless (i) it believes in good
faith that the Parent Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified with
respect to the Losses specified therein, or (ii) it lacks sufficient
information to assess the validity or amount of the Claim. If the SBI
Representative objects to a Claim on the basis that it lacks sufficient
information, it shall promptly request from the Parent Indemnified Party any
additional information reasonably necessary for it to assess such Claim and
the Parent Indemnified Party shall, to the extent the Parent Indemnified Party
reasonably can, provide additional information reasonably requested. Upon
receipt of such additional information, the SBI Representative shall review
it as soon as reasonably practicable and notify the Parent Indemnified Party
of any withdrawal or modification of the objection. If the Parent Indemnified
Party and the SBI Representative are unable to reach agreement with respect
to any contested Claims within 45 days of the delivery of the Representative
Notice, the matter shall be settled by binding arbitration in Seattle,
Washington as set forth below. All claims shall be settled in accordance with
the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA Rules"). The SBI Representative and the Parent
Indemnified Party shall each designate one arbitrator within 15 days after
the termination of such 45-day period. The SBI Representative and the Parent
Indemnified Party shall cause such designated arbitrators mutually to agree
upon and designate a third arbitrator; provided, however, that (i)
failing such agreement within 70 days of delivery of the Representative
Notice, the third arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the AAA
Rules and (ii) if either the SBI Representative or the Parent Indemnified
Party fails to timely designate an arbitrator, the dispute shall be resolved
by the one arbitrator timely designated. All of the fees and expenses of the
arbitrators shall be paid from proceeds of the Indemnity Escrow. The SBI
Representative and the Parent Indemnified Party shall cause the arbitrators
to decide the matter to be arbitrated pursuant hereto within 30 days after the
appointment of the last arbitrator. The arbitrators decision shall relate
solely to whether the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified
for the contested Claim, or the contested portion thereof, pursuant to the
applicable terms of this Agreement. The final decision of the majority of the
arbitrators shall be furnished to the SBI Representative and the Parent
Indemnified Party in writing and shall constitute the conclusive
determination of the issue in question binding upon the SBI Representative,
the SBI Stockholders, and the Parent Indemnified Party, and shall not be
contested by any of them. Such decision may be used in a court of law only
for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrators decision.



8.5.4.3 The indemnifying party will have the right to defend the Parent
Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim at the indemnifying partys
sole expense with counsel of its



 

39 choice reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Indemnified Party so long as the
indemnifying party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may
elect to assume the defense and handle any such Third Party Claim if it
determines in good faith that the resolution of such Third Party Claim could
result in a material adverse impact on the business, operations, assets,
liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), condition (financial
or otherwise) or prospects of Parent; and provided further that
the indemnifying person is also a person against whom the Third Party Claim
is made and the Parent Indemnified person determines in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate). The Parent Indemnified Party may
retain separate co-counsel and participate in the defense of the Third Party
Claim which shall be at the Parent Indemnified Partys sole cost and expense
so long as the indemnifying party conducts the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently. The Parent Indemnified Party will not consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
and the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Parent Indemnified Party which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.



_8.5.5 Indemnification Provision for Benefit of the SBI Stockholders_. In the
event Parent breaches any of its covenants, representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, provided that any of the SBI Stockholders or the
SBI Representative makes a written claim for indemnification against Parent (
in the same manner as provided in Section 8.5.4 with respect to a Parent
Indemnified Party) within the Survival Period, then Parent agrees to indemnify
each of the SBI Stockholders and any director, officer representative or agent
thereof (the "Stockholder Indemnified Parties") from and against any Losses
the Stockholder Indemnified Parties may suffer through and after the date of
the claim for indemnification resulting from, arising out of, relating to or
caused by the breach; provided however that Parent shall not have any
obligation to indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified Parties from and against
any losses resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or
caused by the breach of any representation or warranty until the Stockholder
Indemnified Parties have suffered, in the aggregate, Losses by reason of all
such breaches in excess of the Threshold (at which point Parent will be
obligated to indemnify the Stockholders Indemnified Parties from and against
all such Losses in excess of the Threshold); provided however, that in no
event shall the aggregate amount paid to the Stockholder Indemnified Parties
exceed the amount of $10,000,000. Any notice to be delivered pursuant to this
Section by any Stockholder Indemnified Party may be delivered by the SBI
Representative on behalf of such Stockholder Indemnified Party. The procedures
set forth in Section 8.5.4 shall be fully applicable with respect to claims by
a Stockholder Indemnified Party or the SBI Representative, subject to
appropriate changes to properly denominate the correct parties.



8.5.6 _Cooperation_. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, reasonably cooperate in
the defense or prosecution of any suit, action, claim, proceeding or
investigation for which such Indemnifying Party is being called upon to
indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 8.5, and the
Indemnified Party shall furnish such records, information and testimony and
attend all such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and
appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith and, if
appropriate, the Indemnified Party shall make any reasonable counterclaim
against the party asserting such suit, action, claim, proceeding or
investigation or any reasonably cross-complaint against any person in
connection therewith and the Indemnified Party further agrees to take such
other actions as it deems reasonable pursuant to any request by an
Indemnifying Party to reduce or eliminate any Losses for which the
Indemnifying Party would have responsibility.



 

40 8.5.7 _Sole Remedy_. This Section 8.5 constitutes the sole remedy any Party
may have with respect to any breach of the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement, except as specifically provided in
Sections 8.2 and 9.3.



8.5.8 _SBI Representative_. L. Tim Pierce (or such other person or entity that
shall be designated by L. Tim Pierce) shall serve as the representative of
SBI and/or the SBI Stockholders with respect to any matters arising pursuant
to this Section 8.5 (the "SBI Representative"). The SBI Representative is
hereby fully authorized with respect to the Indemnity Escrow to: (i) receive
all notices or other documents given or to be given by Parent under this
Agreement or pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow; (ii) receive and accept service
of legal process in connection with any claim or other proceeding arising
under this Agreement or the Indemnity Escrow; (iii) undertake, compromise,
defend and settle any such suit or proceeding; (iv) engage special counsel,
accountants and other advisors and incur such other expenses in connection
with any matter arising under this Agreement or the Indemnity Escrow as the
SBI Representative deems appropriate; (v) take such other action as such SBI
Representative may deem appropriate, including without limitation, (A) taking
any actions required or permitted under this Agreement or the Indemnity
Escrow to protect or enforce the SBI Stockholders rights, and (B) all such
other matters as the SBI Representative may deem necessary or appropriate to
carry out the intents and purposes of this Agreement and the
Indemnity Escrow. The SBI Representative shall have no liability whatsoever
to any SBI Stockholder or its beneficiaries, heirs or personal representatives
for any matters arising out of this Agreement or the Indemnity Escrow, except
for liability for such matters which are determined in a final judgment of a
court to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the SBI Representative. The SBI Representative shall be
reimbursed for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred
or made by it in the performance of its duties hereunder, (x) from up to
$500,000 in cash of the Holdback deposited in the Indemnity Escrow, to the
extent reasonably required by the SBI Representative; and (y) from any cash
or Convertible Notes remaining in the Indemnity Escrow prior to the
distribution of such cash or Convertible Notes to the SBI Stockholders.
