Sections 7.1, 7.2(b) (other than the delivery of the officers\' certificate
referred to therein) and 7.3(b) (other than the delivery of the officers\'
certificate referred to therein), provided that the other closing conditions

in the Surviving Corporation, and all property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises, and all and every other interest shall be thereafter as
effectually the property of the Surviving Corporation as they were of the
Constituent Corporations, and the title to any real estate vested by deed or
otherwise, in either of the Constituent Corporations, shall not revert or be
in any way impaired but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any
property of either of the Constituent Corporations shall be preserved
unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Constituent
Corporations shall thereafter attach to the Surviving Corporation, and may be
enforced against it to the same extent as if such debts and liabilities had
been incurred by it.   Section 1.4 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The initial
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the persons
identified on SCHEDULE 1.4 hereto, each of whom will hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving

the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sensors or capital stock

CONVERSION OF SENSORS COMMON STOCK. Subject to Sections 2.2(c) and 2.4, each
issued and outstanding share of Sensors Common Stock, other than Dissenting

elect to receive Cash Merger Consideration in lieu of more than 20% of the
total number of Firm Merger Shares to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled, and (ii) if the aggregate Cash Merger Consideration which the
shareholders elect to receive, together with any additional payments or
distributions by the Company which could be deemed to be cash payments in
respect to the Merger exceeds 20% of the value of the Firm Merger Shares, the
amount of Cash Merger Consideration which the electing shareholders may
receive will be reduced pro-rata so that the    4   sum of all Cash
Merger Consideration plus such other cash payments equals 19.9% of the value
of the Firm Merger Shares.   (d) SENSORS STOCK OPTIONS. At the Effective
Time, all then outstanding options to purchase Sensors Common Stock (the

The achievement of each of the Milestones shall be determined on the basis of
the criteria set forth in the Sensors Research and Development Plan.  
Section 2.4 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. The procedures for
exchanging outstanding shares of Sensors Common Stock for Finisar Common
Stock and cash pursuant to the Merger are as follows:   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT.
At the Effective Time, Finisar shall deposit with an exchange agent
designated by Finisar (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Sensors Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Section 2.4, through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing the
Firm Merger Shares and any Cash Merger Consideration issuable and payable to
the holders of Sensors Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2 and (ii)
certificates representing the Performance Shares, issuable and deliverable to
the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.5 (such cash and shares of Finisar
Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"), in exchange for outstanding shares of Sensors Common
Stock.   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. At the Closing or within ten (10)
days thereafter, Finisar shall provide to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Sensors Common Stock (each a "Certificate,"
and collectively, the "Certificates") whose shares were converted pursuant
to Section 2.2 into the right to receive shares of Finisar Common Stock and
Cash Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Finisar and Sensors may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Finisar Common Stock and Cash Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Finisar, together with a
duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing the
number of whole Firm Merger Shares which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2(b) and (y) cash representing any
Cash Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to the provisions of Section 2.2(c). Certificates representing the number of
whole Performance Shares which such holder has the right to receive shall be
placed in escrow pursuant to Section 2.5. The Certificate so surrendered
shall immediately be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Sensors    5   Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of Sensors, a certificate representing the Firm Merger Shares and any
Cash Merger Consideration to which the holder is entitled may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Sensors Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.4, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
certificate representing shares of Finisar Common Stock, Cash Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Finisar Common
Stock as contemplated by this Section 2.4.   (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT
TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
after the Effective Time with respect to Finisar Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Finisar Common Stock
represented thereby and no Cash Merger Consideration or cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares payable to any such holder pursuant to subsection (e)
below shall be paid until the holder of record of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Finisar Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, any Cash Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Finisar
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to subsection (e)
below and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of
Finisar Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of Finisar Common Stock.   (d) NO FURTHER
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN SENSORS COMMON STOCK. All shares of Finisar Common Stock
and cash issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Sensors
Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to subsection (c) or (e) of this Section 2.4) shall be deemed to
have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Sensors Common Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Sensors Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.4.   (e) NO
FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of
Finisar Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Finisar. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Sensors
Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Finisar Common Stock (after
taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive,
in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Finisar Common Stock multiplied by the Finisar
Share Price.    6    (f) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the shareholders of Sensors
after one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Finisar, upon
demand, and any shareholders of Sensors who have not previously complied with
this Section 2.4 shall thereafter look only to Finisar for payment of their
claim for Finisar Common Stock, any Cash Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Finisar Common Stock, and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Finisar Common Stock.   (g) NO LIABILITY.
Neither Finisar nor Sensors shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Sensors Common Stock or Finisar Common Stock, as the case may be, for such
shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   (h) LOST CERTIFICATES. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
Finisar shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the shares of Finisar Common Stock and any Cash Merger
Consideration issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II, together with cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with Section 2.4(e) hereof. The Board of Directors of Finisar may
in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide to
Finisar an indemnity agreement against any claim that may be made against
Finisar with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   Section 2.5 ESCROW.   (a) At the Closing, the Exchange Agent
will deposit into escrow (the "Escrow") certificates representing the
Performance Shares (the "Escrow Shares"). The Escrow Shares shall be held by
First Trust of California or such other financial institution as Finisar and
Sensors shall mutually determine (the "Escrow Agent") in accordance with and
subject to the provisions of an Escrow Agreement substantially in the form of
EXHIBIT B hereto (the "Escrow Agreement").   (b) Within ten (10) days
following the first anniversary of the Closing Date (or at such later date as
determined pursuant to the Sensors Research and Development Plan), one-third
of the Performance Shares shall be released from the Escrow and delivered to
the persons who held shares of Sensors Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, on a pro rata basis, if at least two of the Milestones have
been achieved prior to such date. Within ten (10) days following the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, (or at such later date as determined
pursuant to the Sensors Research and Development Plan), two-thirds of the
Performance Shares (less the number of Performance Shares, if any, previously
released) shall be released from the Escrow and delivered to the former
shareholders of Sensors, on a pro rata basis, if at least four of the
Milestones have been achieved prior to such date. Within ten (10) days
following the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the balance of the
Performance Shares shall be released from the Escrow and delivered to the
former shareholders of Sensors, on a pro rata basis, if all six of the
Milestones have been achieved prior to such date.    7    (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the portion of the Escrow Shares specified in
Section 9.2(b) shall be subject to claims of indemnification under Article IX
of this Agreement and the procedures specified in the Escrow Agreement.
Subject to the provisions of Section 9.2(d), the sole recourse
for indemnification claims under Article IX shall be limited to such portion
of the Escrow Shares.   Section 2.6 CONTINGENT SHARES. On each of the first
three anniversaries of the Closing Date, Finisar will issue and deliver to
the persons who held shares of Sensors Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, on a pro rata basis, shares of Finisar Common Stock (valued
on the basis of the average closing trading price per share of such stock on
the Nasdaq National Market (the "NNM") for the ten (10) trading days
preceding the applicable payment date) (the "Contingent Shares) as
follows:   (a) On the first anniversary of the Closing Date, if at least
75% of the key management and technical employees listed on SCHEDULE 2.6
hereto (the "Key Sensors Employees"), or equivalent replacement employees
reasonably acceptable to Finisar, are then employed by Finisar or a
Subsidiary of Finisar, Finisar will issue and deliver Contingent Shares
having an aggregate dollar value equal to $2.375 multiplied by the aggregate
number of Performance Shares, and rounded to the nearest whole share.   (b)
On the second anniversary of the Closing Date, if at least 65% of the Key
Sensors Employees, or equivalent replacement employees reasonably acceptable
to Finisar, are then employed by Finisar or a Subsidiary of Finisar, Finisar
will issue and deliver Contingent Shares having an aggregate dollar value
equal to $1.58333 multiplied by the aggregate number of Performance Shares,
and rounded to the nearest whole share.   (c) On the third anniversary of
the Closing Date, if at least 50% of the Key Sensors Employees, or equivalent
replacement employees reasonably acceptable to Finisar, are then employed by
Finisar or a Subsidiary of Finisar, and if prior to that date all six
Milestones have been achieved, Finisar will issue and deliver Contingent
Shares having an aggregate dollar value equal to $0.79167 multiplied by the
aggregate number of Performance Shares, and rounded to the nearest whole
share.   (d) The contingent right of the persons who held shares of
Sensors Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time to receive
Contingent Shares as set forth in this Section 2.6 will be neither negotiable
nor assignable, except by operation of law.   Section 2.7 DISSENTERS\'
RIGHTS. In the event the Merger becomes effective without the approval of the
holders of 100% of the outstanding shares of Sensors Common Stock, any shares
of Sensors Common Stock held by shareholders who properly exercise and
perfect the dissenters\' rights set forth in Section 14A:11 of the BCA
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted pursuant to Section 2.2, but
shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as
may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant
to the provisions of the BCA. Finisar shall have the right to control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to the determination of the fair
value of the Sensors Common Stock. Sensors agrees that, without the prior
written consent of Finisar or as required under the BCA, it will not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or determine or offer to
determine, the    8   fair value of the Sensors Common Stock. Each
holder of Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting Shareholder") who, pursuant to the
provisions of the BCA, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of
Sensors Common Stock shall receive payment therefor (but only after the fair
value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to
the provisions of the BCA). In the event that any holder of Sensors Common
Stock fails to make an effective demand for payment or otherwise loses his,
her or its status as a Dissenting Shareholder, Finisar shall, as of the later
of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, issue and deliver,
upon surrender by such Dissenting Shareholder of his, her or its
Certificate(s), the shares of Finisar Common Stock and cash, including any
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, in each case without interest
thereon, to which such Dissenting Shareholder would have been entitled under
Section 2.4.    ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
SENSORS   Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule provided to
Finisar on or before the date of this Agreement (the "Sensors Disclosure

properties and to carry on its business as currently being conducted and as
currently proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to transact
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its operations requires such qualification, except where the failure to so
qualify has not and will not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in
Section 10.2(a)) on Sensors. Sensors has delivered true and correct copies of
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Sensors, each as amended to
date, to Finisar. Sensors is not in violation of any of the provisions of its
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or other charter documents. Sensors does

Sensors Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully

Sensors Common Stock are reserved for issuance under the 1993 Stock Option
Plan, and 190,000 shares of Sensors Common Stock are reserved for issuance
under the Second Amended    9   and Restated 1997 Stock Option Plan, of

no equity securities of any class of Sensors, or any securities exchangeable
into or exercisable for such equity securities, issued, reserved for
issuance, or outstanding and (ii) no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, rights, or other commitments or agreements of any

agreements relating to voting, purchase or sale of Sensors\' capital stock
(i) between or among Sensors and any of its shareholders or (ii) to Sensors\'
knowledge, between or among any of Sensors\' shareholders.   Section 3.3
AUTHORITY; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS.   (a) Sensors has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all
other documents required to be executed and delivered by Sensors hereunder,
including the Agreement of Merger (collectively, the "Transaction

thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which Sensors is or will be a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Sensors,
subject only to the approval of the Merger by Sensors\' shareholders as
required by the BCA. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which Sensors is a party have been or will be duly executed and delivered by
Sensors and constitute or will constitute the valid and binding obligations
of Sensors, enforceable against Sensors in accordance with their respective
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors\' rights generally, and (ii) general principles of equity.   (b)
The execution and delivery by Sensors of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party do not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will
not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision
of, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Sensors, (ii) result in
any violation or breach of or constitute (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) a default under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or loss
of any material benefit under, any note, mortgage, indenture, lease, contract
or other agreement or obligation to which Sensors is a party or by which
Sensors or any of its properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) conflict
with or violate any material permit, concession, franchise, license,
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to Sensors or any of its properties or assets.    10    (c)
No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration
or filing with, any court, administrative agency or commission or other
governmental authority or instrumentality ("Governmental Entity") is required
by or with respect to Sensors in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except for (i) the filing of a pre-merger notification and report
form by the Company under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), (ii) the filing of the Agreement of Merger
and Officer\'s Certificates with the New Jersey Secretary of State in
accordance with the BCA, (iii) such consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required
under applicable federal and state securities laws, (iv) such filings as may
be required under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act ("ISRA"), and
(v) such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations
which, if not obtained or made, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Sensors and would not prevent or materially alter or delay any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 3.4 FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS. Sensors has delivered to Finisar (i) its audited financial
statements for each of the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, and (ii)
its unaudited financial statements, including statements of operations and
cash flows for the seven-month period ended July 31, 2000 and a balance sheet
as of July 31, 2000 (the "Balance Sheet Date") (collectively, the "Sensors
Financial Statements"). The Sensors Financial Statements were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods involved, except that the unaudited
Sensors Financial Statements do not contain footnotes. The Sensors Financial
Statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of
Sensors as of the respective dates and the results of its operations and cash
flows for the periods indicated, subject, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments. Sensors maintains, and
until the Effective Time will continue to maintain, a standard system of
accounting established and administered in accordance with GAAP.   Section
3.5 ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Sensors does not have any
liabilities, either accrued or contingent (whether or not required to
be reflected in financial statements in accordance with GAAP), and whether
due or to become due, other than (i) liabilities reflected or provided for on
the balance sheet as of the Balance Sheet Date (the "Sensors Balance
Sheet") contained in the Sensors Financial Statements, (ii) liabilities
contemplated by this Agreement or described in the Sensors Disclosure
Schedule, and (iii) normal or recurring liabilities incurred since the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices.   Section 3.6 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. The accounts receivable shown
on the Sensors Balance Sheet arose in the ordinary course of business and
have been collected or are collectible in the book amounts thereof, less an
amount not in excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns
provided for in the Sensors Balance Sheet. The accounts receivable of Sensors
arising after the Balance Sheet Date and prior to the Closing Date arose, or
will arise, in the ordinary course of business and have been collected or
will be collectible in the book amounts thereof, less allowances for
doubtful accounts and returns determined in accordance with GAAP and the
past practices of Sensors. None of such accounts receivable is subject to
any claim of offset or recoupment or counterclaim, and Sensors has no
knowledge of any specific facts that would be likely to give rise to any such
claim. No amount of such accounts receivable is    11   contingent upon
the performance by Sensors of any obligation and no agreement for deduction
or discount has been made with respect to any such accounts receivable.  
Section 3.7 INVENTORIES. The inventories shown on the Sensors Balance Sheet
or thereafter acquired by Sensors consist of items of a quantity and quality
usable or salable in the ordinary course of business. Since the Balance Sheet
Date, Sensors has continued to replenish inventories in a normal and
customary manner consistent with past practices. Sensors has not received
notice that it will experience in the foreseeable future any difficulty in
obtaining, in the desired quantity and quality and at a reasonable price and
upon reasonable terms and conditions, the supplies or component products
required for the manufacture, assembly or production of its products. The
value at which inventories are carried reflect the inventory valuation policy
of Sensors, which is consistent with its past practice and in accordance with
GAAP. Due provision has been made on the books of Sensors, consistent with
past practices, to provide for all slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable
inventories at their estimated useful or scrap values, and such inventory
reserves are adequate to provide for such slow-moving, obsolete or unusable
inventory and inventory shrinkage.   Section 3.8 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES
OR EVENTS. Since the Balance Sheet Date, Sensors has conducted its business
in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practices and,
since such date, Sensors has not:   (a) suffered any event or occurrence
that has had a Material Adverse Effect on Sensors;   (b) suffered any
damage, destruction or loss, whether covered by insurance or not, having a
material adverse effect on its properties or business;   (c) granted any
material increase in the compensation payable or to become payable by Sensors
to its officers or employees;   (d) declared, set aside or paid any dividend
or made any other distribution on or in respect of the shares of its capital
stock or declared any direct or indirect redemption, retirement, purchase or
other acquisition of such shares;   (e) issued any shares of its capital
stock or any warrants, rights, or options for, or entered into any commitment
relating to such capital stock, other than shares of Sensors Common Stock

methods or practices it follows, whether for general financial or tax

asset;   (i) entered into any material commitment or transaction

liability, except in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice;   (k) permitted or allowed any of its property or assets to

to property, plant or equipment individually in excess of $100,000, or, in
the aggregate, in excess of $250,000;   (m) paid, loaned or advanced any
amount to, or sold, transferred or leased any properties or assets to, or
entered into any agreement or arrangement with, any of its officers,
directors or shareholders or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, other

related business expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business;  
(n) agreed to take any action described in this Section 3.8 or which would
constitute a breach of any of the representations or warranties of Sensors
contained in this Agreement; or   (o) taken any other action that would have
required the consent of Finisar pursuant to Section 5.1 of this Agreement

this Agreement.   Section 3.9 TAXES.   (a) For purposes of this Agreement,
a "Tax" or, collectively, "Taxes," means any and all federal, state and local

applicable law, and Sensors has disclosed on its Returns all positions taken

Sensors, as of the Closing Date, (i) will have paid all Taxes it is required
to pay prior to the Closing Date and (ii) will have withheld with respect to
its employees all Taxes required to be withheld.   (d) Sensors has not been

or assessed or proposed against Sensors that is not reflected as a liability
on the Sensors Balance Sheet or set forth on the Sensors Disclosure Schedule,
nor has Sensors executed any agreements or waivers extending any statute of
limitations on or extending the period for the assessment or collection of
any Tax.   (e) The amount of Sensors\' liability for unpaid Taxes
(whether actual or contingent) for all periods through the date hereof and
the Closing Date does not and will not, in the aggregate, exceed the amount
of the current liability accruals for Taxes (excluding reserves for deferred
Taxes) reflected on the Sensors Balance Sheet (other than Taxes which have

or arrangement, including but not limited to the provisions of this
Agreement, covering any employee or former employee of Sensors that,

that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G, 404 or 162(m) of the
Code by Sensors or Sub as an expense under applicable law.   (l) Sensors
has not constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of this

a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.    14    (m) Sensors
has not agreed to make, nor is it required to make, any adjustment under

been, a "reporting corporation" subject to the information reporting and

of any sort (collectively, "Liens") on the assets of Sensors relating to or
attributable to Taxes, other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable.   (r) Sensors (and any predecessor of Sensors) has been a
validly existing S corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362
of the Code and comparable provisions of all relevant state laws at all times
during its existence, and Sensors will be an S corporation up to and
including the day before the Closing Date.   Section 3.10 TANGIBLE ASSETS
AND REAL PROPERTY.   (a) Sensors owns or leases all tangible assets and
properties which are material to the conduct of its business as currently
conducted or which are reflected on the Sensors Balance Sheet or acquired
since the Balance Sheet Date (the "Material Tangible Assets"). The Material
Tangible Assets are in good operating condition and repair. Sensors has good
and marketable title to all Material Tangible Assets that it owns (except
properties, interests in properties and assets sold or otherwise disposed of
since the Sensors Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business),
free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens for current taxes not yet due
and payable. Assuming the due execution and delivery thereof by the other

enforceable and grants Sensors such rights to such intellectual property as
are necessary to the business of Sensors as currently conducted or currently
proposed to be conducted.   (b) The Sensors Disclosure Schedule contains an
accurate and complete list of (i) all patents, patent applications,

Sensors\' business), (iv) all joint development agreements to which Sensors
is a party, and (v) all agreements with Governmental Entities or other third
parties pursuant to which Sensors has obtained funding for research and
development activities.   (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement,
compliance with its terms and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) or give rise to any right, license or Lien relating to any Sensors
Intellectual Property Rights, or right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any Sensors Intellectual Property Rights, or the loss or
encumbrance of any Sensors Intellectual Property Rights or material benefit
related thereto, or result in or require the creation, imposition or
extension of any Lien upon any Sensors Intellectual Property Rights or
otherwise impair the right of Sensors or its customers to use the Sensors
Intellectual Property Rights in the same manner as such Sensors Intellectual
Property Rights are currently being used by Sensors or the customers of
Sensors.   (d) All patents and registered trademarks, service marks
and copyrights issued to Sensors which relate to any Sensors Product are
valid and subsisting. The manufacturing,    16   marketing, licensing
or sale of any Sensors Product does not infringe any patent, trademark, trade
name, service mark, copyright, mask work right, trade secret or other
proprietary right of any third party. Sensors (i) has not received notice

claim of infringement of any patent, trademark, trade name, service mark,
copyright, mask work right, trade secret or other proprietary right of any
third party and (ii) has no knowledge of any claim challenging or questioning
the validity or effectiveness of any license or agreement relating to any
Sensors Intellectual Property Rights or Licensed Intellectual Property. There
is no outstanding order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment or stipulation by

patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, trade name, mask work right or
other claims relating to the Sensors Intellectual Property Rights to which
Sensors is a party or by which it is bound.   (e) All designs, drawings,
specifications, source code, object code, documentation, flow charts and
diagrams incorporated, embodied or reflected in any Sensors Product at any
stage of its development were written, developed and created solely and
exclusively by (i) employees of Sensors without the assistance of any third
party or (ii) third parties who assigned ownership of their rights with
respect thereto to Sensors by means of valid and enforceable agreements,
which are listed and described in the Sensors Disclosure Schedule and copies
of which have been provided to Finisar. Sensors has at all times used
commercially reasonable efforts to protect its trade secrets. None of the
trade secrets of Sensors have been published or disclosed by Sensors or, to
the knowledge of Sensors, by any other person, to any person except pursuant
to licenses or contracts requiring such other persons to keep such trade
secrets confidential.   (f) Sensors is not, and, to the knowledge of

Sensors (including consultants and independent contractors, if any) that has
or had access to confidential information of Sensors has executed and
delivered to Sensors a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement in one of
the forms previously provided to Finisar. Neither the    17   execution
or delivery of any such agreement by any such person, nor the carrying on by
any such person, as an employee, consultant or independent contractor, of
Sensors\' business as currently conducted and as currently proposed to be
conducted, has or will conflict with or result in a breach of the terms,
conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any contract,
covenant or instrument under which any of such persons is obligated.

(b) To Sensors\' knowledge, no party to any such contract, agreement or
instrument intends to cancel, withdraw, modify or amend such

shall afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of Finisar, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, Sensors
shall furnish promptly to Finisar or its representatives all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
party may reasonably request. Unless otherwise required by law, the parties
will treat any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in
accordance with the Nondisclosure Agreement effective as of April 5, 2000
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") between Finisar and Sensors, which
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.  
Section 6.4 LEGAL CONDITIONS TO MERGER. Each of Finisar and Sensors will take
all reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all
legal requirements which may be imposed on itself with respect to the Merger
(which actions shall include, without limitation, furnishing all information
in connection with approvals of or filings with any Governmental Entity)
and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to each other
in connection with any such requirements imposed upon either of them or any
of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger. Each of Finisar and
Sensors will take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will
cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity or other third
party, required to be obtained or made by Sensors, Finisar or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action
contemplated thereby or by this Agreement and to enable the Closing to occur
as promptly as practicable.   Section 6.5 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Finisar and
Sensors shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by law or by
the rules or regulations of the SEC or the NNM.   Section 6.6 TAX-FREE
REORGANIZATION. Finisar and Sensors each intend that the Merger shall qualify
for treatment as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Finisar and Sensors each agree to refrain from taking any action
inconsistent with such intended treatment. Finisar and Sensors agree to make,
and Sensors agrees to use its best efforts to cause its shareholders to make,
reasonable representations as requested by counsel to Finisar and Sensors
with respect to the rendering of the opinions required pursuant to Section
7.1(e).    30    Section 6.7 NASDAQ QUOTATION. Finisar agrees to
continue the quotation of Finisar Common Stock on the NNM during the term of
this Agreement. Finisar shall use its best efforts to cause the shares of
Finisar Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for quotation
on the NNM, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing
Date.   Section 6.8 SECURITIES LAW MATTERS.   (a) As soon as practicable
following the execution of this Agreement, Finisar will file a request for a
hearing (the "Hearing") before the Commissioner of Corporations of the State
of California to consider the terms, conditions and fairness of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Section 25142 of the
California Corporations Code, together with an application for a permit
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Agreement
of Merger (the "Permit"). Sensors and the Principal Shareholders shall
promptly furnish to Finisar all data and information relating to Sensors and
the Principal Shareholders as may be necessary in connection with such
request and application and such other notices and documents as may be
required in connection with the Hearing. Finisar, Sensors and the Principal
Shareholders shall use their respective best efforts to cause the Hearing to
take place and the Permit to be issued at the earliest practicable date.  
(b) Finisar shall prepare and file with appropriate state securities or "Blue
Sky" authorities all applications for qualification or approval (or notices
required to perfect exemptions from such compliance) as may be required in
connection with the Merger. Sensors and the Principal Shareholders shall use
their respective best efforts to assist Finisar as may be necessary to comply
with all appropriate state securities or Blue Sky laws which may be
applicable in connection with the Merger.   (c) In connection with the
Hearing, Sensors shall prepare, with the cooperation of Finisar, a Consent
Solicitation Statement describing this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby for the purpose of soliciting the approval of
Sensors Shareholders. Finisar shall provide such information about itself as
Sensors shall reasonably request. The information supplied by Sensors for
inclusion in the Consent Solicitation Statement shall not, on the date the
solicitation statement is first mailed to Sensors Shareholders or at the
Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time, is false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or omit to state any
material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
which has become false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sensors
makes no representation, warranty or covenant with respect to any information
supplied by Finisar or Sub which is contained in any of the foregoing
documents. The information supplied by Finisar for inclusion in the
solicitation statement shall not, on the date the solicitation statement is
first mailed to Sensors\' shareholders, nor at the Effective Time, contain
any statement which, at such time, is false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which it is made,
not false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier communication which has become false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Finisar and Sub make no
representation, warranty or    31   covenant with respect to any
information supplied by Sensors which is contained in any of the foregoing
documents.   (d) The Consent Solicitation Statement shall constitute
a disclosure document for the offer and issuance of shares of Finisar
Common Stock to be received by the holders of Sensors Common Stock in the
Merger. Finisar and Sensors shall each use reasonable commercial efforts to
cause the Consent Solicitation Statement to comply with applicable federal
and state securities laws requirements. Each of Finisar and Sensors agrees to
provide promptly to the other such information concerning its business and
financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the
providing party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate for inclusion
in the solicitation statement or in any amendments or supplements thereto,
and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the other\'s counsel
and auditors in the preparation of the solicitation statement. Sensors
will promptly advise Finisar, and Finisar will promptly advise Sensors, in
writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time either Sensors or Finisar
shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or
appropriate to amend or supplement the solicitation statement in order to
make the statements contained or incorporated by reference therein not
misleading or to comply with applicable law. The solicitation statement shall
contain the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of Sensors
that the Sensors shareholders approve the Merger and this Agreement and the
unanimous conclusion of the Board of Directors that the terms and conditions
of the Merger are fair and reasonable to the shareholders of Sensors.
Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, Sensors shall not
include in the solicitation statement any information with respect to Finisar
or its affiliates or associates, the form and content of which information
shall not have been approved by Finisar prior to such inclusion.   (e) Upon
receipt of the Permit, Sensors shall, as promptly as possible but not later
than three (3) days following the effectiveness of the Permit, submit this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to the Sensors
shareholders for approval and adoption as provided by New Jersey law and its
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Sensors shall use its best efforts
to solicit and obtain the consent of the Sensors shareholders sufficient to
approve the Merger and this Agreement and to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable and, in any event, on or before November 30, 2000.
Sensors shall ensure that the meeting of the Sensors shareholders called for
the purpose of approving the Merger and this Agreement, or the solicitation
of written consents of the Sensors shareholders without a meeting, is
conducted, and that all proxies solicited by Sensors in connection with any
such meeting are solicited, in compliance with applicable law and the Sensors
charter documents. Sensors\' obligation to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the shareholders\' meeting, or to solicit the written consent of its
shareholders without a meeting, in accordance with this Section 6.8(e) shall
not be limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to Sensors of any Sensors Acquisition
Proposal.   (f) SCHEDULE 6.8(f) sets forth those persons who, in
Sensors\' reasonable judgment are or may be "affiliates" of Sensors within
the meaning of Rule 145 (each such person a "Sensors Affiliate"). Sensors
shall provide Finisar such information and documents as Finisar shall
reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. Sensors shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to Finisar, promptly following the execution of this
Agreement (and in any case prior to the Closing) from each of the Sensors
Affiliates, an executed Affiliate Agreement in the form   
32   attached hereto as EXHIBIT C. Finisar shall be entitled to place
appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any Finisar Common Stock
to be received by such Sensors Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the
transfer agent for Finisar Common Stock, consistent with the terms of such
Affiliate Agreements.   Section 6.9 HSR ACT. Finisar and Sensors shall
promptly prepare and file Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act
with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division"), and respond as promptly
as practicable to all inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust
Division for additional information or documentation.   Section 6.10
EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.   (a) Effective on the Closing Date, Gregory H. Olsen
will become an employee of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the terms of
an Employment Agreement in the form of EXHIBIT D-1 hereto, and each of the
other Principal Shareholders, and Chris Dries, Holly M. Dansbury, Michael J.
Lange and Alan R. Sugg will become employees of the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to the terms of Employment Agreements substantially in the form of
EXHIBIT D-2 hereto (collectively, the "Employment Agreements").   (b) Prior
to the Closing Date, Finisar will make offers of "at will" employment (on
behalf of the Surviving Corporation) to all employees of Sensors recommended
by the Chief Executive Officer of Sensors and set forth on SCHEDULE 6.10(b)
hereto, such offers to be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.
All Sensors employees whose employment will not be continued by the Surviving
Corporation will be terminated by Sensors prior to the Closing Date.  
Section 6.11 STOCK OPTIONS.   (a) Holders of outstanding, vested Sensors
Options (including options that vest due to the Merger) may elect to either
(i) exercise such options prior to the Closing and receive the Firm Merger
Shares (or Cash Merger Consideration in lieu of a portion thereof) and the
Performance Shares in the same manner and at the same time as other Sensors
Shareholders or (ii) not exercise such options prior to the Closing and
instead have Finisar assume their outstanding and unexercised Sensors Options
and convert them into options to purchase Finisar Common Stock, as set forth
in Section 6.11(b) below.   (b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Sensors Option which has not been exercised prior to the Closing, whether
vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Finisar and converted into an option
(an "Assumed Option") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Sensors Option (except as otherwise provided below),
such number of shares of Finisar Common Stock equal to the number of Firm
Merger Shares and Performance Shares which the holder of such Sensors Option
would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger (assuming the
issuance of all Performance Shares) had such holder exercised such option in
full immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest
whole share), at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to (i) the aggregate exercise    33   price of the Sensors Common
Stock purchasable pursuant to such Sensors Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (ii) the number of full shares of Finisar Common
Stock purchasable pursuant to the Assumed Option. The vesting schedule of
each Assumed Option shall be structured such that each Assumed Option shall
initially be vested to the extent of the greater of (i) 25% of the total
number of shares subject to the Assumed Option or (ii) the vested percentage
of the original Sensors Option at the Closing, but in no event greater than
50% of the total number of shares subject to the Assumed Option, and the
remainder shall vest in three approximately equal annual installments on each
of the first three anniversaries of the Closing Date, subject in each case to
the holder\'s continued service with Finisar or a Subsidiary thereof. The
vesting of the Assumed Options will not be subject to acceleration upon
future events, except for (x) events that cause the acceleration of options
then outstanding under Finisar\'s stock option plans or (y) the holder\'s
death or permanent disability, the involuntary termination of the holder\'s
employment without cause or, in the case of the Principal Shareholders, the
voluntary termination of such Principal Shareholder\'s employment for "Good
Reason," as defined in such Principal Shareholder\'s Employment
Agreement.   (c) As soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, Sensors shall deliver to the holders of the Sensors Options an
appropriate notice setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant thereto and
the right of the holders to make the election set forth in Section 6.11(a)
above. Each Assumed Option shall be evidenced by a written assumption
agreement reflecting the terms set forth in Section 6.11(b) and delivered to
the former holders of Sensors Options promptly following the Effective Time.
Finisar shall, to the extent required by and subject to the provisions of the
Sensors Option Plan, take such actions as may be appropriate under the Code
and the regulations thereunder to cause the Assumed Options representing
assumed Sensors Options which qualified as incentive stock options
immediately prior the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock
options after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted under the Code and
the regulations thereunder.   (d) Finisar shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Finisar
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Assumed Options. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Finisar shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with
respect to the shares of Finisar Common Stock subject to the Assumed Options
and shall use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses in connection therewith) for so long
as any Assumed Options remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals
who, subsequent to the Merger, will be subject to the reporting requirements
under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Finisar shall
administer the Assumed Options in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.   (e) In addition to the Sensors
Options assumed by Finisar in the Merger, Finisar shall grant to all Sensors
employees who remain employed at the Closing new options, under Finisar\'s
employee stock option plan, to purchase shares of Finisar Common Stock in the
amounts set forth on SCHEDULE 6.11(e) hereto.   Section 6.12 EMPLOYEE STOCK
PURCHASE PLAN. Employees of Sensors as of the Effective Time shall be
permitted to participate in the Finisar Employee Stock Purchase Plan
commencing    34   on the first enrollment date following the Effective
Time, subject to compliance with the eligibility provisions of such plan.

Finisar, Sensors or any other Subsidiary of Finisar following the Effective
Time shall be entitled to participate in all employee benefit plans and
programs (the "Finisar Plans") that are available to other Finisar employees
holding comparable positions. To the extent permitted by the Finisar Plans,
each participant shall be given full credit for such participant\'s period of
continuous service with Sensors prior to the Effective Time. To the extent
permitted by law, Finisar shall amend the Finisar Plans, as necessary, to
provide for such participation. In the case of medical and health insurance
coverage, Finisar shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to insure
Sensors employees under Sensors\' existing insurance plans or provide them
with the opportunity to participate in Finisar Plans providing generally
comparable medical and health insurance coverage.   Section 6.14 EMPLOYEE
RETENTION POOL. Finisar shall establish a pool of cash in the aggregate
amount of $2,000,000 (the "Retention Pool") for retention of Sensors
employees. The Retention Pool shall be allocated among the employees listed
on SCHEDULE 6.11(e) hereto (excluding Gregory H. Olsen) in proportion to
their current base salary as set forth on a list to be delivered by Sensors
to Finisar prior to the Closing. One-fourth of the amount allocated to each
eligible employee will vest at the Effective Time provided such eligible
employee accepts continued employment with the Surviving Corporation and will
be payable on the next regular payroll date thereafter. Eligible employees
will vest in the remaining amount allocated to them in equal installments on
the first, second and third anniversaries of the Closing Date, subject to
their continued employment by Finisar or a Subsidiary of Finisar.   Section
6.15 SENSORS 401(k) PLAN. Sensors agrees to terminate its 401(k) plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless Finisar, in its sole
and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain such plan by
providing Sensors with written notice of such election at least three (3)
days before the Closing Date. Unless Finisar provides such notice, Sensors
shall deliver to Finisar evidence that Sensors\' 401(k) plan has been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of Sensors\' Board of Directors (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Finisar), effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.  
Section 6.16 BROKERS OR FINDERS. Each of Finisar and Sensors represents, as
to itself, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, that no agent,
broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person is or
will be entitled to any broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any other commission or
similar fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except Broadview International, financial advisor to Finisar,
to which Finisar has agreed to pay fees and expenses in connection
with financial advisory services, and Quantum Leap Institute LLC
("QLI"), financial advisor to Sensors, and QLI\'s consultant, RHK, Inc., to
which Sensors has agreed to pay fees and expenses in connection with
financial advisory services, and each of Finisar and Sensors agrees to
indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims,
liabilities or obligations with respect to any other fees, commissions or
expenses asserted by any person on the basis of any act or statement alleged
to have been made by such party or its Affiliate.    35    Section 6.17
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS; REASONABLE EFFORTS. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including cooperating fully with
the other party, including by provision of information. In case at any time
after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the proper officers and
directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary
action.   Section 6.18 EXPENSES. The parties shall each pay their own
legal, accounting, financial advisory and consulting fees and other out-of-
pocket expenses related to the negotiation, preparation and carrying out of
this Agreement and the transactions herein contemplated. In the event the
Merger is consummated all legal, accounting, financial advisory and
consulting fees and expenses incurred by Sensors (whether paid or accrued)
relating to the negotiation, preparation and carrying out of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and obtaining all authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals of, or declarations or filings with, all
Governmental Entities in connection with such transactions (the "Sensors
Transaction Expenses") shall be borne by the former security holders of
Sensors, as hereinafter provided. Filing fees and other fees payable to
Governmental Entities shall not be deemed to be Sensors Transaction Expenses.
SCHEDULE 6.18 hereto sets forth Sensors\' current estimate of the total
Sensors Transaction Expenses which Sensors expects to incur (the "Estimated
Sensors Transaction Expenses"). Sensors shall provide an updated schedule
of Estimated Sensors Transaction Expenses not later than two (2) business
days prior to the Closing (the "Closing Sensors Transaction Expense
Schedule"). The amount of Sensors Transaction Expenses set forth on the
Closing Sensors Transaction Expense Schedule shall be used to calculate the
Total Stock Consideration as defined in Section 2.1(r). In the event the
Sensors Transaction Expenses actually incurred by Sensors exceed the amount
shown on the Closing Sensors Transaction Expense Schedule, Finisar shall be
entitled to assert a claim against the Escrow Shares pursuant to Article XI
hereof in order to recover all such additional expenses.   Section 6.19

have been issued, nor shall any proceeding brought by any Governmental

Merger illegal.   (e) Finisar shall have received a written opinion from

breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
the other party set forth in this Agreement, which breach (i) causes the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b) (in the case of termination by
Finisar) or 7.3(a) or (b) (in the case of termination by Sensors) not to be
satisfied and (ii) shall not have been cured within ten (10) business days
following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach
from the other party.   Section 8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Finisar, Sensors, Sub or their
respective officers, directors, shareholders or Affiliates, except to the
extent that such termination results from the willful breach by a party of
any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this
Agreement; provided that the provisions of Sections 6.16, 6.18 and 8.3 of
this Agreement, the confidentiality provisions set forth herein and in
the Confidentiality Agreement and the non-solicitation provisions set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and survive any termination of this Agreement.   Section 8.3 TERMINATION
FEE. In the event that (i) Finisar should determine that any approval by its
stockholders is required in connection with the consummation of the
Merger,    40   (ii) such approval is not obtained, (iii) this Agreement
is terminated as a result of Finisar\'s failure to obtain such approval and
(iv) immediately prior to such termination, Sensors was not in breach of any
of its material obligations hereunder (which breach shall not have been cured
within ten (10) business days following receipt by Sensors of notice of such
breach), then Finisar shall pay to Sensors a termination fee of $17,000,000,
payable within thirty (30) days following the termination of this
Agreement.   Section 8.4 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented
in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Sensors, but, after
any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires
further approval by such shareholders without such further approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.   Section 8.5 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At
any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent

obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party.   ARTICLE IX  
ESCROW AND INDEMNIFICATION    Section 9.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES. If the Merger occurs, all of the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date (except that
representations and warranties that specifically relate to a particular date
or period shall be true and correct as of such date and for such period) and
shall continue in full force and effect for the period ending on the date
that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date (the "Termination
Date").   Section 9.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS.   (a)
Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, each of the Principal
Shareholders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Finisar, its officers,
directors, employees and attorneys, all Subsidiaries and Affiliates of
Finisar, and the respective officers, directors, employees and attorneys of
such entities (all such persons and entities being collectively referred to
as the "Finisar Group") from, against, for and in respect of any and all
losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) which any member of the Finisar Group may sustain or incur which
are caused by or arise out of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants made by Sensors or the
Principal Shareholders in this Agreement, including the Sensors Disclosure
Schedule, (ii) any Sensors Transaction Expenses in excess of the amount set
forth on the Closing Sensors Transaction Expense Schedule and reflected in
the calculation of the Total Stock Consideration,    41   or (iii) any
breach by the Principal Shareholders of this Article IX or the Escrow
Agreement (collectively, "Finisar Losses").   (b) No Principal Shareholder
shall be required to indemnify any member of the Finisar Group for any
Finisar Losses until the aggregate amount of all Finisar Losses under all
claims shall exceed $250,000 (the "Deductible Amount"); provided, however,
that Finisar Losses under Section 9.2(a)(ii) shall be recoverable in full
without regard to the Deductible Amount. Except as specifically provided in
Section 9.2(d), the maximum aggregate liability of any individual Principal
Shareholder pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall in no event exceed the value of
the one-third of the Escrow Shares that otherwise would have been deliverable
to such Principal Shareholder on the third anniversary of the Closing Date
pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof (assuming four of the Milestones have been
achieved by the second anniversary of the Closing Date and all six Milestones
have been achieved by the third anniversary of the Closing Date), and the
indemnification payment to be made on behalf of each such Principal
Shareholder shall be withheld only from such portion of the Escrow
Shares.   (c) The obligation of the Principal Shareholders to
indemnify members of the Finisar Group for a Finisar Loss under this Article
IX is subject to the condition that the Shareholders\' Representative (as
defined in Section 9.6) shall have received written notice of an
Indemnification Claim (as defined in Section 9.3) for such Finisar Loss on or
before the Termination Date.   (d) The provisions of Section 9.2(b) above
and 9.5 below shall not limit, in any manner, (i) any remedy at law or in
equity to which any member of the Finisar Group shall be entitled against
Sensors or any shareholder of Sensors as a result of willful fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by Sensors, any shareholder of Sensors or any
of their respective representatives, or (ii) any rights that Finisar may have
under federal or state securities laws.   (e) The amount of Finisar Losses
shall be computed after giving effect to the receipt of any insurance
proceeds and tax benefits with respect thereto.   Section 9.3 PROCEDURES
FOR INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) As used in this Article IX, the term "Indemnitee"
means the member or members of the Finisar Group seeking indemnification
hereunder.   (b) A claim for indemnification hereunder (an
"Indemnification Claim") shall be made by Indemnitee by delivery of a written
notice to the Representative and the Escrow Agent requesting indemnification
and specifying in reasonable detail the basis on which indemnification is
sought (and shall include relevant documentation related to the
Indemnification Claim), the amount of the asserted Finisar Losses and, in the
case of a Third Party Claim (as defined in Section 9.4), containing (by
attachment or otherwise) such other information as Indemnitee shall have
concerning such Third Party Claim.   (c) If the Indemnification Claim
involves a Third Party Claim, the procedures set forth in Section 9.4 hereof
shall be observed by Indemnitee and the Representative.    42   
Section 9.4 DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. Should any claim be made or suit
or proceeding be instituted against an Indemnitee which, if
prosecuted successfully, would be a matter for which such Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification under this Article IX (a "Third Party Claim"),
the obligations and liabilities of the parties hereunder with respect to
such Third Party Claim shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:   (a) Indemnitee shall give the Representative and the Escrow
Agent written notice of any such Third Party Claim promptly after receipt
by Indemnitee of notice thereof, and the Representative may, subject to
the prior written consent of Finisar, undertake control of the defense
thereof by counsel of his own choosing reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee.
Indemnitee may participate in the defense through its own counsel at its own
expense. If, however, the Representative fails or refuses to undertake the
defense of such Third Party Claim within fifteen (15) days after written
notice of such claim has been delivered to the Representative by Indemnitee,
Indemnitee shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise and,
subject to Section 9.5, settlement of such Third Party Claim with counsel of
its own choosing. In the circumstances described in the preceding
sentence, Indemnitee shall, promptly upon its assumption of the defense of
such Third Party Claim, make an Indemnification Claim as specified in Section
9.3(b), which shall be deemed an Indemnification Claim that is not a Third
Party Claim for the purposes of the procedures set forth herein. Failure
of Indemnitee to furnish written notice to the Representative or the
Escrow Agent of a Third Party Claim shall not release the Principal
Shareholders from their obligations hereunder, except to the extent they are
prejudiced by such failure.   (b) Indemnitee and the Representative shall
cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the
defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available records relating
to such claim and furnishing employees of Indemnitee as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of any such Third Party Claim or
for testimony as witness in any proceeding relating to such claim.   (c)
Unless the Representative has failed to fulfill its obligations under this
Article IX, no settlement by Indemnitee of a Third Party Claim shall be made
without the prior written consent by or on behalf of the Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the
Representative has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim as contemplated
by this Section 9.4, no settlement of such Third Party Claim may be made by
the Representative (or the individual Principal Shareholder as the case may
be) without the prior written consent by or on behalf of Indemnitee, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   Section 9.5 MANNER
OF INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) The portion of the Escrow Shares specified in
Section 9.2(b), deposited into Escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5, shall provide a fund against
which members of the Finisar Group may assert claims of indemnification under
this Article IX. Except as specifically provided in Section 9.2(d), the sole
recourse of any member of the Finisar Group for such indemnification claims
is to the portion of the Escrow Shares specified in Section 9.2(b).   
43    (b) Each claim for indemnification asserted against the
Principal Shareholders pursuant to this Article IX shall be made only in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement, subject to
the provisions of Section 9.2(d) hereof.   Section 9.6 APPOINTMENT OF
SHAREHOLDERS\' REPRESENTATIVE. For purposes of this Agreement, the Principal
Shareholders hereby consent to the appointment of Gregory H. Olsen as the
representative and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Principal
Shareholders (the "Shareholders\' Representative"), and to the taking by the
Shareholders\' Representative of any and all actions and the making of any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by him under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, the exercise of the
power to (i) execute the Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Principal
Shareholders, (ii) authorize delivery to Finisar of Escrow Shares in
satisfaction of Indemnification Claims, (iii) agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such Indemnification Claims, (iv) resolve any
Indemnification Claims and (v) take all actions necessary in the judgment of
the Shareholders\' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing and
all of the other terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. Accordingly, the Shareholders\' Representative has
unlimited authority and power to act on behalf of each Principal Shareholder
with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the disposition,
settlement or other handling of all Indemnification Claims, rights or
obligations arising from and taken pursuant to this Agreement. The Principal
Shareholders will be bound by all actions taken by the Shareholders\'
Representative in connection with this Agreement, and Finisar shall be
entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Shareholders\'
Representative. The Shareholders\' Representative will incur no liability
with respect to any action taken or suffered by him in reliance upon any
notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed
by him to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper person (and shall
have no responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any
other action or inaction, except his own willful misconduct or bad faith. In
all questions arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the
Representative may rely on the advice of counsel, and the
Shareholders\' Representative will not be liable to anyone for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Shareholders\' Representative based
on such advice. Except as expressly provided herein, the Shareholders\'
Representative will not be required to take any action involving any expense
unless the payment of such expense is made or provided for in a manner
satisfactory to him. At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement,
holders of a majority of the Escrow Shares subject to Indemnification Claims
under this Article IX may, by written consent, appoint a new representative
as the Shareholders\' Representative by sending notice and a copy of the
written consent appointing such new representative signed by holders of a
majority of the Escrow Shares to Finisar and the Escrow Agent. Such
appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the
consent or the date such consent is received by Finisar and the Escrow
Agent.   ARTICLE X   GENERAL PROVISIONS   Section 10.1 NOTICES. All
