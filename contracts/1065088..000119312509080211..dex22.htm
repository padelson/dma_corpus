There are no unsatisfied liabilities for Taxes with respect to any notice of
deficiency or similar document received by the Company with respect to Taxes
in an amount greater than KRW 100,000,000 or, when added to all such other
unsatisfied liabilities, greater than KRW 100,000,000 (other than liabilities
for Taxes asserted under any such notice of deficiency or similar document
which  



 

8\. Confidential

  

 

 are being contested in good faith by the Company and with respect to which
adequate reserves for payment have been established on the Company Balance
Sheet). There are no liens or other Encumbrances upon any of the assets of
the Company for Taxes in an amount greater than KRW 100,000,000 or, when added
to all such other liens or Encumbrances, greater than KRW 500,000,000, except
liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable and liens for which adequate
reserves for payment have been established on the Company Balance Sheet.

(e) No written notice has ever been delivered by any Governmental Body to the
Company in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file a Tax Return that
claims that the Company is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction
which has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in an obligation
to pay Taxes in an amount greater than KRW 100,000,000.

(f) There are no Contracts relating to allocating or sharing of Taxes to
which the Company is a party. The Company is not: (i) liable for Taxes of any
other Person pursuant to any Contract or any Legal Requirement; (ii) currently
under any contractual obligation to indemnify any Person with respect to any
amounts of such Persons Taxes (except for customary agreements to indemnify
lenders or security holders in respect of Taxes); or (iii) a party to any
Contract providing for payments by the Company with respect to any amount of
Taxes of any other Person.

(g) The Company has maintained necessary records to enable it to comply in
all material respects with its obligations under any applicable Legal
Requirement relating to Taxes to: (i) prepare and submit any material
information, notices, computations, returns and payments; and (ii) prepare
any accounts. The Company has made available to the Purchaser accurate and

(h) The Company has withheld in all material respects from each payment or
deemed payment made to Company Associates or to its past or present suppliers,
creditors, shareholders or other third parties all Taxes and other deductions
required to be withheld, and has, within the time and in the manner required
by applicable Legal Requirements, paid such withheld amounts to the proper
Governmental Bodies.

2.15 Employee and Labor Matters; Benefit Plans.

(a) The Company has performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under each Company Employee Plan and Company
Employee Agreement, and each Company Employee Plan and Company Employee
Agreement has been established and maintained in all material respects in
accordance with its terms, with customary practices and with all applicable
Legal Requirements. The Company has made all contributions and other payments
required by and due under the terms of each Company Employee Plan and any
Legal Requirement.

(b) No Company Employee Plan is a funded plan within the meaning of such term
under the laws of the United States. The liability of each insurer for any
Company Employee Plan funded through insurance (if any), or the book reserve
established for any Company Employee Plan (if any), together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide in full for the accrued
benefit obligations, with respect to all current and former participants in
such Company Employee Plan according to the reasonable actuarial assumptions
and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to and
obligations under such Company Employee Plan, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not cause any such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than any such benefit obligations. There are no
liabilities of the Company with respect to any Company Employee Plan that are
not properly accrued and reflected in the financial statements of the Company
in accordance with Korean GAAP.



 

9\. Confidential

  

 

(c) The Company does not maintain, sponsor or contribute to any Company
Employee Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan and that is, in whole
or in part, self-funded or self-insured. No Company Employee Plan provides
(except at no cost to the Company), or reflects or represents any liability of
the Company to provide, post-termination or retiree life insurance, post-
termination or retiree health benefits or other post-termination or retiree
employee welfare benefits to any Person for any reason, except as may be
required by applicable Legal Requirements. Other than commitments made that
involve no future costs to the Company, the Company has never represented,
promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Company
Associate (either individually or to Company Associates as a group) or any
other Person that such Company Associate(s) or other Person would be provided
with post-termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree
health benefit or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits,
except to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements.

(d) Except as expressly required or provided by this Agreement, neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement could reasonably be expected to (either alone
or upon the occurrence of termination of employment) constitute an event under
any Company Employee Plan, Company Employee Agreement or other Company
Contract that may result (either alone or in connection with any other
circumstance or event) in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company Associate.

(e) The Company: (i) is, and at all times has been, in compliance in all
material respects with any Order or arbitration award of any court, arbitrator
or any Governmental Body respecting employment, employment practices, terms
and conditions of employment, wages, hours or other labor related matters;
and (ii) has withheld and reported all amounts required by applicable Legal
Requirements or by Contract to be withheld and reported with respect to wages,
salaries and other payments to Company Associates. The Company is not: (A)
liable for any arrears of wages or any Taxes or any interest or penalty for
failure to comply with the Legal Requirements applicable of the foregoing; or
(B) liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or
maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body with respect to
unemployment compensation benefits, industrial accident compensation
insurance, National Medical Insurance Plan, National Pension Plan or other
benefits or obligations for Company Associates (other than routine payments
to be made in the normal course of business and consistent with past
practice).

2.16 Insurance. Each material insurance policy and self-insurance program or
arrangement relating to the business, assets or operations of the Company is
in full force and effect and all premiums payable under each such
insurance policy have been timely paid. There is no pending claim involving
an amount in excess of KRW 100,000,000 in any individual case or KRW
500,000,000 in the aggregate, in each case under or based upon any insurance
policy of the Company, except for routine claims with respect to the
Companys welfare plans, including medical insurance policies. With respect to
each claim or Legal Proceeding that has been asserted or filed against the
Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has provided
written notice of such claim or Legal Proceeding to the appropriate insurance
carrier(s), if any, and no such carrier has issued a denial of coverage or a
reservation of rights with respect to any such claim or Legal Proceeding, or
informed the Company of its intent to do so on or prior to the date of this
Agreement.

is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement
may not be enforced in or by such court; and (d) irrevocably waives the right
to trial by jury.

upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; _provided,

obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by such party without the
