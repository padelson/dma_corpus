Insurance Policies, held by, or for the benefit of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the underwriter of such policies and the amount of
coverage thereunder. There is no claim by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pending under any such policies which (a) has been denied or
disputed by the insurer and (b) would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.20 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Banc of America Securities LLC, financial
advisor to the Company, has delivered to the Company Board a written opinion
(or an oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) to the effect that, as of
the date of such opinion, the consideration to be received in the Company
Merger by holders of Company Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

3.21 _Related Party Transactions_. Schedule 3.21 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of all arrangements, agreements, loans and

obligations) or (b) any Person who is an officer, director or Affiliate of

licenses, franchises, authorizations, consents, grants, certificates and
approvals from Governmental Entities required to conduct their businesses as
now being conducted or as presently contemplated to be conducted (the "
_Company Permits_ "), except for such Company Permits the absence of which
have not resulted in and would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except where the failure to
so comply would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. There is no pending threat of suspension, modification or
cancellation of any Company Permit that would reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Companys Knowledge and
except to the extent caused by the lack of one or more approvals,
notifications, reports or other filings set forth in paragraph 3.3(c) of this
Agreement, no Company Permit will cease to be effective as a result of the
consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.23 _Provisions of the MGCL Not Applicable_. Assuming the accuracy of the

control shares contained in Section 3-702 of the MCGL, will not apply to the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Company Merger. No Maryland law (including any "fair practice,"
"moratorium," "control share," "affiliate transaction" or "business
combination") or other takeover statute or similar law and no provision of the
Charter Documents or any Material Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party would or would purport to impose restrictions which
might adversely affect or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

3.24 _Brokers_. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except Banc of America
Securities LLC, whose fees and expense will be paid by the Company.
The Company has delivered to Parent a complete and accurate copy of the
agreement pursuant to which Banc of America Securities LLC is entitled to any
fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

is (nor immediately after consummation of the transactions shall be) an
investment company within the meaning of, or a company controlled by an
investment company within the meaning of, or otherwise subject to any
provisions of, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

any oral or written expression that any such activities, discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with it, and, as
applicable, include in such notice the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request and, if in
writing, shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) deliver to Parent
copies of any proposals, indications of interest, indication or request along
with all other related documentation and correspondence; and (B) keep Parent
informed on a prompt basis of the status and material terms of (including all
changes to the status or material terms of) any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request (and the Company shall provide Parent any additional
written materials that relate to such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request).

The Company Parties shall be responsible for any failure on the part of their
respective Representatives to comply with this Section 6.1(a). 

(b) Subject to compliance by the Company, CNL Partnership and the other
Subsidiaries of the Company with this Section 6.1 and only prior to the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board shall not be prohibited from
furnishing information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any Person that makes a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the
Company Board after the date hereof which was not invited, initiated,
solicited, encouraged or facilitated, directly or indirectly, by the Company,
CNL Partnership, any other Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative in
violation of Section 6.1(a), if, and only to the extent that (i) a majority
of the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation  



 

\- 43 -  with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside
legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company complies with all of its obligations
under this Agreement, and (iii) prior to taking such action, the Company
enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person the terms of which
are (without regard to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal) no less
favorable to the Company, and no less restrictive to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include any
provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may
not restrict the Company from complying with this Section 6.1, and (2) the
Company advises Parent of all such non-public information delivered to the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal concurrently with delivery to such
Person and concurrently with such delivery also delivers all such information
to Parent that was not previously provided to Parent. 

(c) Subject to compliance by the Company, CNL Partnership and the other
Subsidiaries of the Company with this Section 6.1 and only prior to the
Company Stockholder Approval, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company Board from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its
recommendation in favor of the Merger if (i) a Superior Proposal is made to
the Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) the Company shall have provided
written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent
that the Company has received a Superior Proposal and the Company Board is
prepared to approve or recommend such Superior Proposal, specifying all of
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying
the Person making such Superior Proposal, (iii) during the three business days
following Parents receipt of a Notice of Superior Proposal, (1) the Company
shall have offered to negotiate with (and if accepted, negotiated in good
faith with), and shall have caused its respective financial advisor and
outside legal counsel to offer to negotiate with (and if accepted, negotiated
in good faith with) Parent in making such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (2) the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel) after the end of such three business day period and
after considering the results of such negotiations and the revised proposals
made by Parent, if any, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice
of Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal, (iv) the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the withholding,
withdrawal, amendment or modification of such recommendation is required for
the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable law and (v) the Company shall not have violated
any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1 or Section 6.4. Nothing
contained in this Section 6.1(c) shall limit the Companys obligation to hold
and convene the Company Meeting (regardless of whether the recommendation of
the Company Board shall have been withdrawn, amended or modified).

(d) For all purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (on its most recently amended and modified
terms, if modified and amended) to the Company Board after the date hereof
which was not invited, initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated,
directly or indirectly, by the Company, CNL Partnership or any other
Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative in violation of Section
6.1(a), that is not subject to any financing contingency and which the Company
Board determines in good faith,  



 

\- 44 -  after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, (i) to be more favorable (taking into
account all terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, including the
financing terms, any conditions to consummation, any termination fee or
expense reimbursement payable under this Agreement, the likelihood of such
Acquisition Proposal being consummated, and the time required for
consummation) from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders (in
their capacities as stockholders) than the Merger (including any alterations
to this Agreement agreed to in writing by Parent in response thereto or any
revised proposals made by Parent in accordance with the terms hereof) and (ii)
the material conditions to the consummation of which are all reasonably
capable of being satisfied without undue delay. For the purposes of this
definition, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning set
forth in the above definition of Acquisition Proposal, except that all
references to "20%" shall be deemed references to "50%." 

(e) Any disclosure that the Company Board is required by law to make with
respect to the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal to comply with Rule 14d-9
or 14e-2 of the Exchange Act will not constitute a violation of this Section
6.1.

6.2 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and, once reasonably acceptable to Parent and
the Company, file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC under the
Exchange Act, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC promptly. Parent and the Company shall cooperate
with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the Company
shall as soon as practicable notify Parent of the receipt of any comments of

Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to
such documents being filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, (b) give Parent and its counsel a reasonable

to the extent practicable, the Company and its outside counsel shall permit
Parent and its outside counsel to participate in all communications with the
SEC and its staff (including all meetings and telephone conferences) relating
to the Proxy Statement, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other parties hereto, to
respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC and to cause
the Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be
mailed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at
the Company Meeting at the earliest practicable time. Each of Parent and the
Company will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing

in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. If at any time prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time any event shall occur, or fact or information
shall be discovered, that either the Company or the Buyer Parties reasonably
believe is required to be set forth in an amendment of or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement, the Company shall, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 6.2, prepare and file with the SEC such amendment or
supplement as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable and to the extent
required by applicable law, and cause such amendment or supplement to be

all other Persons entitled to receive notice of, the Company Meeting.

6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Each of the Company, CNL
Partnership, and the other Subsidiaries of the Company shall afford to
Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives,
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time, to all of its properties, offices, other
facilities, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, and records, during such
period, and the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration

information made available prior to the execution of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, in data rooms, electronic data rooms or
similar locations, and Parent and its Representatives shall have the right to
reasonable access to the Company Properties in order to conduct and prepare or

environmental assessments (including any onsite environmental investigation or
study) and other tests or examinations with respect to the Company Properties
and (c) all other information concerning its business, properties, assets and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Unless otherwise required by law,
such information will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.3 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

6.4 _Company Meeting_.

(a) Promptly after the date the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, the
Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with the MGCL and the
Company Articles of Incorporation and Company Bylaws and the rules of the NYSE
to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting as promptly as
practicable. Subject to Section 6.1(c), the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from the holders of Company Common Stock proxies
in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of
the Company Merger and will take all other action necessary or advisable
(including the adjournment of the Company Meeting) to secure the vote or
consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the NYSE and MGCL to
obtain such approvals and the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company (i) shall
adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to the extent necessary, including
by setting one or more additional record dates as required under the MGCL, to
ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the Companys stockholders sufficiently in advance of a vote on
this Agreement and the Company  



 

\- 46 -  Merger to insure that such vote occurs on the basis of full and complete
information as required under applicable law or (ii) shall (unless
Parent otherwise consents in writing or if prohibited by applicable law)
adjourn the Company Meeting, including by setting one or more additional
record dates as required under the MGCL, for a period not to exceed 30 days,
if as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement) or subsequently rescheduled or reconvened,
there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Meeting. The Company shall ensure that the Company Meeting is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited
by the Company in connection with the Company Meeting are solicited, in
compliance with the MGCL, the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company
Bylaws, the rules of the NYSE and all other applicable legal requirements. The
Companys obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.4(a) shall not be limited
or affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to
Company of any Acquisition Proposal, or by any withdrawal, amendment or
modification of the recommendation of the Company Board with respect to this
Agreement and the Company Merger.

(b) Subject to Section 6.1(c): (i) the Company Board shall recommend that the
holders of the Company Common Stock vote in favor of and approve this
Agreement, the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the Company Meeting; and (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include
a statement to the effect that the Company Board has unanimously recommended
that the holders of the Company Common Stock vote in favor of and approve this
Agreement, the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the Company Meeting.

6.5 _Legal Conditions to the Mergers; Further Action_. 

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, each party hereto shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly
as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party
any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders
required to be obtained or made by the Company or Parent or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby required under (A) the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state
securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and any request by a Governmental Entity
thereunder, and (C) any other applicable law and (iv) execute or deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. The parties
hereto shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all
such filings. The parties hereto shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations
of any applicable law (including all information required to be included in
the Proxy Statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



 

\- 47 - (b) Each of the parties hereto shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party consents related to or required in connection with the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby that are (i) necessary
to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
(iii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. In the event that any Company
Party shall fail to obtain any third party approval or consent described
above, the Company Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts,
and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize
any adverse effect upon the Company Parties and the Buyer Parties and their
respective businesses resulting, or which would reasonably be expected to
result, after the Company Merger Effective Time, from the failure to obtain
such consent or approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any
Person (other than a Governmental Authority) with respect to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) unless required by the applicable
agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, none of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person
and (ii) none of the Buyer Parties or their respective Affiliates shall be
required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur
any liability or other obligation.

(c) Each of the parties hereto agree to cooperate with each other in all
respects in connection with any filing or submission in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party. Each party shall keep the other apprised of the content and
status of any material communications with, and material communications from,
any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.
To the extent practicable and permitted by a Governmental Entity, each party
hereto shall permit representatives of the other party to participate
in meetings and calls with such Governmental Entity. None of the parties
hereto shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or
waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental
Entity without the consent of the other parties, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to vigorously contest and resist any Action, including
administrative or judicial Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or
prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal.

6.6 _Public Disclosure_. Parent and the Company agree that no public release
or announcement concerning the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
hereby shall be issued by either party or its Affiliates without the prior
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be  



 

\- 48 -  required by law, fiduciary duty or the applicable rules of the NYSE, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

6.7 _Company Stock Plans and Restricted Stock_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the
outstanding Company Stock Options under the Company Stock Plans, as set forth
on Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall become fully
vested and exercisable (whether or not then vested or subject to any
performance condition that has not been satisfied, and regardless of the
exercise price thereof). At the Company Merger Effective Time, each Company
Stock Option not theretofore exercised shall be canceled in exchange for the
right to receive a single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, whether or not
vested or exercisable, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration per share over the exercise price per share of such
Company Stock Option (the " _Option Merger Consideration_ ") less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section
2.4(h) hereof with respect to such payment. If the exercise price per share
of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the applicable
per share portion of the Company Merger Consideration, such Company Stock
Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof.

(b) Parent acknowledges that all restricted share awards ("
_Company Restricted Shares_ ") granted under the Company Stock Plans or
otherwise, as set forth on Section 6.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
that remain unvested automatically shall become fully vested and free of any
forfeiture restrictions immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, and each Company Restricted Share shall be considered an outstanding
share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including
the right to receive the applicable portion of the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration.

6.8 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the extent permitted
by law the present and former directors and officers of the Company (each, an
" _Indemnified Party_ ", and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all losses, expenses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts
that are paid in settlement of, with the written approval of Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or otherwise in
connection with any Action, including liabilities in connection with any
Action with respect to which the Surviving Corporation has withheld
settlement approval (a " _Claim_ "), arising out of or pertaining to matters
that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director or
officer of the Company and arising out of actions or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (including, without limitation,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), except for acts or omissions
involving willful or intentional misconduct or recklessness by such
Indemnified Party, and shall, to the extent permitted by law, pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such Action to each Indemnified Party
upon receipt from the Indemnified  



 

\- 49 -  Party to whom expenses are advanced of an undertaking to repay such advances
as they shall ultimately be determined in a final adjudication from which
there is not further right to appeal that the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event any Claim is brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising
before or after the Company Merger Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified
Parties may retain independent legal counsel satisfactory to them provided
that such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation,
(ii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements thereof are
received, provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim except to the
extent that two or more such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting
interests in the outcome of such Action, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation
will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of
any such matter. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 6.8 upon learning of any Claim, shall notify the Surviving
Corporation, although the failure to so notify the Surviving Corporation
shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any liability which the
Surviving Corporation may have under this Section 6.8 (except to the extent
that such failure materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation), and shall
deliver the Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated by this
subsection (b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected
without Parents or the Surviving Corporations written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(b) For a period of six years after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect a directors and
officers liability insurance policy covering those persons who are currently
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
with respect to Claims arising from facts or events that occurred before the
Company Merger Effective Time (complete and accurate copies of which has been
delivered to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement) with coverage in
amount and scope at least as favorable to such persons as the Companys
respective existing coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation will not be required, in order to maintain such directors and
officers liability insurance policy, to pay an annual premium in excess of
125% of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company to maintain
the existing policies; and provided further that, if equivalent coverage
cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in
excess of 125% of such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall only be
required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual
premium equal to 125% of such amount. In addition, and not in lieu of the
foregoing, Parent shall assume any and all indemnification agreements between
the Company and its officers and directors.

(c) This Section 6.8 is intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and personal representatives, and
shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns.

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent will give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company Parties will give prompt notice to Parent, of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, effect, development or change
which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause (a)
(i) any representation or warranty of such party contained in this  



 

\- 50 -  Agreement that is qualified as to materiality to be untrue or inaccurate in
any respect or (ii) any other representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement
until the Company Merger Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of the
Buyer Parties or the Company Parties, as the case may be, or of any officer,
director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.9 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys
obligation to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

6.10 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which
are the liability of the Company or Parent under applicable law in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.11 _Takeover Statute_. If any takeover statute or other anti-takeover
regulation or Law, charter provision or Contract is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the parties and their respective boards of directors (or
general partners, as applicable) shall (a) take all necessary action to ensure
that such transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
takeover statute, regulation, Law, charter provision or Contract.

6.12 _Termination of Qualified Plans and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Plans_.

The Company shall terminate all Employee Plans that are intended to be
qualified under Code Section 401(a) effective as of the date
immediately preceding the Closing Date. The Company shall terminate all
Employee Plans that are nonqualified deferred compensation plans as defined by
Code Section 409A effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date. The Company shall terminate all Employee Plans that are employee stock
purchase plans effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

6.13  _Consent Solicitation_.

(a) If requested by Parent, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to commence as promptly as practicable following the date of receipt
of the Consent Documents from Parent pursuant to paragraph (c) below and
instructions from Parent to commence the consent solicitation with respect to
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes on the
terms and conditions as determined in the sole discretion of Parent (the "
_Consent Solicitation_ "); _provided_ that (i) this Agreement shall have not
been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 and (ii) the Company shall
have received from Parent the completed Consent Documents which shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company. The Company shall
waive any of the conditions to the Consent Solicitation  



 

\- 51 -  (other than that the Mergers shall have been consummated and that there
shall be no order prohibiting consummation of the Consent Solicitation) as may
be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without the written consent
of Parent, waive any condition to the Consent Solicitation or make any changes
to the Consent Solicitation other than as agreed between Parent and the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, consummation of the Consent
Solicitation shall not be a condition precedent to the consummation of the
Mergers on the Closing Date.

(b) The Company agrees that, promptly following the consent expiration date,
assuming the requisite consents are received, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as is necessary shall execute a supplemental indenture to the
indenture governing the Senior Notes, which supplemental indenture shall
implement the amendments set forth in the Consent Solicitation and shall
become operative concurrently with the Company Merger Effective Time, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(c) Parent, at its own expense, shall prepare all necessary and appropriate
documentation in connection with the Consent Solicitation (collectively, the
" _Consent Documents_ "). Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Consent Documents. The Consent Documents (including all
amendments or supplements thereto) and all mailings to the holders of the
Senior Notes in connection with the Consent Solicitation shall be subject to
the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and shall
be reasonably acceptable in form and substance to each of them. If at any
time prior to the completion of the Consent Solicitation any information in
the Consent Documents should be discovered by the Company and the
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Consent Documents, so that the
Consent Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be prepared and disseminated by or on behalf
of the Company to the holders of the applicable Senior Notes. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.13, the Company shall comply
with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
applicable Law to the extent such Laws are applicable in connection with the
Consent Solicitation. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable Law
conflict with this Section 6.13, the Company shall comply with the applicable
Law and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations hereunder by
such compliance.

(d) In connection with the Consent Solicitation, Parent may select one or more
dealer managers, information agents or other agents to provide assistance in
connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements (including indemnities) with
such parties so selected and on terms and conditions acceptable to Parent.
Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of any dealer manager, information
agent, or other agent retained in connection with the Consent Solicitation,
and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all of their reasonable out-of-pocket costs in connection with the Consent
Solicitation promptly following incurrence and delivery of reasonable
documentation of such costs. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their Representatives (other than any direct
 



 

\- 52 -  indemnification of any dealer manager, which shall be indemnified under the
applicable dealer manager agreement, in connection with the Consent
Solicitation;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall indemnify the
Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with any dealer manager agreement)
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the Consent Solicitation and the Consent Documents;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have no obligation to indemnify and
hold harmless any such party or Person to the extent that such liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and

use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the PLR; provided, however,
to the extent the Company has complied with its obligations under this Section
6.19, the failure to obtain the PLR shall not be deemed to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and provided, further, that the ability to obtain the

breach of this Agreement (which includes without limitation the making of any
representation or warranty by a  



 

\- 58 -  party in this Agreement that the party knew was not true and accurate when
made) and the provisions of Sections 5.3 and 6.3 (regarding
confidentiality), 6.6, 8.3, 8.4 and Article IX of this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement indefinitely. If this Agreement is
terminated as provided herein, all filings, applications and other
submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall
be withdrawn from the Governmental Entity or other Person to which they were
made.

8.3 _General Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 8.4, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

8.4 _Certain Fees and Expenses_.

(a) If this Agreement shall be terminated (i) pursuant to Sections 8.1(e) or
8.1(f), then the Company thereupon shall pay to Parent a fee equal to the
Break-Up Fee (as defined herein) and the Break-Up Expenses (as defined
herein), or (ii) pursuant to Sections 8.1(b), 8.1(d) or 8.1(g) and prior to
the time of such termination an Acquisition Proposal has been received by the
Company or publicly announced, and either prior to the termination of this
Agreement or within nine months thereafter, the Company enters into any
written agreement to consummate or consummates a transaction or series of
transactions which, had such agreement been proposed or negotiated during the
term of this Agreement, would have constituted an Acquisition Proposal, then
the Company shall pay to Parent the Break-Up Fee and for termination pursuant
to Section 8.1(b), the Break-Up Expenses, upon the execution of such
agreement.

(b) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1(d) or
8.1(g), then the Company shall pay to Parent (provided that for termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(g), the Company was not entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) at the time of such termination) an
amount equal to the Break-Up Expenses. If this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then Parent shall pay to the Company (provided
that Parent was not entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(g) at the time of such termination) an amount equal to the Break-Up
Expenses.

(c) The payment of the Break-Up Fee and the Break-Up Expenses is not an
exclusive remedy, but is in addition to any other rights or remedies available
to the parties hereto (whether at law or in equity), and in no respect is
intended by the parties hereto to constitute liquidated damages, or be viewed
as an indicator of the damages payable, or in any other respect limit or
restrict damages available in the case of any breach of this Agreement. The
Break-Up Fee and Break-Up Expenses (as applicable) shall be paid by the
Company to Parent, or the Break-Up Expenses shall be paid by Parent to the
Company, in immediately available funds within two (2) business days after the
date the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment occurred
unless otherwise provided herein. The Company and Parent each acknowledge
that the agreements contained in this Section 8.4 are integral parts of this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Break-Up Fee
or Break-Up Expenses or Parent fails promptly to pay Break-up Expenses due
pursuant to this Section 8.4 and, in order to obtain payment, Parent or the
Company commence a suit against the other for  



 

\- 59 -  any amounts owed pursuant to this Section 8.4, the losing party shall pay to
the prevailing party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses, which it has incurred in enforcing its rights under this
Section 8.4) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount owed at the applicable judgment rate. Payment of the fees described
in Section 8.4 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of
breach of this Agreement.

(d) As used in this Agreement, " _Break-Up Fee_ " shall mean $34,500,000 and
the " _Break-Up Expenses_ " payable to Parent or the Company, as the case may
be (the " _Recipient_ "), shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
$7,500,000 or (ii) the Recipients actual out-of-pocket, documented expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including, without limitation, all reasonable
attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees and expenses).

8.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective
boards of directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and

herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party.

8.7 Extension of Outside Date. At any time upon 30 days prior written notice
by the Company to Parent or Parent to the Company, either party may, in its
sole discretion, extend the Outside Date from June 30, 2007 to September 30,

\- 61 - Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, telecopy, telex, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such
notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure

the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void; provided that
Parent may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned

Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of all remaining terms and provisions
hereof, the validity and enforceability of this Agreement as a whole, or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination  



 

\- 62 -  shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the parties with respect to the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it
in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed and

shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party
hereto and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party
need not sign the same counterpart.

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include

of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference
to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation". The parties intend that each representation
and each warranty contained in this Agreement shall have independent
significance. Accordingly, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, nothing contained in any representation or warranty, or the fact
that any representation or warranty may be more specific or less specific than
any other representation or warranty, shall in any way limit, restrict or
otherwise affect the scope, applicability or meaning of any other
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement.

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than the Partnership Merger, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Maryland without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Maryland. The
Partnership Merger shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of
any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.



 

\- 63 - 9.10 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or
delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any
single or partial waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent
breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

9.11 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or in equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

9.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal
court of competent jurisdiction of the State of Maryland in any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be
heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court and (d) agrees not to bring any Action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Action so brought and
waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other
party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another
party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served
at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section
9.2. Nothing in this Section 9.12, however, shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. PARENT AND THE COMPANY PARTIES
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE BUYER OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.



 

\- 64 - IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent and the Company Parties have caused this Agreement
to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the
date first written above.
