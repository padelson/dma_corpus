2013, is hereby entered into by and among Goodman Networks Incorporated, a
Texas corporation (" _Parent_ "), Manatee Merger Sub Corporation, a
Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"), and Multiband Corporation, a Minnesota corporation (the " _Company_ ").
Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in _Section
10.1_ hereof.

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub each
have approved, and declared it advisable to consummate, the acquisition of
the Company by Merger Sub by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "),
acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a committee of the Company Board
consisting only of independent and disinterested directors of the Company (the
" _Special Committee_ "), unanimously (i) has determined that the Merger is
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders,
(ii) has approved this Agreement, the plan of merger (as such term is used in
Section 302A.611 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ "))
contained in this Agreement (the " _Plan of Merger_ ") and the Merger upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (iii)
is recommending that the Company's shareholders approve the Merger and adopt
the Plan of Merger, as applicable;

  



  

WHEREAS, in the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, no par
value, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), except Excluded
Shares (as defined herein) and Dissenting Shares (as defined herein), will be
converted into the right to receive the Common Share Merger Consideration;

  



  

WHEREAS, in the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each issued and outstanding Preferred Share, except Preferred
Shares held by holders who comply with the provisions of the MBCA regarding
the right of shareholders to dissent from the Merger, will be converted into
the right to receive the Preferred Liquidation Consideration; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger, the "
_Transactions_ ") and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties
to this Agreement agree as follows:

Article I. 
  
 THE MERGER

  



  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the MBCA, at the Effective
Time, (a) Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and (b) the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease. Following the Merger,
the Company will continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") and will succeed to and assume all of the rights and
obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the MBCA.

  



  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than the
second Business Day, after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot
be satisfied until the Closing, but the Closing shall be subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) (the " _Closing Date_ "), at 10:00
a.m. Dallas time at the offices of Haynes and Boone, LLP, 2323 Victory
Avenue, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75219, unless another date or place is
agreed to in writing by the parties to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective when the
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the MBCA, are filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Minnesota; _provided_ , _however_ , that, upon the
mutual consent of Merger Sub and the Company, the Articles of Merger may
provide for a later date or time of effectiveness of the Merger (the date and
time of the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Minnesota, or such later time as is specified in the Articles of
Merger and as agreed to by Parent and the Company, being the " _Effective
Time_ "). The filing of the Articles of Merger shall be made on the Closing
Date.

  



  

Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the MBCA. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation. For all
purposes, all of the document deliveries and other actions to occur at the
Closing will be conclusively presumed to have occurred at the same time,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless otherwise specifically set
forth in the applicable document.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as
amended, shall be amended to read in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
and, as so amended, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and
applicable Law.

  



  

   

-2-

--- 

    



  

(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Company, as amended, shall be
amended to read in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and, as so
amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with their terms, the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers_ _of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective
Time, the directors of the Surviving Corporation shall appoint James L.
Mandel as the Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation and Steve
M. Bell as the Chief Financial Officer of the Surviving Corporation, in each
case until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Article II. 
  
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON Equity Interests

  



  

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action required on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of Equity Interests or the holders of securities of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, the following shall occur:

  



  

(a) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will thereafter be converted into and
represent one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (and the
shares of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub
capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving
Corporation's capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after
the Effective Time). Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of
Merger Sub common stock will evidence ownership of such shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) Each Equity Interest held by the Company (in the treasury or otherwise)
and each Equity Interest owned by Parent, any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and no payment or other
consideration shall be made with respect to such Equity Interest.

  



  

(c) Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Excluded Shares and any Dissenting Shares)
shall be canceled and extinguished and shall be converted into the right to
receive $3.25 per Common Share in cash, less applicable Taxes, if any,
required to be withheld with respect to such payment, payable to the holder
of such Common Share, without interest (the " _Common Share Merger
Consideration_ " and, together with the Preferred Liquidation
Consideration, the Company Restricted Share Consideration and the
Option Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such
Common Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and
automatically will be canceled and extinguished and shall cease to exist.

(d) Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and
extinguished and shall be converted into the right to receive a cash payment
in accordance with the terms of the applicable certificate of designation as
follows (the payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.1(d)_  shall be
referred to herein collectively as the " _Preferred Liquidation
Consideration_ "):

  



  

(i) The holder of each issued and outstanding share of Class A Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the Per Share
Class A Liquidation Payment in exchange for each such share.

  



  

(ii) The holder of each issued and outstanding share of Class C Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the Per Share
Class C Liquidation Payment in exchange for each such share.

  



  

(iii) The holder of each issued and outstanding share of Class F Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the Per Share
Class F Liquidation Payment in exchange for each such share.

  



  

Upon such conversion, all such Preferred Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding shares of Class B Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, Class D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock,
Class E Preferred Stock, Class G Convertible Preferred Stock, Series H
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series I Convertible Preferred Stock, or Series
J Convertible Preferred Stock.

  



  

(e) Each holder of a Share or Shares (other than any Excluded Shares and any
Dissenting Shares) will cease to have any rights with respect to such Share
or Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such
Share or Shares, upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such
Share or Shares (a " _Certificate_ "), subject to the provisions of
_Section 2.7_ , and, in the case of uncertificated Shares (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "), the book entry transfer of such Share or
Shares, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of evidence of transfer as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request, each in the manner provided in _Section
2.2_.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Payment; Surrender; Stock Transfer Books_.

  



  

(a) Before the Effective Time, Parent shall designate, at its election, the
Company's transfer agent or another bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the funds
necessary to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1_ and  _Section
2.3_ pursuant to procedures reasonably acceptable to the Company. At the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent in a separate account for the benefit of holders of
Shares (other than the Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares) (the "
_Payment Fund_ ") the aggregate consideration to which such holders shall be
entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.3_ ,
as applicable. If, for any reason, the cash in the Payment Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by Parent hereunder pursuant to _Section 2.1_  and _Section 2.3_ ,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, cash into the
Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of
cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any
event no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record
of Shares which were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.3_  (i) a
letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Shares will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificate or Certificates representing such Shares to the Paying Agent
or, with respect to Uncertificated Shares, book entry transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to Paying Agent, and will be in such form and have such
other provisions as the Company and Merger Sub may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificates or transferring the
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder
of a Certificate or Certificates or an Uncertificated Share or Uncertificated
Shares may thereafter, until the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
surrender any such Certificate or Certificates to the Paying Agent under
cover of the letter of transmittal or transfer any such Uncertificated
Shares by book entry transfer of such Uncertificated Share or
Uncertificated Shares upon receipt by the Paying Agent of evidence of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request (each a " _Valid
Transfer_ "). Upon the completion of a Valid Transfer on or before the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Paying Agent shall, and Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to, pay the holder of such Shares cash in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less any Taxes required to be
withheld and without interest, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.1_  and _Section 2.3_. Until so surrendered, each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and
Excluded Shares) or Uncertificated Share will represent solely the right to
receive the aggregate Merger Consideration relating to such Shares.

  



  

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of canceled Shares is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it will be
a condition to such payment that (i) either the Certificate so surrendered
will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer Taxes or
other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of
the registered holder of the Certificate or Uncertificated Share
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Merger Sub or
the Paying Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. The
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_  will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates
or such Uncertificated Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions, in each case with a record date (i) prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) prior to
the date of this Agreement, and in each case which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time.

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be
closed and there will not be any further registration of transfers of any
shares of the Company's capital stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares will cease
to have any rights with respect to any such Shares, except as
otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
will be canceled and exchanged for Merger Consideration as provided in this
_Article II_. Except for interest required to be paid with respect to
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the MBCA, no interest will accrue or be paid on
any cash payable to holders of Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_.

  



  

(e) Promptly following the date of the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any cash (including any interest received with respect to
such cash) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that, as of
the date of the first anniversary of the Effective Time, has not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, and thereafter
such holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors of
the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or transfer of their Uncertificated
Shares, without any interest on and less any Taxes required to be withheld
from such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent, nor the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent will be liable to
any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this
Agreement to any holder of Shares, and from amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ , such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld or deducted amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Treatment of the Stock Plans; Warrants_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding and unexercised option to
purchase Common Shares under the Director Stock Plan (each a "
_Director Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall become fully
vested, and shall automatically be canceled, and shall be converted into and
thereafter represent only the right to receive, in settlement thereof, a
cash payment, less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld and without
interest, equal to the product, if a positive number, of (i) the excess, if
any, of the Common Share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise
price of such Director Option and (ii) the number of Common Shares subject to
such Director Option (the " _Director Option Consideration_ ");  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Director Option for which the per share exercise price
equals or exceeds the Common Share Merger Consideration shall terminate and
be canceled without any payment in respect thereof.

(b) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding and unexercised option to
purchase Common Shares under the Employee Stock Plan (each an "
_Employee Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall become fully
vested, and shall automatically be canceled, and shall be converted into and
thereafter represent only the right to receive, in settlement thereof, a
cash payment, less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld and without
interest, equal to the greater of (i) the product, if a positive number, of
(A) the excess, if any, of the Common Share Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price of such Employee Option and (B) the number of Common
Shares subject to such Employee Option and (ii) the product of (A) $0.50 and
(B) the number of Common Shares subject to such Employee Option (the "
_Employee Option Consideration_ " and, together with the Director Option
Consideration, the " _Option Consideration_ ") (the Employee Options and the
Director Options are referred to collectively herein as the " _Options_ ").

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding restricted share of
Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (each a "
_Company Restricted Share_ ") subject to restrictions immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested), by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall become fully
vested and no longer subject to any restrictions, and then shall

interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA) of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Sections 302A.471 and
302A.473 of the MBCA;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if such a holder
fails to properly exercise dissenters' rights with respect to his, her or its
Shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA or,
after making a demand for dissenters' rights, subsequently delivers an
effective written withdrawal of such demand, or fails to establish his, her
or its entitlement to dissenters' rights as provided in Sections 302A.471 and
302A.473 of the MBCA, if so required, or (ii) if a court shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to receive payment for his, her or its Dissenting
Shares or such holder shall otherwise lose his, her or its dissenters'
rights, then, in any such case, each Share held of record by such holder or
holders shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration set forth for such Share in _Section 2.1_

split, reorganization, exchange or readjustment of shares or otherwise, or

contemplated by this Agreement prior to such change or event.

accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of

deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that could adversely affect in any material
respect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the

the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request, including any material amendments as to price and other material
terms thereof. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-

the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least five (5)
Business Days (the " _Notice Period_ ") before making an
Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into (or causing a Subsidiary to
enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such
action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state

Board intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the Company
intends to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement; (ii) the Company
attaches to such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement
(which version shall be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity of the

cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the

ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion,
proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that,
after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to
the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the
Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three
(3) Business Days remain in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the
Company notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood
that there may be multiple extensions)); (iv) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the
Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (v) the
Company complies with all other provisions of this Agreement,
including those contained in _Article VIII_.

or other business combination, of all or substantially all of the
Company\'s consolidated assets or at least two-thirds of the then outstanding

independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and which
Acquisition Proposal has not been rejected or withdrawn as of, or at any time
after, the Solicitation End Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such an
Acquisition Proposal is received by the Company less than two Business Days

in good faith, after consultation with independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would

counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation
of applicable Law.

any transaction in connection with the Debt Financing (with appropriate bring

be customary in connection with a financing substantially similar to the
Debt Financing; and (iv) taking such actions as are reasonably requested by
Parent or its financing sources to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely
basis of all conditions precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing. The
Company shall provide to Parent and the Lenders such information as may be
necessary so that the Financing Information and Marketing Material is

consent from any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to
Closing.

(b) Prior to the Closing, each party hereto shall promptly consult with the
other parties to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary
information with respect to, and provide the other parties hereto (or their
counsel) copies of, all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to filings under the HSR Act, the
parties hereto shall furnish only such information as is customarily shared
with other parties in connection with filings made under the HSR Act. Each
party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this
Agreement of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of
the Transactions. If any party to this Agreement or any Affiliate of such
parties receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such
party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other parties to this
Agreement, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. To the
extent that transfers of any Governmental Permits are required as a result of
the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to effect such transfers.

  



  

(c) The Company and Parent shall take all reasonable actions necessary to
file, as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, notifications under the
HSR Act and to respond, as promptly as practicable, to any inquiries received

Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and to
respond, as promptly as practicable, to all inquiries and requests received
from any state Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in
connection with antitrust matters.

  



  

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act, the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or state or
foreign Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In connection therewith, if any Action
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the
Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Laws, each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and use all commercially reasonable efforts to
vigorously contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts the consummation of the Merger or any other
Transaction, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal unless, by mutual agreement, Parent and
the Company decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 6.3(d)_ shall limit the right of any party hereto
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , so long as such
party hereto has, up to the time of termination, complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this _Section 6.3(d)_. Each of Parent
and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take such
action as may be required to cause the expiration of the waiting periods under
the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.

Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to file or cause to be
filed with the FCC an appropriate application for FCC consent to the transfer
of control to Parent of the FCC Authorizations (the " _FCC
Transfer Application_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to file
within such twenty (20) Business Day period shall not constitute a breach of
this Agreement so long as the filing is made as promptly as reasonably
practicable thereafter. The FCC Transfer Application and any supplemental
information furnished in connection therewith shall be in substantial
compliance with the FCC Rules, and shall contain such showings, information
and requests for waivers as shall be appropriate. Parent and the Company
shall furnish to each other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
the preparation, filing and prosecution of the FCC Transfer Application.
Parent and the Company shall each use all commercially reasonable efforts to
prosecute the FCC Transfer Application and shall furnish to the FCC any
documents, materials or other information reasonably requested by the FCC.

actions that would limit Parent's or its Subsidiaries' freedom of action with
respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses,
product lines or assets of the Company, Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries.

Company shall give prompt written notice to Merger Sub and Parent, and Merger
Sub and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the Company of (a) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence
could reasonably be expected to cause either (i) any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at any time
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time if such untruth or
inaccuracy could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.3(a)_ not to be satisfied or (ii) any
condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied at the Effective Time, (b) any
material failure of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, or
any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the Company,
Merger Sub or Parent as applicable, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, (c) any Action commenced, or to such party's Knowledge, threatened,
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, that are related to the Transactions, and (d)
any notice or other communication from (i) any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions or (ii) any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available under this Agreement to the party receiving such notice.

Subsidiaries and (y) with the prompt discharge by the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' employees of their duties. Parent shall, and shall cause
Parent's Affiliates and Representatives to hold any non-public information

their respective Representatives at all times.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding  _Section 6.5(a)_ , neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose any
information (i) where such access or disclosure could jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege or work product privilege of the Company or any of

permitted or made in order to ensure compliance with any applicable Law.

Agreement. Further, Parent shall cause any representative of Parent or Merger
Sub who is not a party to the Non-Disclosure Agreement, upon request by the
Company, to execute a joinder to such Non-Disclosure Agreement and agree to
be bound by the terms and conditions thereof. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.

warranties contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company, except as either party reasonably
believes, after receiving the advice of outside counsel and after informing
the other party, another form of press release may be required by Law or by
any listing agreement with a national securities exchange or trading market.
Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company,
Parent nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions without the prior consultation of the other
party, except pursuant to _Section 5.3_ or as such party reasonably believes,

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by an
Indemnified Party (including attorneys' and accountants' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that such individual is or was serving
at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries and arising out of or
pertaining to any action or omission occurring at or before the Effective
Time (including the Transactions) in accordance with the terms of the
Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such claim, action, suit,
investigation or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. If the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party advises that there are
issues that raise conflicts of interest with the Surviving Corporation, the
Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay the fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as statements
therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, after consultation with
Parent, shall cause to be purchased a directors' and officers'
liability "tail" insurance policy covering the six (6) years following the
Effective Time, to be effective as of the Effective Time, that serves to
reimburse the present and former officers and directors (determined as of the
Effective Time) of the Company and its Subsidiaries (as opposed to
reimbursing the Company or such Subsidiaries) with respect to claims against
such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before, at
or after the Effective Time (including as to, or arising out of or pertaining
to, the Transactions), which insurance shall contain substantially equivalent
scope and amount of coverage as provided in the directors' and
officers' liability insurance currently provided as of the date of this
Agreement by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _D andO Insurance_"); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not pay a premium for such
insurance policy in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate
premium paid by the Company for its directors' and officers' insurance
coverage in effect for the year that includes the date of this Agreement (the
" _D andO Premium_"). If the aggregate premium necessary to purchase such
insurance coverage exceeds three hundred percent (300%) of the DandO Premium,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
most advantageous "tail" insurance policy of directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance reasonably obtainable
for an aggregate premium not exceeding three hundred percent (300%) of the
DandO Premium.

  



  

(c) The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the
Company Charter Documents, and such provisions in the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall not be
amended, modified or otherwise repealed for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder as of the Effective Time of any individual who at the Effective
Time is a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or
previously was serving at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a
director, trustee, officer, member, manager, partner, fiduciary, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, limited
liability company, pension or other employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, unless such modification is required after the Effective Time by
Law and then only to the minimum extent required by such Law.

  



  

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.7_  shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall
be independently and directly enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.

  



  

(e) In the event that Parent or Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and

assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

(including with respect to salary and bonus but not equity awards) that are
substantially comparable to those provided by the Company as of the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that James L. Mandel and Steve M. Bell
shall not be covered by the 2013 Short-Term Incentive Plan.

(b) _Eligibility_. With respect to any Parent Plan in which any Employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries first becomes eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan documents or agreements,
Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to: (i) waive all pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each such Employee
and his or her eligible dependents under such Parent Plan, except to the
extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods applied
immediately prior thereto under the analogous Company Plan; (ii) provide
such Employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to becoming eligible to participate in
such Parent Plan under the analogous Company Plan (to the same extent that
such credit was given under such Company Plan) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or annual or lifetime maximum out-of-pocket requirements under
such Parent Plan; and (iii) recognize all service of such Employee with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and predecessors (including recognition of all
prior service with any entity (including any such Subsidiary prior to its
becoming a Subsidiary of the Company) that was recognized by the Company (or
any such Subsidiary) prior to the date hereof in the ordinary course of
administering its (or such Subsidiary's) employee benefits), for purposes of
eligibility to participate in and vesting in benefits under such Parent Plan,
to the extent that such service was recognized for such purpose under the
analogous Company Plan; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the
recognition of prior service result in a duplication of benefits.

  



  

(c) _No  Third Party Beneficiaries_. This _Section 6.9_  is not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contain herein, this

Plan, (ii) except as set forth in _Section 6.9(a)_ , require Parent to
continue any Company Plan or Parent Plan beyond the time when it otherwise
lawfully could be terminated or modified, or (iii) provide any Covered
Employee with any rights to continued employment, severance pay or similar
benefits following any termination of employment.

  



  

Section 6.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business
combination," "control share acquisition," "moratorium" or other antitakeover
statute or other similar statute or regulation becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any Transaction, then each of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
render such antitakeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be
disclosed by this Agreement, (b) shall not be construed as or constitute an
admission, evidence or agreement that a violation, right of termination,
default, non-compliance, liability or other obligation of any kind exists
with respect to any item, (c) with respect to the enforceability of Contracts
with third-parties, the existence or non-existence of third-party rights, the
absence of breaches or defaults by third-parties, or similar matters or
statements, is intended only to allocate rights and risks among the parties
to this Agreement and is not intended to be admissions against interests, give
rise to any inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible against any party
by any Person who is not a party, or give rise to any claim or benefit to any
entity or person who is not a party; and (d) does not waive any attorney-
client privilege associated with such item or information or any protection
afforded by the work-product doctrine with respect to any of the matters
disclosed or discussed herein. Unless the context otherwise requires (for
example, a Section of the Company Disclosure Letter corresponds to a
representation and warranty that requires disclosure of information that is
"material" or that could reasonably be expected to constitute a "Company
Material Adverse Effect"), such information and the dollar thresholds set
forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms
"material" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in
this Agreement. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to
imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included
or other items, are or are not material, and no Person shall use the fact
of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in
any dispute or controversy between the parties hereto as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Company
Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
