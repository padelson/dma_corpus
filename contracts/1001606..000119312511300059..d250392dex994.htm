the aggregate amount to be paid to such Member pursuant to  _Section
3.4(b)(ii)_.

(b) Each holder of Company Units who did not deliver to the Representative at

SECTION 3.7  _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days,
following the Closing Date or as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing
after the date hereof (the " _Delivery Date_ "), the Surviving Company shall,
at its expense, (i) cause to be prepared an unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, but which shall not reflect the
transactions occurring at the Closing (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "),
together with a statement (the " _Closing Date Schedule_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail the Surviving Companys calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt, and Company Expenses and
(ii) deliver to the Representative the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Date Schedule, together with a certificate of the Surviving Company executed
on its behalf by its Chief Financial Officer confirming that the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Schedule were properly prepared in good
faith and in accordance with this _Section 3.7(a)_. The accounts included in
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Schedule, including the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Company Expenses,
shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Standards. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event that any accounting methods, historical
policies, practices, principles and procedures, classifications, judgments
and estimation methodologies used in the Accounting Standards differ from or
are inconsistent with GAAP, consistent application of the Accounting Standards
will supersede GAAP. Buyer shall calculate the Closing Net Working Capital in
a manner consistent with the example set forth on _Exhibit D_ , including the
ledger items used therein. _Exhibit D_ shows, as an example only, the
calculation of Net Working Capital using the Latest Balance Sheet. Valuations
and estimates for the Closing Balance Sheet shall not reflect or take into
account developments between the Closing Date and the date of preparation or
completion of the Closing Balance Sheet except for those developments that
provide additional evidence with respect to conditions that existed on the
Closing Date. Solely in connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance
Sheet and Closing Date Schedule, Buyer agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause the Surviving Company not to, take any actions with respect to the
accounting books and

 



15  records of the Surviving Company on which the Closing Balance Sheet or
Closing Date Schedule are to be based that are not consistent with the
Accounting Standards.

 

(b) Review; Disputes.

(i) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall provide the
Representative and any accountants or advisors retained by the Representative
with full access, upon reasonable notice by the Representative and during
normal business hours, to the books and records and personnel of the Surviving
Company for the purposes of: (A) enabling the Representative and its
accountants and advisors to calculate, and to review the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Surviving Companys calculation of, the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Company Expenses; and (B)
identifying any dispute related to the calculation of any of the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Company Expenses in
the Closing Date Schedule. The reasonable fees and expenses of any such
accountants and advisors retained by the Representative shall be reimbursable
expenses pursuant to  _Section 8.7_ of this Agreement.

(ii) If the Representative disputes the calculation of any of the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt or Company Expenses
set forth in the Closing Date Schedule, then the Representative shall deliver
a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Surviving Company at any time
during the forty-five (45) day period commencing upon receipt by the
Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Schedule and the
related certificate of the Surviving Companys Chief Financial Officer, all as
prepared by the Surviving Company in accordance with the requirements of
_Section 3.7(a)_ (subject to extension for any period of inadequate access to
the underlying records) (the " _Review Period_ "). The Dispute Notice shall
set forth the basis for the dispute of any such calculation in reasonable
detail.

(iii) If the Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice to the
Surviving Company prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Surviving
Companys calculation of Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash,
Closing Debt and/or Company Expenses set forth in the Closing Date
Schedule shall be deemed final and binding on the Buyer, the Representative
and each Member for all purposes of this Agreement.

(iv) If the Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to the Surviving Company
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Representative and the
Surviving Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement
on the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and/or
Company Expenses that are in dispute. If the Representative and the Surviving
Company are unable to reach agreement on the Closing Net Working Capital
Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and/or Company Expenses that are in
dispute within twenty (20) days after the end of the Review Period, either
party shall have the right to refer such dispute to KPMG LLP (such firm, or
any successor thereto, being referred to herein as the " _Designated
Accounting Firm_ ") after such twentieth (20th) day, and neither party shall
allow the Designated Accounting Firm to perform audit or accounting work for
it to any material degree (other than as the Designated Accounting Firm under
this Agreement) from the date of submission of any dispute to the Designated
Accounting Firm through the date of final resolution of such claim. In
connection with the resolution of any such 

 



16  dispute by the Designated Accounting Firm: (1) each of the Representative,
on the one hand, and Buyer and the Surviving Company, on the other hand, shall
have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Designated Accounting Firm to
provide its views as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation of
the Closing Balance Sheet, any of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount,
Closing Cash, Closing Debt and/or Company Expenses; (2) each of the
Representative, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Surviving Company, on the
other hand, shall promptly provide, or cause to be provided, to the Designated
Accounting Firm all information and make available as are
reasonably necessary to permit the Designated Accounting Firm to resolve such
disputes; (3) the Designated Accounting Firm shall determine the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and/or Company Expenses in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after
such referral, and upon reaching such determination shall deliver a copy of
its calculations (the " _Expert Calculations_ ") to the Representative, Buyer
and the Surviving Company; and (4) the determination made by the Designated
Accounting Firm of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash,
Closing Debt and/or Company Expenses that are in dispute shall be conclusive,
binding upon the parties, nonappealable, and not be subject to further
review, and shall be considered a final arbitration award that is enforceable
pursuant to the terms of the Federal Arbitration Act. In calculating the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Company
Expenses, the Designated Accounting Firm (A) shall be limited to addressing
only those particular disputed items referred to in the Dispute Notice; and
(B) such calculation shall, with respect to any disputed item, be no greater
than the higher amount calculated by the Surviving Company or Representative,
as the case may be, and no lower than the lower amount calculated by the
Surviving Company or the Representative, as the case may be. The Expert
Calculations shall reflect in detail the differences, if any, between the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and/or Company
Expenses reflected therein and the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing
Cash, Closing Debt and/or Company Expenses set forth in the Closing Date
Schedule. The fees and expenses of the Designated Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between the Surviving Company, on the one hand, and the
Representative (on behalf of the Members), on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount actually contested by such party. If the Members shall be
required to pay any such fees or expenses, such fees or expenses shall
be first paid out of the Reserve Account and then out of the Escrow Account.
The allocation of the Designated Accounting Firms fees and expenses shall be
determined by the Designated Accounting Firm in accordance with the
methodology described above.

(c) If (1) the sum of (x) the amount, if any, by which the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount exceeds the Targeted Net Working Capital Amount and (y)
Closing Cash, _less_ Closing Debt, _less_ Company Expenses, _less_ the amount,
if any, by which the Targeted Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount, in each case as finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 3.7_, is greater than (2) the sum of (a) the amount, if
any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Targeted
Net Working Capital Amount and (b) Estimated Closing Cash, _less_ Estimated
Closing Debt, _less_ Estimated Company Expenses, and _less_ the amount, if
any, by which the Targeted Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated
Net Working Capital Amount, in each case as finally estimated in accordance
with _Section 3.2_, by an amount greater than Fifty Thousand Dollars
($50,000), then the Surviving Company shall, no later than one (1) Business
Day after such determination, cause to be paid to the Representative by
delivery of immediately available funds

 



17  an amount equal to such excess amount _plus_ interest on the value of such
amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the "Prime Rate" of
interest published in the "Money Rates" column of _The Wall Street Journal_
(or the average of such rates if more than one rate is indicated) on the
Closing Date; and the Representative shall allocate such amount between the
Variable Transaction Bonus Recipients and the Members in accordance with the
Variable Transaction Bonus Agreements. The Representative shall distribute the
portion of each amount available to the Members among the Members in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. With respect to the portion
payable to the Variable Transaction Bonus Recipients, the Representative shall
pay to the Non-Employee Variable Transaction Bonus Recipients their respective
shares and shall pay the balance to the Company for the benefit of the
Employee Variable Transaction Bonus Recipients (which amount shall be paid by
the Company to the Employee Variable Transaction Bonus Recipients, in
accordance with their respective shares of such amount, after deduction of
applicable income and employment tax withholdings, as well as any other
required withholdings).

(d) If (1) the sum of (x) the amount, if any, by which the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount exceeds the Targeted Net Working Capital Amount and (y)
Closing Cash, _less_ Closing Debt, _less_ Company Expenses, _less_ the amount,
if any, by which the Targeted Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount, in each case as finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 3.7_ is less than (2) the sum of the (a) the amount, if
any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Targeted
Net Working Capital Amount and (b) Estimated Closing Cash, _less_ Estimated
Closing Debt, _less_ Estimated Company Expenses, and _less_ the amount, if
any, by which the Targeted Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated
Net Working Capital Amount, in each case as finally estimated in accordance
with _Section 3.2_, by an amount greater than Fifty Thousand Dollars
($50,000), then the Surviving Company shall be entitled to receive payment
from the Reserve Amount in an amount equal to such deficiency _plus_ interest
on the value of such amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment at
the "Prime Rate" of interest published in the "Money Rates" column of _The
Wall Street Journal_ (or the average of such rates if more than one rate is
indicated) on the Closing Date. If the Reserve Amount is insufficient to
satisfy the deficiency calculated pursuant to this  _Section 3.7_, then the
Representative shall distribute the entire amount of the Reserve Amount to the
Surviving Company and the Surviving Company shall recover from the Escrow
Account the amount of the deficiency in excess of the Reserve Amount.

(e) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 3.7_ shall constitute an
adjustment of the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes and shall be treated
as such by the parties on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by law.

 

SECTION 3.8 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

SECTION 3.9 _Withholding_. Buyer, the Surviving Company and the
Representative shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Member any
amounts that are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer,
the Surviving Company or the Representative in accordance with the foregoing
and remitted to the 

 



18  appropriate Tax Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Member in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. 

ARTICLE IV.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a disclosure schedule with
numbered schedules corresponding to the relevant sections in this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such disclosure shall also be deemed to be applicable to other sections and
subsections of this Agreement to the extent that a matter is disclosed in such
a way as to make its relevance to the information called for by such other
section or subsection readily apparent. Nothing in the Company Disclosure
Schedule is intended to broaden the scope of any representation, warranty or
covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement. Subject to
the exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date (except for any representation or warranty
that expressly relates to a specific date) as follows:

SECTION 4.1 _Authority_. The Company has all requisite limited liability
company power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, and the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been
duly authorized by the Management Committee of the Company, and no other
limited liability company action on the part of the Company is necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder or the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties to
this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes a legally valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by principles of
public policy, and subject to (a) the effect of any applicable Law of general
application relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting creditors rights and relief of debtors generally and
(b) the effect of rules of Law and general principles of equity, including
rules of Law and general principles of equity governing specific performance,
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). The
approval of the Management Committee is the only approval required pursuant
to the LLC Agreement, and no affirmative vote or consent of the Members is
required to adopt this Agreement or approve the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

SECTION 4.2 _Organization_. The Company is a limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware, and has all requisite limited liability company power and
authority to own, operate and lease the properties and assets now owned,
operated or leased by it, and to carry on its business in all material
respects as currently conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business
as a

 



19  foreign limited liability company, and is in good standing, under the Laws
of each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties owned, operated
or leased, or the nature of its activities, makes such qualification
necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
or in good standing, when taken together with all other failures by the
Company to be so qualified or in good standing, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the
Certificate of Formation (the " _Certificate of Formation_ ") and the Amended
and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Company (the " _LLC
Agreement_ "), each as amended and in effect as of the date of this Agreement,
have been made available to Buyer. For purposes of this Agreement, "made
available" shall mean posted to the Merrill datasite that has been used for
due diligence in connection with the transaction to which this Agreement
relates and labeled so as to make its location readily apparent, accessible by
the Buyer, two (2) Business Days prior to the date hereof.

 

SECTION 4.3 _Capitalization_. _Schedule 4.3_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth all of the outstanding Company Units held by each Member
of the Company. There are no other equity ownership interests of the Company
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding, and no outstanding options,
warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for
Company Units or other equity ownership interests of the Company other than
those set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All
Company Units have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
nonassessable and free of any preemptive rights.

SECTION 4.4 _Subsidiaries_. _Schedule 4.4_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true, correct and complete list of the Companys Subsidiaries as
of the date of this Agreement. Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company has
been duly formed or organized, is validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, and has
all requisite power and authority to own, operate or lease the properties and
assets now owned, operated or leased by it, and to carry on the Business in
all material respects. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation (or other entity, as applicable), and is in
good standing, under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the character of
its properties owned, operated or leased, or the nature of its activities,
makes such qualification necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing, when taken together with all
other failures by such Subsidiary to be so qualified or in good standing,
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The
outstanding shares of capital stock or membership interests of each of the
Companys Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject to, nor were they issued in
violation of, any preemptive right. The Company or one or more of its wholly
owned Subsidiaries own of record and beneficially all the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or membership interests of such
Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens. Except as
set forth in _Schedule 4.4_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no
authorized or outstanding options, warrants, rights, subscriptions,
agreements or obligations to issue any shares of capital stock, membership
interests or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for shares, units or other equity or voting interest in any Subsidiary of
the Company.

SECTION 4.5 _Conflicts_. Assuming all consents, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, filings and notifications and other actions described in
_Section 4.6_ and set forth in

 



20   _Schedule 4.6_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule have been obtained or
made, and any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has expired or been
terminated, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, and the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, does not
and will not (a) conflict with or result in a violation of the Certificate of
Formation or the LLC Agreement; (b) conflict with or result in a material
violation of any material Governmental Order or Law applicable to the Company
or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or properties or (c)
result in a material breach of, or constitute a material default (or event
which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a
material default) under, or give rise to any rights of
termination, amendment, modification, acceleration or cancellation of or loss
of any benefit or increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements of any Person (including a right to consent or notice), under any
contract, agreement, indenture, mortgage, debenture, note or other
instruments entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result
in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) on any
of the assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to any Listed Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of the assets or properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are bound or affected.

 

SECTION 4.6 _Consents, Approvals, Etc_. No consent, waiver, approval,
authorization, order or permit of, or declaration, filing or registration
with, or notification to, any Governmental Authority or third party is
required to be made or obtained by the Company in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by
the Company of its obligations hereunder, or the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (a) the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware; (b) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under, or the receipt of approvals under, the HSR Act; (c) applicable
requirements, if any, under Federal or state securities or "blue sky" Laws;
(d) other consents, approvals, authorizations or actions where the failure to
obtain such consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing
or notification would not, when taken together with all other such failures by
the Company, have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect; (e) as may be necessary as a result of any facts or
circumstances relating solely to Buyer or any of its Affiliates; and (f) as
set forth in _Schedule 4.6_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

SECTION 4.7 _Financial Statements_. The Company has prepared, or caused to be
prepared, and made available to Buyer (i) the audited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of January 1, 2011, and the
related audited consolidated statements of operations, members equity and
cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the twelve (12) month

material respects to all applicable provisions of the Insurance Policies.

power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Buyer and Merger Sub,
the performance by each of Buyer and Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder,
and the consummation by each of Buyer and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized by each of Buyer
and Merger Sub, and no other action on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer
and Merger Sub, the performance by Buyer and Merger Sub of their obligations
hereunder or the consummation by Buyer and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and

 



32  delivered by each of Buyer and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties to this Agreement, this Agreement
constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of each of Buyer and
Merger Sub, enforceable against Buyer and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by principles of public
policy, and subject to (a) the effect of any applicable Law of general
application relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting creditors rights and relief of debtors generally and
(b) the effect of rules of Law and general principles of equity, including

business as a foreign entity, and is in good standing, under the Laws of each
jurisdiction in which the character of its properties owned, operated or
leased, or the nature of its activities, makes such qualification necessary,
except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, when taken together with all other failures by either Buyer or
Merger Sub to be so qualified or in good standing, would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of each of Buyer
and Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub does not have any
Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.3 _Conflicts_. Assuming all consents, approvals, authorizations,

by each of Buyer and Merger Sub, the performance by each of Buyer and Merger

will not (a) conflict with or result in a violation of any organizational
documents of Buyer and Merger Sub; (b) conflict with or result in a violation
of any Governmental Order or Law applicable to Buyer or Merger Sub or their
assets or properties or (c) result in a material breach of, or constitute a
material default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time,
or both, would become a material default) under, or give rise to any rights of
termination, amendment, modification, acceleration or cancellation of or loss
of any benefit or increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights
or entitlements of any Person (including a right to consent or notice), under
any contract, agreement, indenture, mortgage, debenture, note or other
instruments entered into by Buyer or Merger Sub, or result in the creation of
any Encumbrance on any of the assets or properties of either Buyer or Merger
Sub pursuant to any Contract to which Buyer or Merger Sub is a party, or by
which any of the assets or properties of Buyer or Merger Sub are bound or
affected, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) of this _Section 5.3_,
as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of each of Buyer and Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



33 SECTION 5.4 _Consents, Approvals, Etc_. No consent, waiver, approval,
authorization, order or permit of, or declaration, filing or registration
with, or notification to, any Governmental Authority or third party is
required to be made or obtained by Buyer or Merger Sub in connection with the

performance by Buyer and Merger Sub of their respective obligations hereunder,
or the consummation by Buyer and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except for (a) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; (b) the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under, or the receipt of
approvals under, the HSR Act; (c) applicable requirements, if any, under
Federal or state securities or "blue sky" Laws; and (d) where the failure to
obtain such consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing

by Buyer or Merger Sub, have a material adverse effect on the ability of each
of Buyer and Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.5 _Litigation and Governmental Orders_. As of the date of this
Agreement, (a) there are no material Actions pending against Buyer, Merger
Sub or any other Affiliates of Buyer (" _Buyer Subsidiaries_ "), or any of the
assets or properties of Buyer, Merger Sub, or any Buyer Subsidiaries or any of
the directors, officers, managers or members of Buyer, Merger Sub or any
Buyer Subsidiaries in their capacity as directors, officers, managers or

material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer or Merger Sub to perform
their obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) Buyer, Merger Sub and the Buyer

funds or available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities in the

required to be filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period
(a " _Straddle Period Tax Return_ "), and (ii) any non-Income Tax Return in

which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(e) If any of the Income Tax Returns described in _Section 6.8(c)_ and (to
the extent attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period) the Tax Returns

on all Income Tax Returns for the Stub Period, and the parties agree not to
apply the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulations Section

other items relating to the Merger or other transactions contemplated herein
shall be included as deductions on any Income Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period without the consent of Buyer.

(g) The parties shall ensure that the transactions contemplated hereby are
structured in a manner that causes the Tax year of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to end as of the Closing Date for all Income Tax purposes to the
extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(h) Tax Proceedings.

(i) After the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates shall promptly notify the
Representative in writing of any Tax Proceeding that relates solely to any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding_
") or any Tax Proceeding that relates to a Straddle Period. After the Closing
Date, the Representative shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of any Tax
Proceeding, notice of which is received by the Representative or any Member
with respect to any Tax period. Notices required to be given by or to Buyer or
the Representative shall contain factual information (to the extent known or
reasonably available to Buyer or the Representative, as the case may be)
describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any Tax Authority in
respect of any such asserted Tax liability. To the extent inconsistent
therewith, this  _Section 6.8(h)_, and not _Section 8.5_, shall govern with
respect to Tax Proceedings.

(ii) In the case of a Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding, the Representative shall
have the right to direct and control the conduct of such Pre-Closing Tax
Proceeding, provided Buyer shall have the right to participate (at Buyers own
expense) in any such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding. Buyers right to participate
shall include the right to receive copies of all correspondence from any Tax
Authority relating to such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding, attend meetings and
review and comment on submissions relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding,
and the Representative shall consider in good faith any comments provided by
Buyer. The Representative may elect to waive its right under this _Section
6.8(h)(ii)_ to direct and control any Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding. Upon such a
waiver, the Representative shall have the right to participate (at the
Representatives own expense) in any such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding. The
Representatives right to participate shall include the right to receive
copies of all correspondence from any Tax Authority relating to such Pre-
Closing Tax Proceeding, attend meetings and review and comment on submissions
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding, and Buyer shall consider in good
faith any comments provided by the Representative. None of Buyer, the Company
and any of their Subsidiaries shall settle, resolve, concede or otherwise
compromise any issue, matter or item arising in any Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding
without the Representatives prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(iii) In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to any Straddle Periods,
Buyer shall have the right to control the conduct of such Tax Proceeding,
provided the Representative shall have the right to participate (at the
Representatives own expense) in any 

 



40  such Tax Proceeding. The Representatives right to participate shall include
the right to receive copies of all correspondence from any Tax Authority
relating to such Tax Proceeding, attend meetings and review and comment on
submissions relating to any Tax Proceeding, and Buyer shall consider in good
faith any comments provided by the Representative. Neither Buyer, the Company
nor any of their Subsidiaries shall settle, resolve, concede or otherwise
compromise any issue, matter or item arising in any Tax Proceeding for any
Straddle Period without the Representatives prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, _provided_ that no such
consent shall be necessary if such settlement, resolution, concession or
compromise would not result in any claim for indemnification under Article
VIII or the surrender of any claim to a refund to which the Representative is
entitled under  _Section 6.8(h)_.

(i) The Representative (on behalf of the Members) shall be entitled to the
amount of any refund or credit of Taxes (including any estimated Taxes) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including the portion of any Straddle Period constituting the Pre-Closing Tax
Period), including any such refund or credit of Taxes resulting from the
carryback of any net operating loss shown on any Income Tax Return of the
Company or any Subsidiary for the Stub Period, but not for a refund or credit
of Taxes resulting from the carryback of any net operating loss shown on any
Income Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary for any Post-Closing Tax
Period. Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Representative any amount
to which the Representative is entitled pursuant to the prior sentence within
five (5) Business Days of the receipt of such refund or the recognition of
such credit resulting in an actual reduction of cash Taxes payable by Buyer,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(j) For all purposes under this Agreement, in any case involving a Straddle
Period, the portion of any Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period will be: (i) in the case of Property Taxes, deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days of such Straddle Period
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the Company and its
Subsidiaries terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date.

(k) All indemnification payments made pursuant to _Article VIII_ shall
be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes,
except as otherwise required by applicable Tax Law.

(l) Buyer or the Surviving Company shall not amend any Tax Return of the
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the consent of the
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 

(m) Notwithstanding any limitation in this Agreement, but subject to _Section
6.8(l)_, Buyer or the Surviving Company shall have the right to file or amend
Tax Returns of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period solely with respect
to Identified Tax Items (other than the Transaction Tax Benefit Items),
including to determine the position of the Company to be taken for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period on a Tax Return to be filed after the Closing Date, if,
based on the advice of its independent tax advisors, such action is reasonably
necessary in order to

 



41  properly report the Identified Tax Items (other than the Transaction Tax
Benefit Items). Buyer shall consult with the Representative, and shall
consider reasonable comments by the Representative, before taking any such
action, but the decision of the Buyer shall be final. Nothing in this
provision shall affect the right of Buyer to be indemnified under _Section
8.1(a)(iv)_ of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.9 _Employee Benefit Matters_. Buyer agrees that, for a period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date (the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ "), Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company to, (a) provide employee benefits to Company
Employees that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits
that are provided under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Closing, (b) provide each Company Employee with a base salary or rate of pay
that is no less than the base salary or rate of pay that was in effect
for such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (c) honor the
Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ attached hereto, and (d)
maintain the Companys annual cash bonus plan as in effect on the Closing
Date. With respect to any benefit plans of Buyer in which Company Employees
may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date, Buyer shall: (i) waive
any limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Company Employees to the extent waived or not applicable under an analogous
Company Benefit Plan; (ii) provide each Company Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid on or prior to the Closing Date during the
year in which the Closing Date occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent it would be recognized under an
analogous Company Benefit Plans and (iii) recognize all service of the
Company Employees with the Company and its Affiliates or predecessors thereof
(to the extent such service was recognized by the Company and its Affiliates
under an analogous Company Benefit Plan) for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting credit and entitlement for benefits (other than benefit
accruals), except to the extent such treatment would result in duplication of
benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall
be construed in any way to (x) increase or extend the obligations of Buyer or
the Company under the terms of such Company Benefit Plans or to restrict
existing rights of the Company to terminate or modify such Company Benefit
Plans or (y) create any right in any employee to continued employment by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or preclude the ability of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Company Employee
for any reason. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall amend any Company
Benefit Plan or confer any third-party beneficiary rights or other rights or
remedies upon any Company Employee.

SECTION 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give notice
to Buyer, and Buyer shall give notice to the Company, promptly upon becoming
aware of any occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence
or failure to occur has caused or could reasonably be expected to cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing.

SECTION 6.11 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

 



42 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Company to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
Management Committee member, director and officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_ "), against any actual
damages, claim, losses, costs, liabilities or expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses, costs of investigation, response action, removal
action or remedial action incurred or suffered by any of the Company
Indemnitees in connection with any liabilities or any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or its
Subsidiaries would have been permitted under applicable Law and under the LLC
Agreement or comparable documents of the Companys Subsidiaries, in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to indemnify such Company
Indemnitees and (ii) advance expenses as incurred by any Company Indemnitee in
connection with any matters for which such Company Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification from Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.11(a)_ to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law or, if greater, under the LLC
Agreement or comparable documents of the Companys Subsidiaries; _provided_
,  _however_ , that the Company Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and all rights of appeal have
lapsed, that such Company Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under
applicable Law, the LLC Agreement or comparable documents of the Companys
Subsidiaries, or pursuant to this _Section 6.11(a)_.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Companys limited
liability company agreement (or similar governing document) and the
comparable documents of the Companys Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of the Company Indemnitees than are currently set forth in
the Companys LLC Agreement and the comparable documents of the relevant
Subsidiaries of the Company.

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Buyer shall
maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain, in effect a
directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the current and
former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as such existing coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not
be obligated to pay premiums or other expenses in excess of 150% of those
associated with such insurance maintained in effect by the Company and the
Subsidiaries, in each case, as on an annual basis; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that this _Section 6.11(c)_ shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if a prepaid policy or policies (i.e., "tail coverage") have been
obtained by the Surviving Company which policy or policies provide such
directors, Management Committee members and officers with the coverage
described in this _Section 6.11(c)_ for an aggregate period of not less than
six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Closing Date, including with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the premiums for such
prepaid policies shall have been paid in full at or prior to the Effective
Time and such prepaid policies shall be non-cancelable. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained by Buyer prior to the Effective Time, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



43 (d) In the event that Buyer or the Surviving Company or its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of the its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, fulfill
and comply with the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.11_.

 

(e) The terms and provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the Company Indemnitees by
applicable Law, charter, limited liability company operating agreement, bylaw
or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, the Company Indemnitees and their respective heirs and representatives,
each of whom is an intended third party beneficiary of this _Section 6.11_.

SECTION 6.12  _Provision Regarding Legal Representation_. Recognizing that
Latham and Watkins LLP (" _Latham_ ") has acted as advisor to the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, Buyer hereby waives, on its own behalf,
and agrees to cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to waive,
effective as of the Closing, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
Latham representing or advising the Representative and each Member and their
respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Member Group_
"), and any Management Committee member, director, member, partner, officer,
employee or Affiliate of the Member Group after the Closing in connection with
the matters covered by  _Section 3.7_ or any indemnification claims pursuant
to _Article VIII_.

SECTION 6.13 _Access to Records and Personnel_.

(a) _Exchange of Information_. After the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Company to, and the Surviving Company shall, provide, or cause to
be provided, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request therefor
and at the requesting Members expense, reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to the Surviving Companys employees and to any books,
records, documents, files and correspondence in the possession or under the
control of the Buyer or the Surviving Company that the requesting Member
reasonably needs (i) to comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other
requirements imposed on any Member (including under applicable securities
Laws) by a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such Member; (ii)
for use in any other judicial, regulatory, administrative or other proceeding
or in order to satisfy Tax, audit, accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation
or other similar requirements or (iii) to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement.

(b) _Financial and Other Information_. After the Closing, the Surviving
Company shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each requesting Member and
the Representative such financial and other data and information reasonably
available and in its possession (in such form as is reasonably available to
it) for any period prior to the Closing Date as is reasonably requested by
such Member and necessary in order for any Member or the Representative to
prepare its financial statements and reports or filings with any Governmental
Authority; _provided_ that the provisions of this _Section 6.13(b)_ shall in
no way obligate Buyer or the Surviving Company to prepare any
financial statements.

 



44 (c) _Ownership of Information_. Any information owned by Buyer or the
Surviving Company that is provided to a Member pursuant to this _Section
6.13_ shall be deemed to remain the property of Buyer or the Surviving
Company, as the case may be. Unless specifically set forth herein, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring
rights of license or otherwise in any such information.

(d) _Record Retention_. Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer and the
Surviving Company agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to retain
the books, records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence,
writings, evidences of title and other papers relating to the Business in
their respective possession or control for a commercially reasonable period of
time, consistent with their regular document retention policies, following the
Closing Date or for such longer period as may be required by Law.

SECTION 6.14 _280G Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall submit
for approval in a manner that complies with the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the
" _Section 280G Approval_ ") all payments or benefits that in the absence of
such approval could reasonably be expected to constitute "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
thereunder) to any individuals that are "disqualified individuals" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the regulations thereunder). To
the extent that any such "disqualified individual" has the right to receive
payments that could constitute "parachute payments", the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall obtain an irrevocable written
waiver of such rights prior to soliciting the approval described in the
immediately preceding sentence such that the Section 280G Approval shall, if
successful, establish each "disqualified individuals" right to the payment.
The Company shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Buyer a draft of all
Section 280G Approval related documents, including any disclosure documents
and "disqualified individual" waivers. The Company shall incorporate any
reasonable comments that are timely made by Buyer to the Section 280G Approval
related documents. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to
Buyer evidence that the Section 280G Approval described in this _Section
6.14_ was solicited and no "parachute payments" related to such vote will be
payable or retained.

ARTICLE VIII.

INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 8.1 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_ , from and
after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount shall be available to indemnify
Buyer and the Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, partners, members, stockholders, employees, agents or
representatives (the " _Buyer Indemnified Persons_ ") for, and hold
them harmless from, any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense including
reasonable legal fees and expenses (collectively, the " _Losses_ ") directly
arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
_Article IV_ that survives the Closing;

 

(ii) any breach of any covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement;

 

(iii) any fees of any broker or finder engaged by the Company or any Affiliate
of the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby;

(iv) any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period; and 

(v) any Transfer Taxes allocable to the Members under _Section 6.8(a)_.

 

(b) The Members shall not be required to indemnify any Person, and shall not
have any liability:

 

(i) under _Section 8.1(a)_ unless the aggregate of all Losses for which all
Members would, but for this clause (i), be liable exceeds on a cumulative
basis an amount equal to $1,850,000, and then only to the extent of any such
excess Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that no claim for Losses pursuant to
_Section 8.1(a)_ of $50,000 or less shall be asserted by Buyer or counted or
otherwise aggregated for purposes of either (x) determining whether the
threshold set forth in this clause (i) has been reached or (y) comprising the
portion of Losses that exceeds such threshold;  _provided_ that the
limitations in this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not apply to any claims for
indemnification under _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_, _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ or
_Section 8.1(a)(v)_; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that for purposes of this
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_, in determining the amount of any Losses resulting from
or in connection with the breach of any of the representations and warranties
made by the Company in  _Article IV_ of this Agreement, such representations
and warranties shall be read as though none of them contained any reference to
Material Adverse Effect or other materiality qualifiers;

 



47 (ii) for any and all Losses under this Agreement in excess of the Escrow
Amount (except for Losses that are the result of fraud by any person); or

(iii) under _Section 8.1(a)_ to the extent the Losses arise from, relate to
or are otherwise in respect of any action taken or omitted to be taken by
Buyer or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors,
employees, agents or representatives, except for any actions taken pursuant
to  _Section 6.8(d)_, _Section 6.8(l)_ and _Section 6.8(m)_ hereof.

(c) The parties acknowledge that notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, (A) any amount that is taken into account in making
the calculations described in _Section 3.7_ shall not form the basis for a
claim for breach of any representation or warranty under this Agreement or
any indemnity or other claim hereunder, and (B) the rights set forth in
_Section 3.7_ are the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the subject
matter thereof.

 

(d) The parties acknowledge that, after the Closing, their (and their
respective Affiliates) sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this _Article VIII_ (other than claims and causes of action based
on fraud).

 

(e) [Reserved]

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except as set
forth in the last sentence of this  _Section 8.1(f)_, after the Effective
Time, the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall only be entitled to satisfaction for
any Losses for which indemnification is available hereunder out of the Escrow
Account. Except as provided in the last sentence of this _Section 8.1(f)_,
after the Escrow Account is exhausted, the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall no
longer have any right to indemnification. On the Survival Date, the Survival
Date Release Amount shall be distributed to the Members and Variable
Transaction Bonus Recipients, as directed by the Representative, in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the
"Survival Date Release Amount" shall mean the excess, if any, of the amount
remaining in the Escrow Account over the Retained Amount _less_ the Tax
Distribution Amount. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Retained Amount"
shall mean the sum of (i) $4,000,000 (the " _Identified Tax Retained Amount_
") _plus_ (ii) if, as of the Survival Date, any Buyer Indemnified Person has
asserted in writing any claim pursuant to this _Article VIII_ (and its good
faith estimate of its Losses in respect of such claim) that the Buyer
reasonably expects to give rise to a right of indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ that is pending and unresolved, an amount equal to such good
faith estimate. After the Survival Date, the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall
be entitled to satisfaction for any Losses relating to any Identified Tax
Items (other than Claims described in clause (ii) of this _Section 8(f)_
relating to Identified Tax Items) only out of the Identified Tax Retained
Amount. On the date that is four (4) years after the Closing Date (the "
_Final Release Date_ "), the Final Release Amount shall be distributed to the
Members and Variable Transaction Bonus Recipients, as directed by the
Representative, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, the "Final Release Amount" shall mean (x) the
amount of any remaining funds in the Escrow Account _less_ (y) the Tax
Distribution Amount  _less_ (z) if, as of such date, any of Buyer Indemnified
Person has asserted in writing any claim pursuant to this _Article VIII_ (and
its good faith estimate of its Losses in respect of such claim), whether or
not relating to Identified Tax Items, that the Buyer

 



48  reasonably expects to give rise to a right of indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ that is pending and unresolved, an amount equal to such good
faith estimate (it being understood that any such claim that is not related
to the Identified Tax Items shall have been made prior to the Survival Date,
and that no new claims for indemnification for Losses unrelated to Identified
Tax Items may be made after the Survival Date). Within five (5) Business Days
after the final resolution of a particular indemnity claim for which amounts
are retained in the Escrow Account past the Survival Date or the Final Release
Date, as the case may be, the amount, if any, by which the estimated Losses
in respect of such claim being held in the Escrow Account exceed the finally
determined Losses in respect of such claim, _less_ the Tax Distribution
Amount, shall be distributed to the Members and Variable Transaction
Bonus Recipients, as directed by the Representative, in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. The finally determined Losses shall be
distributed to the applicable Buyer Indemnified Persons in accordance with the
Escrow Account. Upon each distribution to the Members and Variable
Transaction Bonus Recipients, as directed by the Representative, under this
_Section 8.1(f)_, an amount equal to the corresponding Tax Distribution
Amount shall be distributed to the Buyer. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to prevent or restrict the bringing or maintenance of any action
between any parties hereto, or the granting of any appropriate legal remedy,
to the extent that the Losses shall have been the result of fraud by
any person (and in the event of fraud, recourse shall only extend to the
Person or Persons committing such fraud).

SECTION 8.2  _Indemnification by Buyer and Merger Sub_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Effective Time,
Buyer and the Surviving Company, and each of their respective successors and
assigns, shall indemnify Members and their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, members, partners, stockholders, employees, agents and
representatives, and hold them harmless from, any Losses directly arising
from, relating to or otherwise in respect of (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in _Article V_
that survives the Closing (and has not otherwise expired), (b) any breach of
any covenant of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company contained in this
Agreement, (c) any fees of any broker or finder engaged by Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or (d) any Transfer Taxes allocable to Buyer
under Section 6.8(a).

SECTION 8.3 _Calculation and Mitigation of Losses_. The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII shall be net of any
amounts available to such Indemnified Person under insurance policies or other
collateral sources with respect to such Loss, shall be reduced to take account
of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Person arising
from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss and shall be increased to take
into account any net Tax detriment actually incurred by the Indemnified Person
as a result of the indemnification payment. Each Indemnified Person shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under insurance policies or
other collateral sources with respect to such Loss. In the event any amounts
recovered under insurance policies or other collateral sources are not
received before any claim for indemnification is paid pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ , and thereafter if the Surviving Company receives any
recovery, the amount of such recovery shall be applied first, to reimburse
the Surviving Company for its out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) expended in pursuing such recovery, second, to
refund any payments made by the Indemnifying Party which would not have been
so paid had such recovery been obtained prior to such payment, and third, any
excess to the

 



49  Surviving Company. It is understood and agreed that no Indemnified Person
shall be indemnified or reimbursed for any Tax consequences arising from
adjustments to the basis of any stock or assets resulting from an adjustment
to the Merger Consideration or any additional Taxes resulting from such basis
adjustment.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, "Losses" shall not
include any consequential, incidental or indirect damages, special or punitive
damages, including loss of revenue, profits or income, diminution in value of
securities or loss of business reputation or opportunity, in each case except
to the extent such amounts were paid by the Indemnified Person to a third
party. In valuing a "Loss," no adjustment shall be made as a result of any
multiplier of the Companys earnings before interest, tax, depreciation or
amortization (or any similar valuation metric), increase factor or any other
premium over fair market, book or historical value which may have been paid by
Buyer or Merger Sub for the Company, the Company Units and/or its assets
whether or not such multiple, increase factor or other premium had been used
by Buyer or Merger Sub at the time of, or in connection with, calculating or
preparing its bid, its proposed purchase price or its final purchase price
for the Company Units and/or its Companys assets. Any indemnification payment
made hereunder shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration.

 

(b) Each party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any of its Losses
(including, to the extent consistent with sound business judgment, incurring
costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives
rise to the Losses and taking steps to prevent any contingent liability from
becoming an actual liability) upon becoming aware of any event which
would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

SECTION 8.4 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless any person entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "
_Indemnified Person_ "), in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty
or covenant, shall terminate when the applicable representation, warranty or
covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 8.6_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which the Indemnified Person shall have, before
the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a non-speculative
claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the
basis of such claim) pursuant to _Section 8.5_ to the party with the
indemnification obligation (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ").

SECTION 8.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) In order for an Indemnified Person to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving
a claim made by any Person (other than the Indemnifying Party) against the
Indemnified Person (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Person must
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing and in reasonable detail, to the
extent available, of such claim (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that the failure to give a timely Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an
Indemnified Person hereunder only if and to the extent that such failure has
a materially prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to
the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Claim
Notice shall (i) state that the Indemnified Person has incurred,
or reasonably and in good faith expects to incur, Losses for which such
Indemnified Person is entitled to

 



50  indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) specify in reasonable
detail, to the extent available, the nature of such Third Party Claim and an
estimate of the amount of the applicable Losses (if reasonably practicable)
to which such Indemnified Person reasonably and in good faith believes it may
be entitled to hereunder; and (iii) state whether the Losses for which the
Indemnified Person is seeking indemnification relate to the Identified Tax
Items. Thereafter, the Indemnified Person shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, promptly following the Indemnified Persons receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers and excluding
all internally prepared documents or documents prepared by counsel or other
representatives of Indemnitee) received by the Indemnified Person relating to
the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in the defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party also shall be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected
by the Indemnifying Party, _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel is not
reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Person. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Person for any expenses (legal or
otherwise) subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with
the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense,
the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying
Party shall control such defense, _provided_ , _however_ , that if in the
reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Person the use of counsel chosen by
the Indemnifying Party to represent such Indemnified Person would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest, then the Indemnifying Party shall bear
the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel. The
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of one counsel
(and one local counsel in each jurisdiction where local counsel is required)
employed by the Indemnified Person for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any
period in which the Indemnified Person shall have failed to give notice of the
Third Party Claim as provided above). If the Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the Indemnified Parties shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Person shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise
or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned
or withheld). If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Person shall agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of a Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may recommend and
that by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of
the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim (and does not impose
any additional obligation on the Indemnified Person other than such payment)
and which shall release the Indemnifying Party completely in connection with
such Third Party Claim.

 



51 (c) If any Indemnified Person should have a claim against any Indemnifying
Party under  _Section 8.1_ or _8.2_ (unless the claim for indemnification
shall not have been made on or prior to the Survival Date) that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall deliver a Claim
Notice with respect to such claim with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified Person to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability that it may have to such Indemnified Person under _Section 8.1_ or
_8.2_ , except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it
has been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. If the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of competent jurisdiction.

SECTION 8.6 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing solely for purposes of _Article VIII_ and shall terminate upon the
close of business on the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date (the "
_Survival Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the indemnity provided in _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ with respect to
each Identified Tax Item shall survive until the earlier of (i) the
expiration of the statute of limitations relating to the latest Tax year that
includes the effect of such Identified Tax Item and (ii) four years after the
Closing Date. All covenants hereunder shall survive until performed in
accordance with their terms or become no longer applicable, it being agreed
that for purposes of _Article VIII_ the Indemnified Person shall be entitled
to make a claim against the Indemnifying Party at any time prior to
the Survival Date solely in respect of the Indemnifying Partys failure to
perform a covenant on or prior to the Closing Date (which shall include, for
the avoidance of doubt, the items set forth in _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ and 
_Section 8.1(a)(v)_).

SECTION 8.7 _Reserve Account_.

 

(a) The Representative is hereby authorized to establish an account for the
Reserve Amount to be used for the purposes set forth herein (the " _Reserve
Account_ "). The Representative is hereby authorized to use the funds in the
Reserve Account, or, to the extent the Reserve Amount has been exhausted, to
use any remaining funds in the Escrow Account, to satisfy, to the extent
there are sufficient funds therefor, (i) all costs, fees, expenses,
liabilities or other obligations of the Members or the Representative
hereunder (including expenses of attorneys, accountants and other advisors),
(ii) payments to be made pursuant to _Section 3.7(d)_, (iii) payments to be
made pursuant to _Section 6.8(e)_ and (iv) any other obligations or expenses
incurred by the Representative in connection with the performance of its
duties under this Agreement and the other agreements entered into in
connection herewith.

(b) At such time as the Representative reasonably determines that the Reserve
Account is no longer necessary to satisfy any existing or anticipated costs,
fees, liabilities, expenses or other obligations of the Members or the
Representative, including with respect to the defense or settlement of any
unresolved actual or potential claims, the Representative shall distribute to
the Members, in accordance with each Members Pro Rata Share any funds
remaining in the Reserve Account; _provided_ , _however_ , that the funds in
the Reserve Account shall not be distributed to the Members until (i) any
payment required to be made by the

 



52  Representative pursuant to _Section 3.7(d)_ and (ii) the payments required
to be made pursuant to _Section 6.8(e)_ have been made or it has been
determined by Buyer and the Representative that no such payments are
required.

ARTICLE IX.

 

TERMINATION

SECTION 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and the Company;

(b) by either the Company or Buyer by written notice to the other party if
any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such matters shall have
issued a Governmental Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such Governmental Order shall have become final and
nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the terms of this _Section
9.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party unless such party shall have used
its commercially reasonable efforts to oppose any such Governmental Order or
to have such Governmental Order vacated or made inapplicable to the Merger or
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which such Governmental
Order relates; and

(c) by either the Company or Buyer by written notice to the other party if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to September 30, 2011 (the "
_Outside Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or
prior to such date is the result of any action or inaction under this
Agreement by the party seeking to terminate the Agreement pursuant to the
terms of this _Section 9.1(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
that prior to September 30, 2011 any antitrust authority commences a second
request in order to investigate the Merger, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended to December 15, 2011.

SECTION 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned pursuant to _Section 9.1_,
this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and effect;
_provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of _Section
6.4_ (Confidentiality), this _Article IX_ (Termination), _Article X_ (General
Provisions) and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination
of this Agreement, whether in accordance with _Section 9.1_ or otherwise.
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, nothing in this _Article IX_
shall be deemed to (x) release any party from any liability for any knowing
fraud or any willful and malicious material breach of any covenant or
agreement under this Agreement committed by such party, (y) impair the right
of any party to compel specific performance by any other party of such
Persons obligations under this Agreement or (z) limit the right of any party
to commence any Action for improper or wrongful termination of this Agreement.

55 SECTION 10.5 _Interpretation_. The Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to
alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement. References to Articles, Sections or Exhibits in this Agreement,
unless otherwise indicated, are references to Articles, Sections and Exhibits
of this Agreement. References to Schedules in this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated, are references to the corresponding Schedules in the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The parties to this Agreement have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises with respect to any term or
provision of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties to this Agreement, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party to this
Agreement by virtue of the authorship of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to any Federal, state, county, local or foreign
statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. For all
purposes of and under this Agreement, (a) the word "including" shall be
deemed to be immediately followed by the words "without limitation;" (b) words
(including defined terms) in the singular shall be deemed to include the
plural and vice versa; (c) words of one gender shall be deemed to include the
other gender as the context requires and (d) the terms "hereof," "herein,"
"hereto," "herewith" and any other words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including all of the Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement) and not to any
particular term or provision of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified.
For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the requirement that consent
shall be given in writing shall be satisfied if such consent is given by
e-mail.

SECTION 10.6  _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the terms
or provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other certificate,
instrument or other document referred to in this Agreement, shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or any other such certificate, instrument or other
document referred to in this Agreement, and the parties to this Agreement
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute one or more
valid, legal and enforceable terms or provisions into this Agreement which,
insofar as practicable, implement the purposes and intent of this Agreement.
Any term or provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in
part, degree or within certain jurisdictions shall remain in full force and
effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable to the extent
consistent with the intent of the parties as reflected by this Agreement. To
the extent permitted by applicable Law, each party waives any term or
provision of Law which renders any term or provision of this Agreement to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.

SECTION 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the other Schedules and the Exhibits to this Agreement),
the Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter

and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement. 

 



56 SECTION 10.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties to
this Agreement (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties to this Agreement and the Representative
(which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of such
other parties and the Representative), and any purported assignment or other
transfer without such consent shall be void and unenforceable. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 10.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section
6.11_ and _Article VIII_ , this Agreement and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 10.10 _Waivers and Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written instrument executed by Buyer, the Company and the
Representative. Any failure of the parties to this Agreement to comply with
any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement may be
waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a
written instrument signed by the party or parties granting such waiver. No
delay on the part of any party to this Agreement in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
waiver on the part of any party to this Agreement of any right, power or
privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise
provided, the rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the parties
to this Agreement may otherwise have at law or in equity. Whenever this
Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of a party, such consent
shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a
waiver of compliance as set forth in this _Section 10.10_.

SECTION 10.11 _Equitable Remedies_. Each of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that the other parties to this Agreement would be
irreparably harmed in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees that the other parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by
such first party under this Agreement, and each party to this Agreement hereby
agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the other parties to this
Agreement have an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition, legal
or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction or specific performance as a
remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond
in connection with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies described in
this _Section 10.11_ shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
remedies at law or in equity that the parties to this Agreement may elect to
pursue. 

 



57 SECTION 10.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within such State. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or Federal court of the
United States of America, sitting within the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, the agreements delivered in connection with
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees
not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts; (ii)
agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may
be heard and determined in such Delaware State court or, to the extent
permitted by Law, in such Federal court; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any
such Delaware State or such Federal court; and (iv) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or such
Federal court. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 10.3_. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.

SECTION 10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.12_.

 



58 SECTION 10.14 _Representative_.

 

(a) The Member Confirmations shall provide for the appointment, authorization
and empowerment of Genstar Capital Partners III, L.P. as representative (the
" _Representative_ "), for the benefit of the Members, as the exclusive agent

Actions, and, in connection therewith, to (A) assert any claim or institute
any action, proceeding or investigation; (B) investigate, defend, contest or

the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document in connection with

the Members in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Representative shall have the right and power to
use the Reserve Account to pay, or reimburse the Representative and its

SECTION 10.15 _Guarantee of Performance by Parent_.

(a) Parent hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees,
without notice and presentment or other legal formalities, all of the

warrants to the Company and the Representative that, for purposes of this
Agreement, for itself in its own corporate capacity, Parent is also making the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article V_ as if it were Buyer.

 

(b) In the event of a default by Buyer under this Agreement, Parent waives any
right to require the Company or Representative to:

(ii) pursue any other remedy whatsoever in the power of the Company or the
Representative prior to the Company or the Representative pursuing any rights
they may have under this Agreement against Parent.

 



60 (c) Parent agrees that the Company or the Representative, as the case may be,
may also make any agreement with Buyer or Merger Sub for the extension,
renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release of any obligation of Buyer
or Merger Sub hereunder, in whole or in part, without in any way impairing or
affecting Parents obligations under this _Section 10.15_ or affecting the
validity or enforceability of this _Section 10.15_. Parent agrees that the

or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or delay on the part of
the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy
against Buyer or Merger Sub; (ii) any rescission, waiver, compromise,
consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement; (iii) any change in the legal existence,

waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Law which would
otherwise require any election of remedies by the Company or
the Representative. Parent acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

This Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger is made and entered into
as of September 6, 2011 by and among SP Companies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Buyer_ "), GenWoods HoldCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the " _Company_ "), and Genstar Capital Partners III, L.P. as the
Representative (the " _Representative_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Buyer, Grenade LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Blount,
Inc., a Delaware corporation, the Company and the Representative entered into
that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 15, 2011 (the "
_Original Merger Agreement_ "); and

WHEREAS, the Buyer, the Company and the Representative deem it advisable and
in their respective best interests to amend the Original Merger Agreement in
the manner contemplated hereby.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for other good
and valuable consideration, receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

1\. Schedule 1.1(a) of the Original Merger Agreement is hereby deleted and
replaced with Schedule 1.1(a) hereto.

 

2\. The definition of "Closing Net Working Capital Amount" is hereby deleted
and replaced with the following:

 

" _Closing Net Working Capital Amount_ " means (i) the aggregate dollar amount
of all consolidated current assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (but
excluding Cash, deferred and current income tax assets), less (ii) the
aggregate dollar amount of all consolidated current liabilities of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including outstanding checks and an amount equal to the
actual Annual Bonuses due at closing in accordance with the 2011 Incentive
Bonus Program (regardless of whether paid at Closing and regardless of whether
paid as specified by _Section 3.10_) as current liabilities but excluding
current and deferred income tax liabilities, Closing Debt, Company Expenses,
the Fixed Transaction Bonuses and the Variable Transaction Bonuses), in each
case as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date determined in accordance with _Section 3.7_.

3\. Section 3.2 is hereby deleted and replaced with the following: SECTION 3.2 _Pre-Closing Statements_. The Company shall deliver to the Buyer,
not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a
certificate of the Company (the " _Company Pre-Closing Certificate_ ")
executed on its behalf by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company that sets
forth in reasonable detail the Companys good faith estimates of the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ "),
Closing Cash (" _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), Closing Debt (" _Estimated
Closing Debt_ "), and Company Expenses (" _Estimated Company Expenses_ "),
along with the supporting detail therefor, such estimates to be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Standards; _provided_  that for purposes of
determining the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, the Company shall
include as a current liability an accrual for Annual Bonuses calculated in
accordance with the 2011 Incentive Bonus Program provided that the ratio
of actual performance to targeted performance shall be based on the Companys
estimated year-to-date results of operations through August 27, 2011.

4\. Clause (iii) of Section 3.4(b) is hereby deleted and replaced with the
following:

(iii) to the Company, the Fixed Transaction Bonuses payable to Company
employees in immediately available funds (and Buyer shall cause such Fixed
Transaction Bonuses to be paid to such employees within two (2) Business Days
after the Closing Date after deduction of applicable income and employment Tax
withholdings, as well as any other required withholdings under _Section
3.9_);

 

5\. The following is hereby added to the Agreement as a new Section 3.10:

 

SECTION 3.10 _Annual Bonuses_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Closing Date but in no event later than fifteen (15) days after the
Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall determine its year-to-date results
of operations through August 27, 2011 and shall calculate the Annual Bonuses
based on the ratio of actual year-to-date August 27, 2011 performance to
targeted year-to-date August 27, 2011 performance. The Surviving Company shall
pay the Annual Bonuses to the participants in the 2011 Incentive Bonus Program
as part of the next regular payroll following the determination of the
results of operations through August 27, 2011. Such payments shall be subject
to the deduction of applicable income and employment Tax withholdings, as well
as any other required withholdings under _Section 3.9_. 

6\. Except as modified hereby, all of the terms and conditions of the Original
Merger Agreement remain in full force and effect and are hereby reaffirmed,
ratified and approved. This Amendment, together with the Original Merger
Agreement, embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. No
statement, representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any kind not
expressly set forth in this Amendment shall affect, or be used to interpret,
change or restrict, the express terms and conditions of this Amendment.
Hereafter references to the Merger Agreement in any document or other
agreement shall be deemed

 



2  to constitute references to the Original Merger Agreement as amended by this
Amendment. This Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. Execution and delivery of this Amendment may be
made and evidenced by facsimile transmission.
