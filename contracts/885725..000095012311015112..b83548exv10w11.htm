the employee&#146;s principal place of work immediately prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date.
The Purchaser shall commence and conclude all activities necessary to effectuate satisfaction of
the Purchaser Employment Contingencies with respect to the Corresponding Transfer Date Employees
whose employment is not required to be transferred automatically pursuant to Transfer Law at its
own cost and within the sixty (60)&nbsp;days prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date or, solely
with respect to the Closing Transfer Employees, within the period of time commencing on the date
hereof and concluding on the Closing, provided that BSC and the Sellers shall have provided access

applicable Transfer Laws or the provisions of Section&nbsp;6.01(b) or the Transition Services Agreement,

against any cost, obligation or liability to the extent attributable to a failure of BSC or its

the Purchaser&#146;s Employment Contingencies to the Purchaser&#146;s satisfaction, including any claims
brought by individuals for failure to become employed or continue in employment with the

Corresponding Transfer Date Employee who accepts such offer or whose employment transfers
automatically under applicable Transfer Laws and who, in either case, actually commences employment
with the Purchaser as of the applicable Employee Transfer Date. With respect to any employee who
is on short-term disability leave, workers&#146; compensation leave, or other authorized leave of
absence as of the date of the applicable Employee Transfer Date and who accepts such offer of
employment with the Purchaser or whose employment transfers automatically, such employment with the
Purchaser shall commence and such employee shall become a Transferred Employee as of the date of
such employee returns to active employment, subject to applicable Law.
