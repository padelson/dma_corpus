 _Section 2.03_ _Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price_. (a) The

consist of $1,400,000,000 (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ "), (ii) the
Milestone Payments contemplated by Section 2.04 and (iii) the Assumed
Liabilities. To the extent that any amount of VAT is required to be paid with
respect to any payment made by the Purchaser to BSC under this Section 2.03
or under Section 2.04, the amount of such payment shall be increased to
include the amount of VAT so required to be paid. 

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall
provide to BSC, for income Tax purposes, the PurchaserÂ’s proposed allocation
of the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets (the " _Allocation
Statement_ "). BSC shall review the Allocation Statement and, to the extent
BSC in good faith disagrees with the content of the Allocation Statement, BSC
shall, within twenty-one (21) days after receipt of the Allocation Statement,
provide written notice to the Purchaser of such disagreement, which notice
shall contain specific items of disagreement and reasons therefor. If BSC
does not object by written notice within such 21-day period, the PurchaserÂ’s
Allocation Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder and for all Tax purposes. If BSC notifies the Purchaser that it
objects to the Allocation Statement, the parties will attempt in good faith
to resolve any such disagreement until the 90th day following the Closing
Date (the " _Allocation Date_ "). If the parties cannot resolve their
differences at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, the Allocation
Statement will become an estimated allocation used for purposes of the 

      ##### 

  

    

Closing. If the parties cannot resolve their differences by the Allocation
Date, the issues in dispute shall be referred to a third party firm that has
expertise in valuation matters and that is mutually agreeable to the
Purchaser and BSC (the " _Third Party Firm_ ") and the decision of the Third
Party Firm will be binding on the parties. The decision will be reflected in a
revised Allocation Statement which will be considered the final allocation.
The costs of the Third Party Firm shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and
BSC. 

  

(c) The Purchaser and BSC each agree to file, and to cause their respective
Affiliates to file, their income Tax Returns and all other Tax Returns and
necessary forms in such a manner as to reflect the allocation of the
consideration as determined in accordance with Section 2.03(b), and shall
take no position inconsistent therewith in any audit, litigation or other
proceeding. 

   

 _Section 2.04_ _Milestone Payments_. No later than five (5) Business Days
after the occurrence of an event described in this Section 2.04, the
Purchaser shall deposit in the Purchase Price Bank Account the applicable
payment associated with such event as specified below (any such payment, a "
_Milestone Payment_ "), less any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Law (provided that the Purchaser and BSC shall cooperate in good faith to
determine the amount of any such Taxes required to be withheld);  _provided_
that if the event described in Section 2.04(a) occurs prior to the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall deposit in the Purchase Price Bank Account on the
Closing Date the Milestone Payment applicable to such event: 

 

(a) $50,000,000 if (i) the FDA provides written notification of clearance
of the 510(k) submission for the TargetTM Detachable Coils provided to the
Purchaser by BSC prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that the
parties agree that any deviations from such form in the written notification
of such clearance from the FDA shall be disregarded for purposes of this
Section 2.04(a) to the extent such deviations would not change the indications
for use contained in such 510(k) submission and otherwise would not
materially and adversely delay or affect the PurchaserÂ’s ability to market
and sell TargetTM Detachable Coils (it being agreed that any requirement that
post-market clinical trials be conducted will not by itself constitute a
material and adverse effect for this purpose), and (ii) BSC has at least 3,500
units of TargetTM Detachable Coils in inventory that comply with, and are
available to be delivered pursuant to, the terms of the Supply Agreement; 

  

(b) $15,000,000 following the completion of the Cork Separation Activities
(as such term is defined in the Separation Agreement) in accordance with the
terms of the Separation Agreement, which may occur prior to the Cork
Manufacturing Transfer Date; 

  

(c) $15,000,000 following the occurrence of the Cork Manufacturing Transfer
Date in accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement; 

  

(d) $10,000,000 following the occurrence of the Fremont Manufacturing
Transfer Date in accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement; and 

  

(e) $10,000,000 following the occurrence of the West Valley Manufacturing
Transfer Date in accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement. 

       ##### 

  

     

 _Section 2.05_ _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets and the assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at
a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at the offices of Shearman and Sterling
LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York at 10:00 A.M. New York time on
the fifth Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
to the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02
(other than those conditions which, by their terms, are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or
at such other place or at such other time or on such other date as BSC and
the Purchaser may mutually agree upon in writing. The day on which the
Closing takes place being the " _Closing Date_ ". 

  

 _Section 2.06_ _Closing Deliveries by BSC_. At the Closing, BSC shall, and
shall cause the Sellers to, deliver to the Purchaser:

being understood that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

directors, employees, agents, representatives, accountants and counsel to, (i)
afford the Purchaser and its officers, employees and authorized agents and
representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties and books and
records of BSC and the Sellers (to the extent relating to the Business) and
(ii) furnish to the officers, employees, and authorized agents
and representatives of the Purchaser such additional financial and operating
data and other information regarding the Business (or copies thereof) as the

any Transferred Site, provided that such assessment shall not include any
sampling or testing of any soil, groundwater, air or other environmental
media, or building material, without the express written consent of BSC, such
consent to be withheld at the sole discretion of BSC);  _provided_ that any
such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at
the PurchaserÂ’s expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision
of BSCÂ’s personnel and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with
the normal operations of the Business. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, BSC shall not be required to disclose any
information to the Purchaser if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to,
(i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege (provided that
BSC shall, and shall cause the Sellers to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to put in place an arrangement to permit such disclosure without loss
of attorney-client privilege) or (ii) contravene any applicable Laws,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof
(provided that BSC shall, and shall cause the Sellers to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to put in place an arrangement to permit such disclosure
without violating such Law, duty or agreement). 

 

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by BSC or the Sellers relating to the Business or for any other
reasonable purpose, for a period of seven years after the Closing or the
expiration of the relevant period for the statutes of limitations,
the Purchaser shall (i) retain the books and records relating to the Business
relating to periods prior to the Closing, and (ii) upon reasonable notice,
afford the officers, employees, agents and representatives of BSC or the
Sellers reasonable access (including the right to make, at BSCÂ’s expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and records;
_provided_  that the Purchaser shall notify BSC at least 20 Business Days in
advance of destroying any such books and records in order to provide BSC the
opportunity to copy such books and records in accordance with this Section
5.02(b). 

  

(c) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against
or incurred by the Purchaser relating to the Business or for any other
reasonable purpose, for a period of seven years after the Closing or the
expiration of the relevant period for the statutes of limitations, BSC shall
(i) retain the books and records relating to the Business relating to periods
prior to the Closing which shall not otherwise have been delivered to the
Purchaser and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the officers, employees,
agents and representatives of the Purchaser reasonable access (including the
right to make, at the PurchaserÂ’s expense, photocopies), during
normal business hours, to such books and records; _provided_ that BSC shall
notify the Purchaser at least 20 Business Days in advance of destroying any
such books and records in order to provide the Purchaser the opportunity to
copy such books and records in accordance with this Section 5.02(c). 

        ##### 

  

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this
Section 5.02 shall not apply to Tax Returns and related information (that are
exclusively addressed in Section 5.14). 

   

 _Section 5.03_ _Confidentiality_. (a) The terms of the letter agreement
dated as of April 5, 2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between BSC
and the Purchaser are hereby incorporated herein by reference and
shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the Purchaser under this
Section 5.03 shall terminate; _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate only in respect of that portion of the Evaluation Material
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) relating to the Business. If
this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and
effect. 

 

(b) Nothing provided to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.02(a) shall in
any way amend or diminish the PurchaserÂ’s obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any
Evaluation Material provided to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.02(a) or
otherwise by BSC, the Sellers or any officer, director, employee, agent,
representative, accountant or counsel thereof shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 _Section 5.04_ _Regulatory and Other Authorizations_. (a) Each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain
all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Authorities and officials that may be or become necessary for its execution
and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will cooperate fully with the other
party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders
and approvals, including cooperation to enable the Purchaser to obtain, to
the extent not included in the Purchased Assets, all material Permits and
Registrations necessary for the operation of the Business as
currently conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted and the
ownership of the Purchased Assets. Each party hereto agrees to make promptly
(but in no event later than ten Business Days of the date hereof) its
respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act. Each party hereto agrees to make as promptly as practicable its
respective filings and notifications, if any, under any other applicable
antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law (together with the HSR Act,
the " _Antitrust Laws_ "), to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the applicable
Antitrust Law and not to enter into any transaction prior to the Closing that
would reasonably be expected to make it more difficult, or increase the time
required, to obtain any necessary consents or approvals under such Laws. 

 

(b) Each party shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, each will consult the other on, all
information relating to the other and each of their respective Affiliates
that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the 

      ##### 

  

    

transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that materials may be redacted
(x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Purchased Assets,
(y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns. 

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree to
use their reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or
competition Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the
parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date. In addition, the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation
on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing
prior to the End Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in connection with the receipt of any necessary approvals under
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, neither the Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to divest or hold separate any material assets
or business. 

  

(d) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of
any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
permit the other party to review in advance (and to consider any comments
made by the other party in relation to) any proposed communication by such
party to any Governmental Authority relating to such matters. Neither party
to this Agreement shall participate in or agree to participate in any
substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement
of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to such matters
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, telephone call or
discussion. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing
and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods,
including under the HSR Act. Each party to this Agreement will provide the
outside legal counsel for the other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between them or any of their representatives, on
the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the
other hand, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_  that materials may be redacted (x) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Purchased Assets, (y) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns. 

  

(e) Each party to this Agreement shall (i) subject to Section 5.04(d)
above, respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or
requests for additional information and documentary material received from
any Governmental Authority in connection with any antitrust or competition
matters related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) not extend any waiting period or agree to refile under the
HSR Act (except with the prior written consent of the other party hereto,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and
(iii) not enter into any agreement with 

      ##### 

  

    

any Governmental Authority agreeing not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 _Section 5.05_ _Consents_. (a) Each party hereto agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, approvals and
authorizations not contemplated by Section 5.04 that may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties further
agree as set forth in Schedule 5.05. 

 

(b) Each party hereto agrees that, in the event that any consent, approval
or authorization necessary to preserve for the Business any right or benefit
under any Contract to which BSC or any Seller is a party is not obtained
prior to the Closing, BSC will, and will cause the Sellers to, subsequent to
the Closing, cooperate with the Purchaser in attempting to obtain such
consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable. If
such consent, approval or authorization cannot be obtained, BSC shall, and
shall cause the Sellers to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the Purchaser with the rights and benefits of the affected
Contract for the term of such Contract, and, if BSC and the Sellers provide
such rights and benefits, the Purchaser, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations and burdens thereunder to the same extent provided in Schedule
2.02(a)(i) in respect of Transferred Contracts and to the extent
the obligations and burdens are not substantially different than the
obligations and burdens on BSC or Sellers under such Contract as of the
Closing Date and do not include any Excluded Liabilities set forth in
Sections 2.02(b)(i) through (xiv). 

   

 _Section 5.06_ _Retained Names and Marks_. (a) The Purchaser hereby
acknowledges that all right, title and interest in and to
the "BOSTON SCIENTIFIC", "BSCI" and "BSC" names, together with all names
that resemble the foregoing so as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake
or to deceive, and all trademarks, service marks, Internet domain names, tag
lines, logos, trade names, trade dress, packaging designs, media
branding designs, company names and other identifiers of source or goodwill
containing or incorporating any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Retained Names and Marks_ ") shall be retained by BSC or any of its
Affiliates, and that, except as expressly provided below, any and all right of
the Purchaser to use the Retained Names and Marks hereunder shall terminate
as of the Closing and shall immediately revert to BSC, along with any and all
goodwill associated therewith. The Purchaser further acknowledges that it is
not acquiring any rights to use the Retained Names and Marks, except as
expressly provided herein. 

 

(b) After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be entitled to use, solely
in connection with the operation of the Business as operated in all material
respects immediately prior to the Closing, all of its existing stocks of
signs, letterheads, invoice stock, advertisements and promotional materials,
inventory, packaging and other documents and materials (" _Existing Stock_ ")
containing the Retained Names and Marks, provided that the Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to remove, or cease using the Retained
Names and Marks (or in the case of advertisements, promotional materials,
inventory and packaging, over-label or re-sticker such Existing Stock so as
to conceal such Retained Names and Marks) as promptly as practicable after
the Closing. After the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (or
until such Existing Stock is exhausted in the case of the inventory of any
Product for which the Retained Names and Marks are embedded in such Product
as part of the manufacturing process 

      ##### 

  

    

and not reasonably capable of being stickered or labeled), the Purchaser shall
have no right to use the Retained Names and Marks hereunder and shall have
removed or obliterated all Retained Names and Marks from such Existing Stock
or ceased using such Existing Stock (or in the case of advertisements,
promotional materials, inventory and packaging, shall have over-labeled
or re-stickered such Existing Stock so as to conceal such Retained Names and
Marks). 

  

(c) Except as expressly provided in this Section 5.06, no other right to
use the Retained Names and Marks is granted by BSC to the Purchaser or its
Affiliates whether by implication or otherwise, and nothing hereunder permits
the Purchaser or its Affiliates to use the Retained Names and Marks in any
manner other than in connection with Existing Stock. The Purchaser shall
ensure that all its uses of the Retained Names and Marks as provided in this
Section 5.06 shall be only with respect to goods and services of a level of
quality commensurate with the quality of goods and services with respect to
which the Retained Names and Marks were used in the Business prior to
the Closing. Any and all goodwill generated by the use of the Retained Names
and Marks under this Section 5.06 shall inure solely to the benefit of BSC.
The Purchaser or its Affiliates shall not use the Retained Names and Marks
hereunder in any manner that may damage or tarnish the reputation of BSC or
the goodwill associated with the Retained Names and Marks. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.06 shall preclude the Purchaser and its
Affiliates from keeping records and other historical or archived documents
containing or referencing the Retained Names and Marks or referring to the
historical fact that the Business was previously conducted under the
Retained Names and Marks, provided that with respect to any such reference,
the Purchaser shall not use the Retained Names and Marks to promote any
products or services and the Purchaser shall make explicit that the Business
is no longer affiliated with BSC, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates. 

  

(d) The Purchaser agrees that BSC shall have no responsibility for claims
by third parties arising out of, or relating to, the use by the Purchaser of
any Retained Names and Marks after the Closing, except as provided under
Article VIII. In addition to any and all other available remedies, and except
as provided pursuant to Article VIII, the Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless BSC and its Affiliates, and their officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns, from and against any and all such
claims that may arise out of the use of the Retained Names and Marks by the
Purchaser (i) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Section 5.06, other than such claims that the Retained Names and Marks
infringe the Intellectual Property rights of any third party, or (ii) in
violation of or outside the scope permitted by this Section 5.06.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser
hereby acknowledges that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of
this Section 5.06, BSC, in addition to any other remedies available to it,
shall be entitled to seek a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining
order or other equivalent relief restraining the Purchaser and any of
its Affiliates from any such breach or threatened breach. 

   

 _Section 5.07_ _Notifications_. Until the Closing, each party hereto shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of any fact, change, condition,
circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware
that will or is reasonably likely to result in any breach of a representation
or warranty or covenant of such party, which breach would reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VII of this
Agreement becoming incapable of being satisfied. The delivery of notice
pursuant to this Section 5.07 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party 

   ##### 

  

 

receiving such notice or the representations or warranties of the parties or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto. 

   

 _Section 5.08_ _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Each party hereby waives compliance
by the other parties with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws of
any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to
the Purchaser. 

  

 _Section 5.09_ _Audited Special Purpose Financial Statements_. BSC has
retained Ernst and Young LLP to audit the unaudited special purpose statement
of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed of the Business for
the fiscal years ended as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009 and the
related unaudited special purpose statements of revenue and direct expenses
of the Business and prior to the Closing shall (i) deliver to the Purchaser
such audited special purpose financial statements (the " _Audited Special
Purpose Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) after the execution by the
Purchaser of such reasonable acknowledgement or non-reliance letters as BSCÂ’s
auditors may request, permit access to the work papers related thereto;
_provided_ that any information in such workpapers not pertaining to the
Business shall be redacted prior to access by the Purchaser of such
workpapers (provided that such redaction shall not impair any information
pertaining to the Business). 

  

 _Section 5.10_ _Non-Solicitation_. (a) BSC shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser or
except as expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreement, for a period of 18
months from the applicable Employee Transfer Date, directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment or hire any Transferred Employee whose employment was
transferred as of such Employee Transfer Date;  _provided_ that (i) BSC and
its Affiliates are not prohibited from employing any such person who contacts
BSC or any such Affiliate on his or her own initiative and without any direct
or indirect solicitation by BSC or such Affiliate, and (ii) the term "solicit
for employment" shall not be deemed to include general solicitations of
employment not specifically directed toward any such Person. 

 

(b) The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without
the prior written consent of BSC or except as expressly provided in any
Ancillary Agreement, for a period of (x) except as otherwise provided in
clause (y) below, 18 months from the Closing Date in the case of clause (I)
below and 12 months from the Closing Date in the case of clause (II) below,
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any individual who is
employed by BSC or any of its Affiliates as of the date hereof (or at any
time during such period) and (I) becomes known to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or any officer, director, employee, agent or advisor of
the Purchaser or its Affiliates as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or (II) is recommended as a
potential employee of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (who, when
hired, would be classified as a Manager or above in the PurchaserÂ’s
human resources system) by any of the individuals who received a Special
Retention Bonus Program Participation Notice as described in Section 6.03 of
the Disclosure Schedule, to the individual with responsibility for hiring
decisions on behalf of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or (y) 18
months from the Cork Manufacturing Transfer Date, the Fremont Manufacturing
Transfer Date or the West Valley Manufacturing Transfer Date (as applicable),
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any individual (other
than the Transferred Employees) who (A) is employed in the Cork Facility or
the Fremont manufacturing facility by BSC or any of its Affiliates as of the
Cork Manufacturing Transfer Date or the Fremont 

      ##### 

  

    

Manufacturing Transfer Date, respectively, or (B) was employed in the West
Valley Facility prior to the West Valley Manufacturing Transfer Date and is
employed elsewhere by BSC or any of its Affiliates as of the West Valley
Manufacturing Transfer Date; _provided_ that (i) the Purchaser and its
Affiliates are not prohibited from employing any such person who contacts
the Purchaser or any such Affiliate on his or her own initiative and without
any direct or indirect solicitation by the Purchaser or such Affiliate, and
(ii) the term "solicit for employment" or "solicitation" shall not be deemed
to include general solicitations of employment not specifically directed
toward any such person. 

   

 _Section 5.11_ _Non-Competition_ (a) Except as otherwise specifically
provided in any of the Ancillary Agreements, for a period of three years
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world, use in the
Restricted Areas, except in those Restricted Areas described in clauses (d),

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in any of the Ancillary
Agreements, for either (x) a period of five years after the Closing Date or
(y) a period of three years after the last Facility Transfer Date, whichever
is longer, BSC shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, anywhere in the world, engage in the Business or, without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, own an
interest in, manage, operate, join, control or participate in or be connected
with, as a member, agent, partner, stockholder or investor, any Person
anywhere that engages in the Business; _provided_ that, for the purposes of
this Section 5.11(b), (i) the ownership of securities having no more than five
percent of the outstanding voting power of any such Person which are listed

than ten (10) percent of the outstanding ownership interest in any fund which
invests in, manages or operates such Person shall not be deemed to be in

such fund is not to make investments in Persons that engage in the Business,
and (B) BSC or the Affiliate thereof owning such interest does not control or
exercise any influence over such Person, and (ii) BSC and its Affiliates
shall not be prohibited from acquiring shares of capital stock or assets of

the Acquired Business that engages in the Business no later than twelve (12)
months after either the date of such acquisition or the last day of the last

unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction by a final determination
of a court or any other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, the
parties agree that: (i) such determination will not affect the validity or
enforceability of (A) the offending term or provision in any other situation
or in any other jurisdiction or (B) the remaining terms and provisions of
this Section 5.11 in any situation in any jurisdiction; (ii) the offending
term or provision will be reformed rather than voided and the court or
Governmental Authority making such determination will have the power
to reduce the scope, duration or geographical area of any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to
replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable provision, in order to render
the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 5.11 enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; and (iii) the restrictive
covenants set forth in this Section 5.11 will be enforceable as so modified. 

  

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates
from reprocessing any medical device for any purpose for use in any field;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not permit the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to market or promote any Product described in clause (i) of
Section 5.11(a) in a manner that violates Section 5.11(a). 

   

 _Section 5.12_ _Collection of Accounts Receivables; Inventory_. 

 

(a) To the extent any amounts with respect to Accounts Receivable are
received by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that arise from the
conduct of the Business prior to 11:59 pm on the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date or by BSC or any of its Affiliates that arise from the
conduct of the Business after such time, the Purchaser or BSC, as the case may
be, shall promptly remit such amounts to the other. 

  

(b) BSC covenants and agrees that the value of gross finished goods
inventory included in the Purchased Assets as of the Closing Date, determined
in a manner consistent with the Unaudited Special Purpose Financial
Statements, shall not be less than the amount set forth on
Schedule 5.12(b). 

   

 _Section 5.13_ _Further Action_. The parties hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to
do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law, the Transferred Contracts or otherwise, and to execute
and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 5.14_ _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. BSC and the
Purchaser will provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining any liability for Taxes
or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit
or other proceeding in respect of Taxes relating to this Agreement,
the Purchased Assets or the Business. Such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules and related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities; 
_provided_ that in no event shall BSC or the Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates be required to provide access to or copies of any
income Tax Returns of BSC, the Purchaser, or any such Affiliate including the
Sellers. BSC and the Purchaser will make themselves (and their respective
employees) available, on a mutually convenient basis, to provide explanations
of any documents or information provided under this Section 5.14. Each of BSC
and the Purchaser will retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers and
all material records or other documents in its possession (or in the
possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters relevant to
the Purchased Assets for the taxable period first ending after the Closing
and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of
the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns
and other documents relate, without regard to extensions, or (ii) six years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such
time, before BSC or the Purchaser shall dispose of any such documents in its
possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the other party shall be
given the opportunity, after 90 daysÂ’ prior written notice, to remove and
retain all or any part of such documents as such other party may select (at
such other partyÂ’s expense). Any information obtained under this Section 5.14
shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding. Any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in furnishing such information or assistance pursuant to this Section 5.14
shall be borne by the party requesting it. 

  

 _Section 5.15_ _Conveyance Taxes_. Conveyance Taxes attributable to the
sale of the Purchased Assets or the Business shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by BSC and the Sellers when
due. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall complete and execute a
resale or other exemption certificate with respect to inventory and similar
items sold hereunder, and shall provide the other party with an executed copy
thereof. BSC, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts and
cooperate in good faith to exempt the sale and transfer of the Purchased
Assets from any such Conveyance Taxes. The Purchaser, BSC and the Sellers
shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of all necessary Tax Returns or
other documents with respect to all such Conveyance Taxes; _provided_ ,
however, that in the event any such Tax Return requires execution by
any Seller, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to such Seller a copy of
such Tax Return at least five (5) days before the due date thereof, and such
Seller shall promptly execute such Tax Return and deliver it to the
Purchaser, which shall cause it to be filed. The parties shall
provide reimbursement for any Tax described in this Section 5.15 that is paid
by the other parties as may be necessary such that the Purchaser, on the one
hand, and BSC and the Sellers, on the other each pay fifty percent (50%) of
such Conveyance Taxes. 

  

 _Section 5.16_ _VAT and Recoverable Taxes_. Save as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, Recoverable Taxes shall be borne entirely by the party
entitled to 

   ##### 

  

  

recover such Taxes under applicable Law. VAT, to the extent not considered
Recoverable Taxes, shall be paid by the Purchaser on any supplies effected
for VAT purposes under or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.16. The Purchaser, BSC and
the Sellers shall cooperate to file any Tax Return relating to VAT or
Recoverable Taxes, to the extent necessary. To the extent that any VAT is
chargeable on any Purchased Assets transferred pursuant to this Agreement,
the transferring person (the " _Supplier_ ") shall deliver to the recipient
(the " _Recipient_ "): (i) a valid VAT invoice where required by applicable
Law or practice and (ii) any other documentation as may be reasonably
requested by the Recipient to assist it to recover the VAT chargeable or
payable, in each case, in such form and within such timing as may be required
by Law. An amount equal to the amount of VAT chargeable or payable by the
Supplier on the Purchased Assets transferred shall be paid in addition to the
consideration provided in this Agreement, by the Recipient to the Supplier
within five (5) Business Days of receipt of a valid VAT invoice (or where no
invoice is required, within five (5) Business Days of demand) or, if
later, two (2) Business Days before the date on which the obligation to
account for VAT would have had to be discharged in order to avoid liability
to interest or a charge or penalty. The Supplier shall account for all
amounts in respect of VAT paid to it by the Recipient to the appropriate
Tax Authorities in compliance with applicable Laws. The Supplier and the
Recipient shall use reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to
determine the appropriate rate of VAT and to exempt the transfer of the
Purchased Assets from any VAT and/or, where available, to apply for
a specific VAT-relief for a "Transfer Of a Going Concern" (TOGC). This shall
include, but not be limited to, cooperation to ensure that the transfer of
the Purchased Assets is treated as the transfer of a business or part thereof
under Articles 19 and 29 of the VAT Directive (2006/112/EC) and is not a
supply of goods or the supply of services. In the event that VAT is
incorrectly charged by the Supplier, and the Supplier is entitled to recover
the amount of incorrectly charged VAT, the Supplier shall use its reasonable
best efforts to recover such amount and shall pay such recovered amount over
to the Recipient within three (3) Business Days after receipt thereof. 

  

 _Section 5.17_ _Proration of Taxes_. Except as provided in Section 5.15 or
5.16, the portion of any Tax payable with respect to a Straddle Period that
is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date or Facility Transfer Date applicable to the Purchased Asset or
Transferred Employee (or, with respect to any Deferred Asset or Deferred
Closing Transfer Employee, the applicable Deferred Closing Date) shall be (i)
in the case of property and similar ad valorem Taxes and any other Taxes not
described in clause (ii) below relating to the Purchased Assets or the
Business, equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during
the Straddle Period that fall on or prior to the Closing Date, Facility
Transfer Date or Deferred Closing Date, as applicable, and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the
case of sales and similar Taxes, employment Taxes and other Taxes that are
readily apportionable based on an actual or deemed closing of the books
relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business, computed as if such
taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date or
Facility Transfer Date applicable to the Purchased Asset or Transferred
Employee or, with respect to any Deferred Asset or Deferred Closing Transfer
Employee, the applicable Deferred Closing Date. If any Taxes subject to
proration pursuant to the preceding sentence are paid by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, or BSC or its Affiliates, on the other hand,
then the proportionate amount of such Taxes for which the non-paying party is
responsible under the terms of this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement shall be promptly reimbursed to the paying party by the non-paying
party after the payment of such Taxes. Any refunds, credits or similar
benefits relating to such Taxes shall be allocated between the Purchaser and
BSC in the same manner that the Taxes to which the refunds, credits or
similar benefits relate were paid, and BSC shall promptly pay to the
Purchaser, or the Purchaser shall promptly pay to BSC, as the case may be,
the portion of such refund, credit or similar benefit received or realized
that is allocable to the other party hereunder. 

   

 _Section 5.18_ _BSC Compensation Tax Items_. (a) BSC and the Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that BSC and its Affiliates will take into account any
BSC Compensation Tax Items in computing liability for U.S. federal, state and
local income Taxes (and shall be responsible for all withholding and
information reporting with respect to such amounts), and that neither the
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will take into account any such BSC
Compensation Tax Items in computing liability for such Taxes except as
provided in this Section 5.18 or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The
same approach shall be followed for purposes of computing liability for Taxes
outside the United States, except to the extent the Laws of a particular
jurisdiction provide to the contrary.  

 

(b) If BSC determines that, under applicable Law, neither BSC nor any of
its Affiliates is permitted to take into account any BSC Compensation Tax
Item, and the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates determines in good faith
that it is permitted or required to take into account such BSC Compensation
Tax Item in computing its income Tax liability, which determination shall
be conclusive and binding on the parties, then the Purchaser shall calculate
in good faith and pay to BSC the amount of any actual income Tax savings
realized in the year such BSC Compensation Tax Item is taken into account as
a result of the BSC Compensation Tax Item, it being understood that an actual
income Tax saving shall only be treated as occurring in a year to the extent
that the PurchaserÂ’s actual income Tax payable in respect of such year
without taking the BSC Compensation Tax Item into account is greater than the
amount of actual income tax that would have been payable in such year had
such BSC Compensation Tax Item not been taken into account. The Purchaser
shall make such payment, reduced by all expenses (including any employment
Taxes) incurred by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with
this Section 5.18, to BSC, and provide BSC with copies of the calculations of
such actual income Tax savings, within ninety (90) days following the filing
of the PurchaserÂ’s income tax Return for the year in which such
BSC Compensation Tax Item is realized. The PurchaserÂ’s calculation of such
Tax savings shall be binding and conclusive on the parties in the absence of
manifest error. In the event that the PurchaserÂ’s deduction of any BSC
Compensation Tax Item is disallowed by any Governmental Authority in any
audit, litigation, proceeding or otherwise, BSC shall repay to Purchaser the
amount Purchaser determines it had previously paid to BSC in respect of such
disallowed BSC Compensation Tax Item, together with any penalty, interest or
other charges imposed by any Governmental Authority in connection with such
disallowance and any other out of pocket expenses incurred by the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates. 

  

(c) In connection with any BSC Compensation Tax Items, BSC and the
Purchaser agree to provide each other with such cooperation and information
as either of them reasonably may request of the other, as provided under
Section 5.14, which cooperation shall include providing information
with respect to information reporting and withholding requirements applicable
to the exercise by Transferred Employees and Former Employees of 

      ##### 

  

    

options to acquire BSC capital stock and the coordination of the responsible
party for such reporting and withholding requirements. 

   

 _Section 5.19_ _Tax Treatment of Deferred Transfers_. The parties agree
that (i) with respect to any Purchased Asset that is to be transferred to
the Purchaser pursuant to the Separation Agreement and (ii) with respect to
any Deferred Asset that is to be transferred to the Purchaser on a Deferred
Closing Date, a completed sale shall not be treated as occurring for Tax
purposes until the relevant Facility Transfer Date or Deferred Closing Date,
as applicable, on which legal title to the Purchased Asset passes to the
Purchaser. Neither the Purchaser nor BSC shall take (or cause any Affiliate
to take) any position to the contrary in any Tax Return or other Tax filing,
or in connection with a Tax audit, litigation or other proceeding. 

  

 _Section 5.20_ _Successor Employer_. BSC, the Sellers and the Purchaser
shall, to the extent possible, treat the Purchaser as a "successor employer"
and BSC and the Sellers as "predecessors," within the meaning of
Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, with respect to Transferred
Employees for purposes of Taxes imposed under the United States Federal
Unemployment Tax Act, as amended, or the United States Federal Insurance
Contributions Act, as amended. Each of the Purchaser, BSC and the Sellers
agrees to adopt the "Standard Procedure" described in IRS Revenue Procedure
2004-53 and furnish a separate IRS Form W-2 to each Transferred Employee with
respect to wages paid by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and BSC and the
Sellers, on the other. 

  

 _Section 5.21_ _Risk of Loss_. The risk of loss or damage by fire or other
casualty to any of the Transferred Sites or Tangible Personal Property before
the Closing is assumed by BSC. In the event that any of the Transferred Sites
or Tangible Personal Property shall suffer any fire or casualty or any injury
before the Closing, BSC agrees to (i) repair the damage (or cause the damage
to be repaired by a landlord, as applicable) at its sole cost and expense
before the Closing Date, (ii) assign to the Purchaser the proceeds of all
insurance coverage in respect of such loss so long as such proceeds are
a reasonable approximation of the cost of such repairs, or (iii) make an
appropriate reduction in the Initial Purchase Price based on a reasonable
approximation of the cost of such repair. Except as otherwise provided in the
Separation Agreement, the risk of loss or damage by fire or other casualty to
any of the Transferred Sites or Tangible Personal Property after the Closing
is assumed by the Purchaser. 

  

 _Section 5.22_ _Intercompany Arrangements_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary (other than pursuant to any
Ancillary Agreement) as of the Closing, all services, commitments, agreements
or other arrangements that existed prior to the Closing between BSC and any
Seller or any other Affiliate of BSC with respect to the Business shall cease
or be terminated. Any such cessation or termination shall be without penalty
to, and shall not require any action by, the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates. 

  

 _Section 5.23_ _Mixed Contracts_. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the
parties in writing, any Contract (other than any Transferred Contract) to
which BSC or any Seller is a party prior to the Closing, in each case, that
inures to the benefit or burden of each of the Business and the BSC Other
Businesses, including those Contracts listed on Schedule 5.23 of the
Disclosure Schedule (a " _Mixed Contract_ "), shall, to the extent
commercially reasonable, be separated on or after the Closing so that each of
the Purchaser and BSC shall be entitled to the 

   ##### 

  

 

rights and benefits and shall assume the related portion of any Liabilities
inuring to their respective businesses. If any Mixed Contract cannot be so
separated, BSC and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Affiliates to, take such other commercially reasonable efforts to
cause (i) the rights and benefits associated with that portion of each Mixed
Contract that relates to the Business to be enjoyed by the Purchaser; (ii)
the Liabilities associated with that portion of each Mixed Contract that
relates to the Business to be borne by the Purchaser; (iii) the rights and
benefits associated with that portion of each Mixed Contract that relates
to the BSC Other Businesses to be enjoyed by BSC; and (iv) the Liabilities
associated with that portion of each Mixed Contract that relates to the BSC
Other Businesses to be borne by BSC. The costs of such separation shall be
borne by the parties in proportion to the rights and benefits inuring to each
of them under the Mixed Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Liabilities to be borne by the Purchaser under
any Mixed Contracts hereunder shall not include and the Purchaser shall not
assume or have any responsibility for, and BSC shall, and shall cause the
Sellers to, retain and be responsible for paying, performing and
discharging when due, any Excluded Liabilities set forth in Sections
2.02(b)(i) through (xiv). 

   

 _Section 5.24_ _Schedules and Exhibits to Certain Ancillary Agreements;
OUS Transfer Agreements_. (a) The parties acknowledge that the schedules and
exhibits specified in Schedule 5.24(a) that are attached to the forms of the
Separation Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Supply Agreement
and the Sales Agent Agreement are subject to modification between the date
hereof and the Closing Date to the extent agreed by the parties, including to
provide for greater detail or specificity regarding the subject matter
thereof. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith any such modifications
to such schedules and exhibits prior to the Closing Date; _provided_  that
the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, subject to their compliance
with such obligation to negotiate in good faith, failure to agree on any
modifications to such schedules and exhibits will not excuse either party
from the performance of any of its obligations hereunder, including its
obligation to effect the Closing on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in Article VII. 

 

(b) BSC and the Purchaser agree to negotiate in good faith to make any
changes necessary to the form of OUS Transfer Agreement attached hereto to
conform to applicable local Law, provided that the economic and legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not affected
by such changes. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and
any OUS Transfer Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail;
_provided_ that in the case of any inconsistency that relates solely to the
timing and specific terms of the transfer of title to one or more Purchased
Assets in a particular jurisdiction, the OUS Transfer Agreement in
that particular jurisdiction shall prevail. 

   

 _Section 5.25_ _IP Docket; Assignment Documents_. (a) Prior to the
Closing, BSC shall provide the Purchaser with a schedule that lists all of
the registration, maintenance, annuity and renewal fees, and corresponding
due dates, that must be paid in order to maintain the Transferred
Intellectual Property during the sixty (60) day period following the Closing.
Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, BSC shall also deliver to the
Purchaser all information and documents in its possession, including all
reasonably available electronically stored information and documents, for the
Purchaser to maintain continuity of prosecution of all pending applications
within the Transferred Intellectual Property. 

   ##### 

  

 

(b) Following the Closing Date and upon the written request of the
Purchaser, BSC hereby agrees, at its sole expense, to use and shall cause its
Sellers to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain and deliver
to Purchaser any existing patent assignment or other documents demonstrating
ownership by BSC or a Seller of the Transferred Intellectual Property, to the
extent not already provided pursuant to Section 2.06(d). 

   

 _Section 5.26_ _Additional Patents_. (a) The Purchaser shall within ten
(10) years following the Closing Date, notify BSC in writing of any patent
issued, or patent application filed, prior to the Closing Date owned by or
licensed to BSC or the Sellers as of the Closing Date that: (x) is neither
included in the Business Intellectual Property, nor licensed to the Purchaser
pursuant to the Seller IP License Agreement; and (y) the Purchaser determines
may be infringed by the import, use, manufacture, offer to sell or sale of ("
_Covers_ ") a Transferred Product (which, as used in this Section 5.26, has
the meaning assigned to it in the Technology Transfer Agreement), as such
Transferred Product exists in, or is used or made by, the Business as
conducted by BSC or the Sellers as of the Closing Date. The rights in any
such patent or patent issuing from such application, as between the
Parties, shall be assessed as follows: 

  

(i) if any claim of such patent Covers a Transferred Product, or method of
using or making a Transferred Product, as such Transferred Product exists in,
or is used or made by, the Business as conducted by BSC or the Sellers as of
the Closing Date, and does not also Cover another commercialized or
development phase device, or the using or making of such a device, of BSC or
any of its Affiliates existing on or before the Closing Date, then BSC and
the Purchaser shall promptly execute (1) an assignment transferring ownership
of or the license to such patent to the Purchaser, and (2) an amendment to
the Purchaser IP License Agreement adding such patent as a Licensed Patent or
Third Party Licensed Patent thereunder, as applicable, which assignment
and amendment will be effective as of the Closing Date;

    

(ii) if any claim of such patent Covers a Transferred Product, or method
of using or making a Transferred Product, as such Transferred Product exists
in, or is used or made by, the Business as conducted by BSC or the Sellers of
the Closing Date, and also Covers another commercialized or development phase
device, or the using or making of such a device, of BSC or any of its
Affiliates existing on or before the Closing Date, then such patent will be
added to Schedule A or C of the Seller IP License Agreement, as applicable,
and BSC and the Purchaser shall promptly execute an amendment to the Seller
IP License Agreement, which amendment will be effective as of the Closing
Date; and

    

(iii) if no claim of such patent Covers a Transferred Product, or method
of using or making a Transferred Product, as such Transferred Product exists
in, or is used or made by, the Business as conducted by BSC or the Sellers as
of the Closing Date, then BSC or the Seller shall retain the exclusive right,
title and interest in any such patent.

         ##### 

  

     

(b) If a dispute arises under this Section 5.26, regarding (i) whether or
not the patent or patent application identified by the Purchaser Covers a
Transferred Product, as such Transferred Product exists in, or is used or
made by, the Business as conducted by BSC or the Sellers as of the Closing
Date; and, if so, (ii) whether or not any claim of any such patent satisfies
any one of clauses (i) Â– (iii) of this Section 5.26, that dispute, as well as
the selection of a single arbitrator to arbitrate the dispute, will be
arbitrated before the American Arbitration Association in Delaware under
their Resolution of Patent Disputes rules in a binding, non-
appealable arbitration proceeding. 

  

(c) If BSC or any of the Sellers chooses or is required by an arbitrator to
assign or license the rights to a patent or patent issuing from an
application to the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.26, then (i) BSC and
the Sellers shall have no liability (x) for failure of such identified
patents or applications to be so included in the Business Intellectual
Property or licensed pursuant to the Seller IP License Agreement, or (y)
arising out of BSCÂ’s or the SellersÂ’ use or encumbering of such identified
patents or applications prior to receipt of such written notice from the
Purchaser, (ii) such assignment or license shall only be granted to the
fullest extent (if any) that BSC and the Sellers have the right to grant such
assignment or (sub)license as of the date of such assessment, and (iii) any
royalties or fees paid or payable to BSC or any of the Sellers by any third
party following the Closing Date for a license or transfer of any
other interest, to the extent such royalties or fees are directly
attributable to the practice by such third party of a claim of or the
transfer of, as applicable, any patent that is required to be assigned (but
not licensed) to the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.26, shall be paid to
the Purchaser as of the date of notice given to BSC by the Purchaser. 

   

ARTICLE VI 

   

EMPLOYEE MATTERS 

   

 _Section 6.01_ _Offers of Employment and Automatic Transfers_. (a) Except
to the extent otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, (i) as
of each applicable Employee Transfer Date, the Purchaser shall, solely as
required by applicable Transfer Law, automatically become the employer of the
Corresponding Transfer Date Employees and (ii) as of each applicable Employee
Transfer Date, and subject to (A) PurchaserÂ’s satisfactory completion
of reasonable drug testing and reasonable criminal background check screening
and (B) OIG debar checking, sales representative credentialing and work
authorization (including to Form I-9 documentation), as applicable and
reasonably necessary, (C) execution of non-compete/confidentiality agreements
with terms no more restrictive to the applicable employee than those
currently in effect with respect to similarly situated employees of the
Purchaser and (D) any other documents as required by applicable Law to effect
employment (collectively, the " _Purchaser Â’s Employment Contingencies_"),
the Purchaser shall offer employment to the Corresponding Transfer Date
Employees whose employment is not required to be transferred automatically
pursuant to Transfer Law. In the event that the Purchaser intends not to
offer employment to a Corresponding Transfer Date Employee due to a purported
failure by such Corresponding Transfer Date Employee to satisfy the
PurchaserÂ’s Employment Contingencies, then the Purchaser shall promptly
inform BSC in writing of such intention and the specific grounds
therefor, and shall consider in good faith any objection BSC may have to
the 

   ##### 

  

 

Purchaser not offering employment to such Corresponding Transfer Date
Employee. Such offer or transfer of employment initially shall be, subject to
applicable Law, at salary or other base compensation rate (including sales
commission rates) that is no less favorable to such Employee than the rate in
effect immediately prior to such applicable Employee Transfer Date. In
addition, the Purchaser shall offer employment at a location that is no more
than thirty-five (35) miles from the employeeÂ’s principal place of work
immediately prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date. The Purchaser
shall commence and conclude all activities necessary to effectuate
satisfaction of the Purchaser Employment Contingencies with respect to the
Corresponding Transfer Date Employees whose employment is not required to be
transferred automatically pursuant to Transfer Law at its own cost and within
the sixty (60) days prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date or,
solely with respect to the Closing Transfer Employees, within the period of
time commencing on the date hereof and concluding on the Closing, provided
that BSC and the Sellers shall have provided access to the applicable
Corresponding Transfer Date Employees, and all employment records and
files relating thereto, no later than sixty (60) days prior to the applicable
Employee Transfer Date and, solely with respect to the Closing Transfer
Employees, shall have provided to the Purchaser immediately following the
date hereof, access to the Closing Transfer Employees, and all
employment records and files relating thereto. BSC and the Sellers shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Corresponding Transfer Date
Employees to accept such offers of employment that are required to be made by
the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.01(a). In the event that
the Purchaser fails to comply with any of the requirements of this Section
6.01(a), other than to the extent such failure is attributable to the failure
of BSC or its Affiliates to comply with applicable Transfer Laws or the
provisions of Section 6.01(b) or the Transition Services Agreement, the
Purchaser shall be responsible for and indemnify, defend and hold harmless BSC
and its Affiliates against any cost, obligation or liability arising
therefrom under WARN (or any comparable non-U.S. Law) and the BSC Severance
Pay and Layoff Notification Plan, as Amended and Restated, effective as of
August 1, 2008, or any other applicable Plan; _provided_ that BSC and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for and indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Purchaser against any cost, obligation or liability to the extent
attributable to a failure of BSC or its Affiliates to comply with applicable
Transfer Law or the provisions of Section 6.01(b) or the Transition Services
Agreement or arising from the inability of any applicant or employee to
meet the PurchaserÂ’s Employment Contingencies to the PurchaserÂ’s
satisfaction, including any claims brought by individuals for failure to
become employed or continue in employment with the PurchaserÂ’s Employment
Contingencies. As used herein, " _Transferred Employee_ " means
each Corresponding Transfer Date Employee who accepts such offer or whose
employment transfers automatically under applicable Transfer Laws and who, in
either case, actually commences employment with the Purchaser as of the
applicable Employee Transfer Date. With respect to any employee who is on
short-term disability leave, workersÂ’ compensation leave, or other authorized
leave of absence as of the date of the applicable Employee Transfer Date and
who accepts such offer of employment with the Purchaser or whose employment
transfers automatically, such employment with the Purchaser shall commence
and such employee shall become a Transferred Employee as of the date of such
employee returns to active employment, subject to applicable Law.  

  

(b) _Cooperation_. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each
other as may be or may become required, necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or applicable Law,
including applicable Transfer Law, to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, or as may be agreed to by 

      ##### 

  

    

the parties hereof, including assistance in any meeting with, filing with or
notification to, or obtaining any consent, authorization, order or approval
of, (i) any Corresponding Transfer Date Employee, (ii) any works council,
labor union, or employee representative, or (iii) any Governmental Authority.
BSC and the Sellers shall cooperate with the Purchaser in the
PurchaserÂ’s recruitment of the Corresponding Transfer Date Employees,
including (x) permitting the Purchaser reasonable and prompt access to the
Corresponding Transfer Date Employees to communicate to such employees any
information concerning employment offers and employment with the Purchaser
in accordance with this Agreement, (y) providing on a timely basis any
notices required of BSC or its Affiliates under applicable Transfer Law and,
to the extent such notice addresses matters effective after the applicable
Employee Transfer Date, consulting with Purchaser in respect thereof and
(z) subject to applicable Law, providing prompt access to personnel files,
organizational succession planning, talent review and development planning
documents of such employees. BSC and the Sellers shall use all reasonable
efforts to maintain favorable relations with the Corresponding Transfer Date
Employees from the date hereof up to and including the applicable Employee
Transfer Date, including taking all steps reasonably necessary to retain the
services and goodwill of each such employee, and shall refrain from taking
any action that could harm or damage relations with the Corresponding
Transfer Date Employees or that could cause any such employee to terminate
the employeeÂ’s service with BSC or any Seller prior to the applicable
Corresponding Transfer Date;  _provided_ that nothing herein shall be
construed as preventing BSC from enforcing its employment policies against
Corresponding Transfer Date Employees in accordance with its
customary practices. 

   

 _Section 6.02_ _Employee Benefits_. (a) Except as contemplated by Section 6.03 or the Transition Services Agreement, as of the applicable Employee Transfer Date, each Transferred Employee shall cease to be covered under the Plans. Except as otherwise set forth herein or in the Transition Services Agreement, as of the applicable Employee Transfer Date, the Transferred Employees shall be covered by the employee benefit plans of the Purchaser. For a period from the date of the applicable Employee Transfer Date until eighteen (18) months following such date, the Purchaser shall provide the Transferred Employees (i) who are employed in the United States by the Purchaser with a level of employee benefits substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the Seller, and (ii) who are employed by the Purchaser outside the United States with a level of employee benefits substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser, provided that, in the case of either (i) or (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, "employee benefits," as used herein, shall not include any bonus or incentive compensation benefits. 

 

(b) (i) Provided that BSCÂ’s incentive and bonus plans applicable to the
Transferred Employees who will be employed by the Purchaser are listed in
Section 6.02(b)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Incentive Plans_ "),
the Purchaser shall honor the percentage of target amount for
each Transferred Employee, under the terms of the Incentive Plans (A) with
respect to Closing Transfer Employees, through December 31, 2011, (B) with
respect to the Cork Transfer Employees, the Fremont Transfer Employees, the
West Valley Transfer Employees, the Deferred Closing Transfer Employees
and the Delayed Transfer Employees, if the applicable Employee Transfer Date
has occurred on or prior to September 30 of a given calendar year, through
the end of such calendar year, and (C) with respect to the Cork Transfer
Employees, the Fremont Transfer Employees, the West Valley
Transfer Employees, the Deferred Closing 

      ##### 

  

    

Transfer Employees and the Delayed Transfer Employees, if the applicable
Employee Transfer Date has occurred on or following October 1 of a given
calendar year, through the end of the calendar year following the calendar
year in which the applicable Employee Transfer Date occurred (in the case of
each of (A), (B) and (C) hereof, the " _Incentive Compensation
Continuation Period_ "). The Purchaser shall be responsible for payments that
are earned by the applicable Transferred Employees pursuant to the terms of
the Incentive Plans during the Incentive Compensation Continuation Period,
even if any such payment is required to be made during the year following
such Incentive Compensation Continuation Period. Following such Incentive
Compensation Continuation Period, the applicable Transferred Employees shall
be covered under a bonus or incentive plan of the Purchaser that is provided
to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser to the extent applicable. 

   

(ii) An amount equal to at least one hundred percent (100%) of the
aggregate target incentive pool for the Business as set forth in the The BSC
2010 Performance Incentive Plan (the " _PIP_ ") for the 2010 fiscal year
attributable to each Closing Transfer Employee on Section 6.02(b)(ii) of the
Disclosure Schedule (the " _2010 Bonus Pool"_ ) shall be paid to the Closing
Transfer Employees identified on Section 6.02(b)(ii) of the Disclosure
Schedule. BSC shall pay a percentage portion of the 2010 Bonus Pool equal to
the greater of (i) fifty percent (50%) and (ii) a percentage equal to the
percentage of the 2010 Bonus Pool that would be earned by the Closing
Transfer Employees based on actual performance as determined in good faith
following the end of the PIP performance year by BSC in its sole discretion,
and, to the extent not paid by BSC, on or before March 15, 2011, the
Purchaser shall pay (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to pay) the
remainder, provided that, in no event shall Purchaser be responsible for
paying in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the target bonus amount designated
for each Closing Transfer Employee on Section 6.02(b)(ii) of the Disclosure
Schedule. No later than March 2, 2011, BSC shall provide Purchaser with a
list of each Closing Transfer Employee on Section 6.02(b)(ii) of the
Disclosure Schedule and the corresponding amount of bonus that has been paid
by BSC to such Closing Transfer Employee and the amount of bonus to be paid
by Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.02(b)(ii)
shall apply only to those Closing Transfer Employees identified on Section
6.02(b)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule and no other Transferred Employees and
shall apply in respect of 2010 only, and except as otherwise provided in this
Section 6.02(b) or the Transition Services Agreement, neither Purchaser nor
its Affiliates shall have any obligation in respect of wage payments to
Transferred Employees in respect of the period preceding the Closing.

    

(iii) With respect to payments due under any sales retention bonus program
of BSC or its Affiliates that is identified on Section 6.02(b)(iii) of the
Disclosure Schedule, the Purchaser shall make payments to Transferred
Employees, as and when they otherwise become due under such program following
the Closing Date, equal to the amount otherwise due under such program
(exclusive of amounts attributable to fringe or similar benefits) multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the applicable
retention period following the Closing Date and the denominator of

   ##### 

  

    

which is the number of days in the retention period; _provided_ that in no
event shall the aggregate bonus amount on which PurchaserÂ’s payment
obligation under this Section 6.02(b)(iii) is determined (before application
of the proration fraction described in the preceding provisions of this
Section 6.02(b)(iii)) exceed $2,150,000.

   

(c) For a period from the date of the applicable Employee Transfer Date
until twelve (12) months following such date (the " _Severance Plan
Continuation Period_ "), the Purchaser shall honor the terms of the severance
plans applicable to the Transferred Employees who are employed by the
Purchaser, provided that such plans are listed in Section 6.02(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule, and following such Severance Plan Continuation Period,
the applicable Transferred Employees shall be covered under a severance plan
of the Purchaser that is provided to similarly situated employees of the
Purchaser, to the extent applicable. 

  

(d) Each Transferred Employee shall (without prejudice to any rights under
relevant Transfer Laws or other applicable Laws relating to deemed continuity
of service) receive credit for services with BSC and its Affiliates and
predecessors under the PurchaserÂ’s employee benefit plans to the extent of
participation therein for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual
solely to the extent such credit was provided to such Transferred Employee
under the applicable Plan as of immediately prior to the applicable Employee
Transfer Date and _provided_ that in no event shall such service be credited
to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits or the funding
thereof, or cause a Transferred Employee to receive any benefit whatsoever
other than additional eligibility, vesting or benefit accrual service credits
under PurchaserÂ’s employee benefit plans (to the extent of participation
therein), to the extent applicable. 

   

 _Section 6.03_ _Existing Agreements_. From and after the applicable Employee Transfer Date, the Purchaser hereby assumes and shall honor the agreements listed in Section 6.03 of the Disclosure Schedule, subject to any amendment or modification agreed to between the Purchaser and the applicable employee who is a party to such agreement. 

  

 _Section 6.04_ _WARN_. The Purchaser shall be responsible for any obligation with respect to the Transferred Employees under the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of 1988 and any applicable state or local equivalent arising or accruing after the applicable Employee Transfer Date (collectively, " _WARN_ ") and any comparable non-U.S. Law. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.01(a), BSC shall be responsible for any such obligation arising or accruing before the applicable Employee Transfer Date. On or before the Closing Date, BSC and the Sellers shall provide a list of the name and site of employment of any and all employees of Seller who have experienced, or will experience, an employment loss or layoff Â– as defined by WARN or any comparable non-U.S. law requiring notice to employees in the event of a closing or layoff Â– within ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date. BSC shall update this list up to and including the Closing Date. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in good faith to determine whether any notification may be required under WARN as a result of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 6.05_ _COBRA_. BSC shall be responsible for the administration of and shall retain any and all obligations and liabilities for continuation coverage under the 

   ##### 

  

 

Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_
"), with respect to the Transferred Employees and their dependents and
beneficiaries for "qualifying events" occurring on or prior to the date on
which the Transferred Employee becomes a Transferred Employee (for purposes
of clarity, to the extent such Transferred Employees are covered under an
employee benefit plan providing for such COBRA continuation benefits), and
the Purchaser shall be responsible for all obligations and liabilities for
COBRA continuation coverage for Transferred Employees and their dependents
and beneficiaries with respect to "qualifying events" occurring after the
date on which the Transferred Employee becomes a Transferred Employee (for
purposes of clarity, to the extent such Transferred Employees are covered
under an employee benefit plan providing for COBRA continuation benefits). 

   

 _Section 6.06_ _401(k) Plans_. (a) Effective as of the applicable Employee Transfer Date, no Transferred Employee shall actively participate in BSCÂ’s 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (" _BSC Â’s 401(k) Plan_"). On the date of the applicable Employee Transfer Date, Transferred Employees who participate in BSCÂ’s 401(k) Plan shall immediately be 100% vested in their individual account balances under BSCÂ’s 401(k) Plan. 

 

(b) As soon as administratively practicable following the date of the
applicable Employee Transfer Date, BSC shall advise such Transferred
Employees who participated in BSCÂ’s 401(k) Plan of their right to elect to
receive a distribution of, or to directly rollover, their individual account
balances in BSCÂ’s 401(k) Plan. To the extent permitted by Law and provided
that the Purchaser is reasonably satisfied that BSCÂ’s 401(k) Plan is
qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, as soon as
practicable following the date of the applicable Employee Transfer Date, such
account balances may be transferred by Transferred Employees to a defined
contribution retirement plan maintained by the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Â’s
401(k) Plan_") in a direct rollover or rollover contribution. Service of each
Transferred Employee prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date which was
recognized under BSCÂ’s 401(k) Plan shall be credited to such Transferred
Employee for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the PurchaserÂ’s 401(k)
Plan. Prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date, the Purchaser shall
amend the PurchaserÂ’s 401(k) Plan to the extent necessary to accept direct
rollovers from BSCÂ’s 401(k) Plan and to permit Transferred Employees to make
rollover contributions to the PurchaserÂ’s 401(k) Plan. 

   

 _Section 6.07_ _Accrued Vacation_. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, BSC shall pay to each Transferred Employee, as soon as administratively practicable, but no later than two (2) pay periods following the applicable Employee Transfer Date, a cash payment reflecting the value of such employeeÂ’s unused accrued vacation and any other paid time off calculated at the employeeÂ’s base hourly or salary rate in effect just prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date. 

  

 _Section 6.08_ _No Guarantee of Continued Employment; No Third-Party Rights_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VI or otherwise in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Transferred Employee the right to continue in employment with the Purchaser following the applicable Employee Transfer Date, or is intended to interfere with the PurchaserÂ’s right or ability (i) to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee for any reason or no reason following the applicable Employee Transfer Date or (ii) subject to Section 6.02, to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or 

   ##### 

  

 

arrangement in the sole discretion of the Purchaser. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Article VI are
included for the sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and
shall not create any right in any other Person, including any employees,
former employees, any participant in any employee benefit plan, policy or
arrangement maintained by Sellers or BSC or any beneficiary thereof. 

   

 _Section 6.09_ _Compliance with Law_. BSC, Sellers and the Purchaser agree to comply with all applicable Laws pertaining to the subject matter of this Article VI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties herein expressly acknowledge and agree that (i) any action ostensibly required or permitted under this Article VI shall only be required or permitted to the extent consistent with applicable Law; (ii) applicable Law may also require a party herein to take actions in addition to those it is otherwise contractually obligated to take hereunder; and (iii) any failure of a party hereto to abide by applicable Law pertaining to the subject matter of this Article VI shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement.

of future 

      ##### 

  

    

revenue or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity; _provided_
that the foregoing limitations in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall not

any Seller under this Agreement for any purpose hereunder. 

  

(c) For all purposes of this Article VIII, "Losses" shall be net of any

 _Section 8.05_ _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims; Mixed Actions_. (a) An
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any matter
which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement, within 60 days of such
determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises; _provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article
VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure. 

 

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit,
claim, demand or assessment made by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement or its Affiliates against it which may give rise to a claim for
Losses under this Article VIII (each, together with any matter set forth in
Section 2.02(b)(vii), a " _Third Party Claim_ "), within 60 days of the
receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.
The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its option, to assume and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through
counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to
the Indemnified Party within 45 days of the receipt of such notice from the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake any such
defense against a Third Party Claim the Indemnified Party may, upon giving
prior written notice to the Indemnifying Party, participate in such
defense at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the claim
for indemnification is with respect to a criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation against the Indemnified Party, then
to the extent the Third Party Claim relates to the foregoing, the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to conduct and control the defense of such criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation with counsel of
its choosing, and the reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) if the
Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of 

      ##### 

  

    

such action or claim with counsel of its choosing and the reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party shall be borne
by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party, at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense, all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified PartyÂ’s possession or
under the Indemnified PartyÂ’s control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not settle
such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which may be withheld in the Indemnified PartyÂ’s sole
discretion), enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such settlement,
compromise or judgment (x) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (y) does not include an
unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified
Party and its Affiliates from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim or (z) imposes equitable remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates other than solely the payment of money damages
for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder. If the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnified Party all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s possession or under the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if a Third
Party Claim constitutes a Mixed Action, the parties shall jointly discuss in
good faith a strategy for the conduct and control of a Mixed Action,
including the selection of counsel (the " _Defense Strategy_ "); _provided_
that if the parties cannot agree in writing on the Defense Strategy for such
Mixed Action within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of the
notice referred to above in respect of such Mixed Action, each party shall be
entitled, subject to clause (i) of Section 8.05(b), to assume and control the
defense of the portion of such Mixed Action for which it is responsible or
otherwise may be obligated to indemnify the other party (the " _Assumed
Portion_ "); _provided_ further that each such assuming party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the other party (which may be
withheld in the other partyÂ’s sole discretion), enter into any settlement or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such
Assumed Portion if such settlement, compromise or judgment (x) involves
a finding or admission of wrongdoing by either party or any of its
Affiliates, (y) does not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of the other party and its Affiliates from all
liability in respect of such Assumed Portion, or (z) imposes equitable
remedies or any obligation on the other party or any of its Affiliates in
respect of such Assumed Portion other than solely the payment of money
damages for which the assuming party is responsible or the other party will
be indemnified hereunder. Each party to a Mixed Action may participate in the
defense of the other partyÂ’s Assumed Portion of such Mixed Action (including
by having its representatives and counsel appear at all hearings, depositions
and settlement negotiations related 

      ##### 

  

    

thereto), regardless of whether the Mixed Action is subsequently bifurcated or
otherwise separately tried in part or whole, and will bear the costs and
expenses incurred by it in connection with such participation, unless
otherwise agreed in accordance with the Defense Strategy. Each party shall
also cooperate with the other party in the defense of the other
partyÂ’s Assumed Portion and make available to the other party, at the other
partyÂ’s expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information
in such partyÂ’s possession or under its control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the other party. For purposes of this Agreement, a "
_Mixed Action_ " means any Third Party Claim that a party believes is
reasonably likely to include both (1) claims in respect of which it will be
the Indemnified Party under this Article VIII and (2) claims (A) as to which
no right of indemnification exists for such party under this Article VIII, or
(B) as to which it is the Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII. 

   

 _Section 8.06_ _Tax Treatment_. To the extent permitted by Law, the
parties hereto agree to treat all payments made under this Article VIII,
under any other indemnity provision contained in this Agreement, and for
any misrepresentations or breach of warranties or covenants, as adjustments
to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. 

  

 _Section 8.07_ _Remedies_. The Purchaser and BSC acknowledge and agree
that, (a) following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this
Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchaser and
BSC for any claims under this Agreement, _provided_ that nothing in this
Section 8.07 shall restrict or prohibit any party bringing any action for
fraud, intentional misrepresentation, intentional and material breach or from
seeking specific performance of any obligation hereunder, and (b) anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, except in the case of actual fraud,
no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein shall give rise to any right on the part of the Purchaser or BSC,
after the Closing Date, to rescind this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all
reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses. 

  

 _Section 8.08_ _Set-Off Rights_. 

 

(a) Other than as expressly provided in this Section 8.08, neither party
hereto shall have any right to set-off any amounts determined to be owed
under this Agreement (including by an Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Article VIII) against any amount payable by such party
or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, any of the
Ancillary Agreements or otherwise. 

  

(b) The Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold and set-off against the
Milestone Payments the amount of any Third Party Claim against a Purchaser
Indemnified Party that has been made in writing and in respect of which the
Purchaser has sought indemnification from BSC in accordance with Sections
8.04(a) and 8.05(b) or the amount of any payment due by BSC under Section
14.06 of the Separation Agreement (a " _Set-Off Claim_ ") subject to the
terms of this Section 8.08. 

  

(c) No set-off may be made unless the Purchaser has provided a written
notice of request (a " _Request Notice_ ") in respect of a Set-Off Claim at
least forty-five (45) days 

      ##### 

  

    

prior to the date the Purchaser is required to make a Milestone Payment
pursuant to Section 2.04 (a " _Milestone Payment Date_ "), unless the
Purchaser first receives notice of a Third Party Claim within such forty-five
(45) day period, in which case the Purchaser shall give a Request Notice in
respect of such Set-Off Claim as promptly as practicable (but in no event
later than five (5) Business Days) following receipt of such notice. The
Request Notice shall include (i) a description of the PurchaserÂ’s good faith
basis for determining that such Set-Off Claim gives rise to a right of
indemnification under Section 8.02, and (ii) the PurchaserÂ’s good faith
estimate of the amount of Loss reasonably likely to be incurred by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of such Set-Off Claim (the "
_Requested Set-Off Payment_ "). 

  

(d) If BSC does not deliver written notice to the Purchaser disputing a
Set-Off Claim or the amount of a Requested Set-Off Payment, which notice
shall describe the basis for BSCÂ’s dispute of such Set-Off Claim (a " _Set-
Off Dispute Notice_ "), by 5:00 p.m. New York time on the tenth (10th)
Business Day after BSCÂ’s receipt of the Request Notice, then, as of the
Business Day following the end of such 10 Business Day period, the Purchaser
shall be entitled to withhold and set-off such Requested Set-Off Payment
against the next Milestone Payment in accordance with Section 8.08(h). 

  

(e) If BSC delivers a Set-Off Dispute Notice in accordance with Section
8.08(d), BSC and the Purchaser will attempt in good faith to resolve their
dispute in respect of the Set-Off Claim. If they fail to resolve their
dispute for any reason within ten (10) Business Days after BSCÂ’s delivery of
the Set-Off Dispute Notice to the Purchaser, the dispute shall be arbitrated
in Wilmington, Delaware by a single arbitrator in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and the
expedited procedures thereof (other than, to the extent possible, rule
E-10-Compensation). BSC or the Purchaser shall submit the dispute
to arbitration as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days) after the ten Business Day period referred to above, and
shall instruct the arbitrator to determine only whether the Purchaser is
entitled to set-off all or any portion of the amount of the Requested Set-Off
Payment in accordance with this Section 8.08. The decision of the arbitrator
shall be rendered as promptly as practicable (if possible no later than
thirty (30) days) after the appointment of the arbitrator, or as soon
thereafter as practicable. The decision and award of the arbitrator shall be
deemed final and conclusive for purposes of whether the Purchaser shall
be entitled to set-off the amount of the Requested Set-Off Payment under this
Section 8.08, but not in respect of any other matter relating to such Set-Off
Claim, including whether any Purchaser Indemnified Party is ultimately
determined to be entitled to be indemnified in respect of such Set-Off Claim
under Section 8.02. The decision and award of the arbitrator shall be final
and binding on the parties for the purpose set forth above, and may be
entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. 

  

(f) If the arbitrator rules that the Set-Off Claim is not a claim that
entitles the Purchaser to withhold and set-off all or any portion of the
Requested Set-Off Payment against the next Milestone Payment (the "
_Disallowed Requested Set-Off Payment_ "), the Purchaser shall have no right
to withhold or set-off the Disallowed Requested Set-Off Payment in respect of
such Set-Off Claim and, if the Requested Set-Off Payment in respect of such
Set-Off Claim has previously been deposited in the Escrow Account, BSC shall
be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to release an amount equal to the
Disallowed Requested Set-Off Payment (plus any interest earned on
such Disallowed Requested Set-Off Payment at a rate of interest 

      ##### 

  

    

from time to time publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A. as its prime or
base rate plus 2%) to BSC from the Escrow Account in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

  

(g) If the arbitrator rules that the Purchaser is entitled to set-off all
or any portion of the Requested Set-Off Payment in respect of such Set-Off
Claim (the " _Allowed Requested Set-Off Payment_ "), the Purchaser shall have
the right to withhold and set-off against the Milestone Payments the Allowed
Requested Set-Off Payment in respect of such Set-Off Claim, and the amount
of the Allowed Requested Set-Off Payment may be deposited, or if the
Requested Set-Off Payment has previously been deposited, retained, in the
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

  

(h) If BSC has not delivered a Set-Off Dispute Notice in accordance with
Section 8.08(d), or if the amount of the Requested Set-Off Payment has not
been determined in accordance with this Section 8.08 prior to the date of the
next Milestone Payment Date, the Purchaser shall deposit an amount equal to
the Requested Set-Off Payment into an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_
") on the Milestone Payment Date in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. Otherwise, the amount of the Allowed Requested Set-Off Payment
shall be deposited by the Purchaser in the Escrow Account on such date. The
Requested Set-Off Payment or the Allowed Requested Set-Off Payment
(as applicable) shall be released from the Escrow Account in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 _Section 8.09_ _Information; Waiver_. The right to indemnification or any
other remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants and obligations
in this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance
of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right
to indemnification or any other remedy based on such representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations. 

  

ARTICLE IX 

   

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER 

   

 _Section 9.01_ _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing: 

 

(a) by either BSC or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before the six (6) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the
" _End Date_ "); _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 9.01(a) shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of,
or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to
such date; 

        ##### 

  

    

(b) by either the Purchaser or BSC in the event that any Governmental Order
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall have become final and nonappealable; 

  

(c) by the Purchaser if BSC shall have breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII and which
cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days following written
notice thereof by the Purchaser; 

  

(d) by BSC if the Purchaser shall have breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII and which
cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days following written
notice thereof by BSC; or 

  

(e) by the mutual written consent of BSC and the Purchaser. 

   

 _Section 9.02_ _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability on the part of either party hereto
except (a) as set forth in Section 5.03 and Article X and (b) that nothing
herein shall relieve either party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement occurring prior to such termination. 

  

ARTICLE X

Closing shall have occurred.

 _Section 10.03_ _Public Announcements_. Neither party to this Agreement
shall make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior written
consent of the other party unless otherwise required by Law or applicable
stock exchange regulation, and the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate
as to the timing and contents of any such press release, public announcement
or communication. 

  

 _Section 10.04_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not affected in any manner materially adverse to either party
hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 10.05_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof
and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
between BSC and the Purchaser with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. 

  

 _Section 10.06_ _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by
operation of law or otherwise without the express written consent of BSC and
the Purchaser (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole
discretion of BSC or the Purchaser), as the case may be; _provided_ that the
Purchaser may assign this Agreement or any of its rights and obligations
hereunder to one or more Affiliates of the Purchaser (a " _Purchaser
Affiliate_ ") upon notice to BSC but without the consent of BSC, so long as
any such assignment (a) shall not release the Purchaser from any obligation
or liability hereunder and (b) is not likely to delay the Closing, provided
that BSC acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser may, subject to its
compliance with clause (a) above, assign certain of its rights
and obligations hereunder to the Purchaser Affiliates specified in Schedule
10.06. 

  

 _Section 10.07_ _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, BSC and
the Purchaser or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 10.08. 

  

 _Section 10.08_ _Waiver_. Either party to this Agreement may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other
party pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of
the other party or conditions to such partyÂ’s obligations contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of
any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of
any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of either party
hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of
any of such rights. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise
available. 

  

 _Section 10.09_ _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the provisions
of Article VIII relating to Indemnified Parties, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of
this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 10.10_ _Currency and Exchange Rates_. Unless otherwise specified
in this Agreement, all references to currency, monetary values and dollars
set forth herein shall mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments
hereunder shall be made in United States dollars. In the event that there is
any need to convert U.S. dollars into any foreign currency, or vice versa,
for any purpose under this Agreement, the exchange rate shall be that
published by the Wall Street Journal three (3) Business Days before the date
on which the 

   ##### 

  

 

obligation is paid (or if the Wall Street Journal is not published on such
date, the first date thereafter on which the Wall Street Journal is
published), except as otherwise required by applicable Law (in which case,
the exchange rate shall be determined in accordance with such Law). 

   

 _Section 10.11_ _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the parties hereto could be irreparably damaged if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached and that any non-performance or
breach of this Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately
compensated by monetary damages alone and that the parties hereto would not
have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right
or remedy to which any party hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity
(including monetary damages), such party shall be entitled to seek
enforcement of any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance and to seek temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this
Agreement without posting any bond or other undertaking. 

  

 _Section 10.12_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to choice or conflict of law principles that would result in
the application of any laws other than the laws of the State of Delaware.
Except as provided in Sections 2.03(b), 5.26 and 8.08(e), all Actions arising
out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over
a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware
and any direct appellate court therefrom). Consistent with the preceding
sentence, the parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of any such courts for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement brought by either party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive,
and agree not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such
Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum,
that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by
any of the above-named courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such Action may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party agrees that
notice or the service of process in any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the
manner contemplated by Section 10.02, provided that nothing in this Agreement
shall affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law. 

  

 _Section 10.13_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF THE OTHER 

   ##### 

  

 

PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.13. 

   

 _Section 10.14_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile or pdf transmission) in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of BSC and the Purchaser has caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by its respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
